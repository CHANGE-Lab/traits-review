NH: Working on troubleshooting analyses

FILES INFO:
traits_review_datamanip.Rmd == data manipulation workflow for initial traits_dummy.csv, and subsequent datasets

traits_review_nmds.Rmd == workflow for ordination and nMDS figures for original trait dataset

traits_review_nmds_1.Rmd == workflow for ordination and nMDS figures for primary traits classification dataset

traits_review_nmds_2.Rmd == workflow for ordination and nMDS figures for secondary traits classification dataset

## NOTE, that traits_review_nmds_2.Rmd + traits_review_datamanip.Rmd are needed to troubleshoot problems with outliers in the secondary traits classification dataset. But there is code in other documents if we want to dive into this, I'll need to clean that up.
