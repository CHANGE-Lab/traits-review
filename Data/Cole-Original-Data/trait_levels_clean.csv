I think morphological phenotypic plasticity is a hugely interesting trait, regardless of the purpose it shows a huge potential for functional plasticity. In Hymenopterans it translates to complex functioning of colonies that for example make the European & African bees so hard to eradicate and successful against native pollinators. I guess this leads to a tertiary classification - to do with social organisation. Again, a type of trait that we can use when thinking about many other types of critters. Such as the social organisation of seals is currently considered on a level closer to schooling sharks or fish, than dolphins or whales, that can convey success at some things and not at others.",,NH
