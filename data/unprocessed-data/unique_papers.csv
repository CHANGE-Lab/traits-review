"Abadi, Fitsum; Barbraud, Christophe; Gimenez, Olivier",2017,Integrated population modeling reveals the impact of climate on the survival of juvenile emperor penguins,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Early-life demographic traits are poorly known, impeding our understanding of population processes and sensitivity to climate change. Survival of immature individuals is a critical component of population dynamics and recruitment in particular. However, obtaining reliable estimates of juvenile survival (i.e., from independence to first year) remains challenging, as immatures are often difficult to observe and to monitor individually in the field. This is particularly acute for seabirds, in which juveniles stay at sea and remain undetectable for several years. In this work, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model to estimate the juvenile survival of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), and other demographic parameters including adult survival and fecundity of the species. Using this statistical method, we simultaneously analyzed capture-recapture data of adults, the annual number of breeding females, and the number of fledglings of emperor penguins collected at Dumont d'Urville, Antarctica, for the period 1971-1998. We also assessed how climate covariates known to affect the species foraging habitats and prey [southern annular mode (SAM), sea ice concentration (SIC)] affect juvenile survival. Our analyses revealed that there was a strong evidence for the positive effect of SAM during the rearing period (SAMR) on juvenile survival. Our findings suggest that this large-scale climate index affects juvenile emperor penguins body condition and survival through its influence on wind patterns, fast ice extent, and distance to open water. Estimating the influence of environmental covariates on juvenile survival is of major importance to understand the impacts of climate variability and change on the population dynamics of emperor penguins and seabirds in general and to make robust predictions on the impact of climate change on marine predators.",10.1111/gcb.13538,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Marine,Birds,Tundra,0,0,0,1,0,Life History,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Climate Change,0,1,1,1,"Traits Used = fecundity, juvenile survival, number of breeding pairs. **I put F because I couldn't think of how these traits would confer information that would give us anything more than this - do we think this paper is relevant given that I can't see any connection of these traits to actual environmental filtering?

Trait-based approaches have the potential to reveal general and predictive relationships between organisms and ecosystem functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional structure of communities are still unclear. Within terrestrial ecosystems, several studies have shown that many ecological processes are controlled by the interacting above-and belowground compartments. However, few studies have used traits to reveal the functional relationships between plants and soil fauna. Mostly, research combining plants and soil fauna solely used the traits of one assemblage in predictive studies. 2. Above-ground (plants) and below-ground (Collembola) compartments were sampled over a flooding gradient in northern France along the Seine River. First, we measured the effect of flooding on functional and taxonomic assembly within both communities. We then considered the linkages between plant and Collembolan species richness, community traits and assessed whether traits of both compartments converged at high flooding intensity (abiotic filtering) and diverged when this constraint is released (biotic filtering). 3. Species richness of both taxa followed the same bell-shaped pattern along the gradient, while a similar significant pattern of functional richness was only observed for plants. Further analyses revealed a progressive shift from trait convergence to divergence for plants, but not for Collembola, as constraints intensity decreased. Instead, our results highlighted that Collembola traits were mainly linked to the variations in plant traits. This leads, within Collembola assemblages, to convergence of a subset of perception and habitat-related traits for which the relationship with plant traits was assessed. 4. Synthesis. Using a trait-based approach, our study highlighted that functional relationships occur between above-and below-ground compartments. We underlined that functional composition of plant communities plays a key role in structuring Collembola assemblages in addition to the role of abiotic variables. Our study clearly shows that functional diversity provides a new approach to link the above-and below-ground compartments and might, therefore, be further considered when studying ecological processes at the interface between both compartments.",10.1111/1365-2435.12718,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,1,1,1,1,0,"Morphological, Physiological, Life History",3,0,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,1,0,1,,"*Looked at functional traits and taxonomic assembly.

"Abrams, PA",2019,How Does the Evolution of Universal Ecological Traits Affect Population Size? Lessons from Simple Models,AMERICAN NATURALIST,"This article argues that adaptive evolutionary change in a consumer species should frequently decrease (and maladaptive change should increase) population size, producing adaptive decline. This conclusion is based on analysis of multiple consumer-resource models that examine evolutionary change in consumer traits affecting the universal ecological parameters of attack rate, conversion efficiency, and mortality. Two scenarios are investigated. In one, evolutionary equilibrium is initially maintained by opposing effects on the attack rate and other growth rate parameters; the environment or trait is perturbed, and the trait then evolves to a new (or back to a previous) equilibrium. Here evolution exhibits adaptive decline in up to one-half of all cases. The other scenario assumes a genetic perturbation having purely fitness-increasing effects. Here adaptive decline in the consumer requires that the resource be self-reproducing and overexploited and requires a sufficient increase in the attack rate. However, if the resource exhibits adaptive defense via behavior or evolution, adaptive decline may characterize consumer traits affecting all parameters. Favorable environmental change producing parameter shifts similar to those produced by adaptive evolution has similar counterintuitive effects on consumer population size. Many different food web models have already been shown to exhibit such counterintuitive changes in some species.",10.1086/703155,Y,0,0,0,0,0,0,T Model,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,1,"Behavioural, Life History",2,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = attack rate, conversion efficiency, mortality",
"Abrams, PA",2012,THE ECO-EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES OF A GENERALIST CONSUMER TO RESOURCE COMPETITION,EVOLUTION,"This article explores the combined evolutionary and ecological responses of resource uptake abilities in a generalist consumer to exploitative competition for one resource using a simple 2-resource model. It compares the sizes of ecologically and evolutionarily caused changes in population densities in cases where the original consumer has a strong or a weak trade-off in its abilities to consume the two resources. The analysis also compares the responses of the original species to competition when the competitor's population size is or is not limited by the shared resource. Although divergence in resource use traits in the resident generalist consumer is expected under all scenarios when resources are substitutable, the changes in population densities of the resources and resident consumer frequently differ between scenarios. The population of the original consumer often decreases as a result of its own adaptive divergence, and this decrease is often much greater than the initial ecological decrease. If the evolving consumer has a strong trade-off, the overlapped resource increases in equilibrium population density in response to being consumed by a generalist competitor. Some of these predictions differ qualitatively in alternative scenarios involving sustained variation in population densities or nutritionally essential resources.",10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01659.x,N,0,0,0,0,0,0,T Model,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,,,,,NA,NA,0,0,0,,,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,,"Not applicable to our study IMO, but curious to get a second opinion",
"ABRAMS, PA; MATSUDA, H",1994,THE EVOLUTION OF TRAITS THAT DETERMINE ABILITY IN COMPETITIVE CONTESTS,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"We analyse mathematical models of the evolution of a trait that determines ability in contest competition. We assume that the value of the competitive trait affects two different components of fitness, one measuring the benefit of winning contests and the other measuring the cost of developing the competitive trait. Unlike previous analyses, we include the population dynamical consequences of larger competitive trait values. Exaggeration of the competitive trait reduces the mean probability of survival during the non-competitive stage of the life cycle. The resulting lower population density reduces competition and, therefore, reduces the advantages of greater competitive ability. Models without population dynamics often predict dimorphism in the competitive trait when resource possession is decided by interactions with many other individuals. If the competition involves a contest with a single other individual, models without population dynamics often predict cycles of increase and collapse in the trait or a continual increase, possibly resulting in extinction. When population dynamics are included, both of these results become less likely and a single stable trait value becomes more likely. Population dynamics also make it possible to have dimorphism when individuals have a single pairwise contest and alternative stable trait values when an individual has many contests. Increases in the value of the resource being contested may increase or decrease the evolutionarily stable size of the trait. Competition between very differently sized species will often decrease size in the larger species (character convergence).",10.1007/BF01237849,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"ABRAMS, PA; MATSUDA, H; HARADA, Y",1993,EVOLUTIONARILY UNSTABLE FITNESS MAXIMA AND STABLE FITNESS MINIMA OF CONTINUOUS TRAITS,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"We present models of adaptive change in continuous traits for the following situations: (1) adaptation of a single trait within a single population in which the fitness of a given individual depends on the population's mean trait value as well as its own trait value; (2) adaptation of two (or more) traits within a single population; (3) adaptation in two or more interacting species. We analyse a dynamic model of these adaptive scenarios in which the rate of change of the mean trait value is an increasing function of the fitness gradient (i.e. the rate of increase of individual fitness with the individual's trait value). Such models have been employed in evolutionary game theory and are often appropriate both for the evolution of quantitative genetic traits and for the behavioural adjustment of phenotypically plastic traits. The dynamics of the adaptation of several different ecologically important traits can result in characters that minimize individual fitness and can preclude evolution towards characters that maximize individual fitness. We discuss biological circumstances that are likely to produce such adaptive failures for situations involving foraging, predator avoidance, competition and coevolution. The results argue for greater attention to dynamical stability in models of the evolution of continuous traits.",10.1007/BF01237642,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"ABTS, ML",1987,"ENVIRONMENT AND VARIATION IN LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OF THE CHUCKWALLA, SAUROMALUS-OBESUS",ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"Life history attributes for the western chuckwalla, Sauromalus obesus, and environmental variables, e.g., rainfall and vegetational growth, were recorded simultaneously during a 7—yr investigation in the Colorado desert of southeastern California. The timing of rainfall was most critical to the growth of annual plants, and the standing crop of winter annuals was greatest when substantial rainfall occurred early (October—January). Chuckwallas preferred to eat winter annuals during the spring. However, broad and opportunistic feeding habits were observed, and the persistence of relatively mild winters and frequent summer rainfall enabled individuals to feed throughout most of the year. Males typically achieved reproductive maturity at 125 mm snout—vent length (SVL) and 2 yr of age. Females achieved reproductive maturity at 125 mm SVL and 2—3 yr only when optimal environmental conditions prevailed. Clutch size was highly correlated with body size, and the mean for the study period was 6.9 eggs. Mean values for other reproductive attributes were: egg mass, 8.4 g; relative clutch mass (RCM), 0.343; and expenditure per progeny (EPP), 0.053. Clutch size, egg mass, RCM, and EPP did not differ significantly among years for a given body size. Mean annual frequency of reproduction was 52%, but ranged from 0 to 95% during the study period. Mean 1st—yr survivorship was 38% but showed considerable year—to—year variability. Egg mortality had the greatest impact on 1st—yr survivorship. Mean survivorship for chuck—wallas older than 1 yr approached 75% and values for males and females were not significantly different. Adults of both sexes appeared to be considerably more susceptible to predation after achieving 165 mm SVL. Consequently, large adult individuals were never common. Annual recruitment was 20% and was largely the result of reproduction. Population densities showed nearly a twofold annual variation, ranging from 15 to 30 individuals/ha. Life table analysis showed that younger females (3—6 yr) contributed to 50% of the replacement rate; mean generation time was 8.2 yr, and the life expectancy was ≈15 yr. Year—to—year consistency of various reproductive attributes (clutch size, egg mass, and RCM), indicative of ""boom or bust"" iteroparity, is possibly a typical adaption for extremely long—lived lizard species. Relatively mild winters and occurrence of summer rainfall in the Colorado desert greatly promoted early maturity and frequent reproductions. In addition, summer rainfall improved the survivorship of eggs, probably by providing adequate moisture for incubation. Such conditions were responsible for relatively high densities and predation rates. However, under drier conditions maturity was delayed, reproduction less frequent, and egg survivorship much lower; such conditions are typical in the Mojave desert. The relative stability of clutch size, egg mass, and RCM, but apparent variability of age at reproductive maturity and reproductive frequency in this study, may indicate that the life history of chuckwallas evolved under a variable but predictable environmental setting.",10.2307/2937081,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Herps,Desert,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,"Traits Used = diet preference, length at maturity, body size, clutch size, egg mass, relative clutch mass, expenditure per progeny, annual frequency of reporudction, survivorship year to year, susceptibility to predation, annual recruitment, mean generation time, life expectancy.

However, the mechanisms behind such relationships at large spatial scales are not fully understood. Here we adopt the functional biogeography approach to investigate how the size composition of phytoplankton communities relates to primary production and export production along a broad latitudinal gradient. Using in situ phytoplankton size distribution data and a trait-based model, we find an increase in the average phytoplankton size, size diversity, primary production and export when moving from low to high latitudes. Our analysis indicates that the interplay between spatio-temporal heterogeneities in environmental conditions and a trade-off between the high affinity for nutrients of smaller cells and the ability to avoid predation by larger cells are the main mechanisms driving the observed patterns. Our results also suggest that variations in size diversity alone do not directly lead to changes in primary production and export. The trade-off thus introduces a feedback that influences the relationship between size diversity and ecosystem functions. These findings support the importance of environmentally mediated trade-offs as crucial mechanisms shaping biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships at large spatial scales.",10.1098/rspb.2018.0621,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Plankton,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,Taxonomic is phytoplankton.

Previous studies have mainly investigated linear relationships between signals and survival, but both hump-shaped and U-shaped relationships can also be predicted, depending on the main costs involved in trait expression. Furthermore, few studies have taken the plasticity of signals into account in viability selection analyses. The relationship between signal expression and survival is of particular interest in melanin-based traits, because their main costs are still debated. Here, we first determined the main factors explaining variability in a melanin-based trait linked to dominance: the bib size of a colonial bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius. We then used these analyses to obtain a measure representative of the individual mean expression of bib size. Finally, we used capture-recapture models to study how survival varied in relation to bib size. Variation in bib size was strongly affected by year and moderately affected by age, body condition and colony size. In addition, individuals bearing small and large bibs had higher survival than those with intermediate bibs, and this U-shaped relationship between survival and bib size appeared to be more pronounced in some years than others. These results constitute a rare example of disruptive viability selection, and point towards the potential importance of social costs incurred by the dominance signalling function of badges of status.",10.1111/jeb.12717,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Birds,Tropical Seasonal Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = measure of bib size, body mass, tarsus length, age, sex",
"Ackerly, DD",2000,"Taxon sampling, correlated evolution, and independent contrasts",EVOLUTION,"Independent contrasts are widely used to incorporate phylogenetic information into studies of continuous traits, particularly analyses of evolutionary trait correlations, but the effects of taxon sampling on these analyses have received little attention. In this paper, simulations were used to investigate the effects of taxon sampling patterns and alternative branch length assignments on the statistical performance of correlation coefficients and sign tests; ''full-tree'' analyses based on contrasts at all nodes and ''paired-comparisons'' based only on contrasts of terminal taxon pairs were also compared. The simulations showed that random samples, with respect to the traits under consideration, provide statistically robust estimates of trait correlations. However, exact significance tests are highly dependent on appropriate branch length information; equal branch lengths maintain lower Type I error than alternative topological approaches, and adjusted critical values of the independent contrast correlation coefficient are provided for use with equal branch lengths. Nonrandom samples, with respect to univariate or bivariate trait distributions, introduce discrepancies between interspecific and phylogenetically structured analyses and bias estimates of underlying evolutionary correlations. Examples of nonrandom sampling processes may include community assembly processes, convergent evolution under local adaptive pressures, selection of a nonrandom sample of species from a habitat or life-history group, or investigator bias. Correlation analyses based on species pairs comparisons, while ignoring deeper relationships, entail significant loss of statistical power and as a result provide a conservative test of trait associations. Paired comparisons in which species differ by a large amount in one trait, a method introduced in comparative plant ecology, have appropriate Type I error rates and high statistical power, but do not correctly estimate the magnitude of trait correlations. Sign tests, based on full-tree or paired-comparison approaches, are highly reliable across a wide range of sampling scenarios, in terms of Type I error rates, but have very low power.

"Ackerly, DD",2003,"Community assembly, niche conservatism, and adaptive evolution in changing environments",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,"The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the ""fit"" of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e. g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i. e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a ""mismatch"" between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of ""environmental islands"" (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of ""trailing-edge"" populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.",10.1086/368401,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,1,0,1,0,0,Physiological,2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,,

We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities.

However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition.

Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood.

However, the adaptation process may be impeded or slowed down by several constraints or trade-offs between conflicting functions. This is frequently observed by ecomorphological studies focusing on lower taxonomic levels: form-function relationships get blurred because subtle adaptive traits remain hidden or simply do not exist. Therefore, a rigorous analytic approach is required. (ideally) assessing the links between the four stages of the adaptive process simultaneously (i.e., from generic variation to variation in design, to variation in performance, to differential fitness), taking into consideration all potential factors hindering the normal progression of this process. Lizard locomotion is a good model for such an analysis. Locomotion is essential in many ecologically relevant functions (feeding, predator avoidance, etc.). It consists of several components (speed. acceleration, endurance, manoeuvrability, etc.) and modes (level running, climbing, etc.) with conflicting demands, leading to potential trade-offs. Moreover, several of its components proved to be heritable and obvious relations between habitat use and locomotor design are often absent (e.g., in lacertid lizards). Two cases, focusing on the potential trade-off between climbing and level-running, are presented to illustrate the subtle interplay between variation in ecology, performance and design in lizard locomotion. (1) For two gekkotans (a climber and aground dwelling species) the moments exerted by several important leg muscles appear to be tuned to their primary mode of locomotion. (2) In two sibling lacertid species, the inverse trade-off between climbing and running, put forward on the basis of observed substrate use, does not exist. Instead, a drastic difference in running performance, likely related to different running styles, emerged. The latter ease illustrates the potential use of 'integrated, dynamic design traits' as an intermediate stage between variation in design and performance.",10.1163/156854200505865,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Here we study the unusual coexistence of 10 similar congeneric species of Anelosimus spiders within a small forest fragment in Madagascar. We asked if these species radiated in sympatry or allopatry, and if there was evidence for local-scale character displacement in body size and other species-level traits. We sampled similar to 350 colonies (6346 individuals) along a 2800 m transect. We identified colonies using morphology and DNA barcoding, and tested the monophyly of local and regional species assemblages with time-calibrated phylogenies. We used null model analysis and phylogenetic signal inference to test for patterns of segregation in body size, microhabitat, phenology, and seasonality of coexisting species. We found that all species belong to a Madagascan clade that radiated during the Pliocene, but that contemporary local assemblages are non-monophyletic. This is consistent with allopatric speciation during periods of global cooling and expansion of grasslands, and subsequent species assembly as forest fragments re-expanded and coalesced. We found no evidence for character displacement, except for overdispersion and even spacing in phenology: species were segregated by instars in a manner consistent with resource partitioning or maintenance of reproductive isolation. Overdispersion or even spacing in phenology may contribute to coexistence either through resource partitioning or mate recognition. However, there was no support for a scenario of resource partitioning and divergence of body size or other correlated morphological characters.

As tools, most powerful are those phylogerries that contain all, or nearly all, of the taxa of a given group. Despite their obvious utility, such phylogenies, other than summary 'supertrees', are currently lacking for most mammalian orders, including the order Carnivora. Carnivora consists of about 270 extant species including most of the World's large terrestrial predators (e.g., the big cats, wolves, bears), as well as many of man's favorite wild (panda, cheetah, tiger) and domesticated animals (dog, cat). Distributed globally, carnivores are highly diverse ecologically, having occupied all major habitat types on the planet and being diverse in traits such as sociality, communication, body/brain size, and foraging ecology. Thus, numerous studies continue to address comparative questions within the order, highlighting the need for a detailed species-level phylogery. Here we present a phylogeny of Carnivora that increases taxon sampling density from 28% in the most detailed primary-data study to date, to 82% containing 243 taxa (222 extant species, 17 subspecies). In addition to extant species, we sampled four extinct species: American cheetah, saber-toothed cat, cave bear and the giant short-faced bear. Bayesian analysis of cytochrome b sequences data-mined from GenBank results in a phylogenetic hypothesis that is largely congruent with prior studies based on fewer taxa but more characters. We find support for the monophyly of Carnivora, its major division into Caniformia and Feliformia, and for all but one family within the order. The only exception is the placement ofthe kinkajou outside Procyonidae, however, prior studies have already cast doubt on its family placement. In contrast, at the subfamily and genus level, our results indicate numerous problems with current classification. Our results also propose new, controversial hypotheses, such as the possible placement of the red panda (Ailuridae) sister to canids (Caniclae). Our results confirm previous findings suggesting that the dog was domesticated from the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus 1upus) and are congruent with the Near East domestication of the cat. In sum, this study presents the most detailed species-level phylogeny ofCarnivora to date and a much needed tool for comparative studies of carnivoran species. To demonstrate one such use, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary distinctiveness (EDGE), which can be used to help establish conservation priorities. According with those criteria, and under one of the many possible sets of parameters, the highest priority Carnivora species for conservation of evolutionary diversity include: monk seals, giant and red panda, giant otter, otter civet, Owston's palm civet, sea otter, Liberian mongoose, spectacled bear, walrus, binturong, and the fossa.

"Agrawal, AA; Kotanen, PM; Mitchell, CE; Power, AG; Godsoe, W; Klironomos, J",2005,Enemy release? An experiment with congeneric plant pairs and diverse above- and belowground enemies,ECOLOGY,"Several hypotheses. proposed to explain the success of introduced species focus on altered interspecific interactions. One of the most prominent, the Enemy Release Hypothesis, posits that invading species benefit compared to their native counterparts if they lose their herbivores and pathogens during the invasion process. We previously reported on a common garden experiment (from 2002) in which we compared levels of herbivory between 30 taxonomically paired native and introduced old-field plants. In this phylogenetically controlled comparison, herbivore damage tended to be higher on introduced than on native plants. This striking pattern, the opposite of current theory, prompted us to further investigate herbivory and several other interspecific interactions in a series of linked experiments with the same set of species. Here we show that, in these new experiments, introduced plants, on average, received less insect herbivory and were subject to half the negative soil microbial feedback compared to natives; attack by fungal and viral pathogens also tended to be reduced on introduced plants compared to natives. Although plant traits (foliar C:N, toughness, and water content) suggested that introduced species should be less resistant to generalist consumers, they were not consistently more heavily attacked. Finally, we used meta-analysis to combine data from this study with results from our previous work to show that escape generally was inconsistent among guilds of enemies: there were few instances in which escape from multiple guilds occurred for a taxonomic pair, and more cases in which the patterns of escape from different enemies canceled out. Our examination of multiple interspecific interactions demonstrates that escape from one guild of enemies does not necessarily imply escape from other guilds. Because the effects of each guild are likely to vary through space and time, the net effect of all enemies is also likely to be variable. The net effect of these interactions may create ""invasion opportunity windows"": times when introduced species make advances in native communities.",10.1890/05-0219,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,2,0,0,1,,1,1,T,0,Invasion,0,1,1,,"They also performed a meta analysis but it was about a part of the paper I didn't think was as relevant, so only scored it as experiment -- curious about the statement about how the morphology predicts the predation stuff, is that something we need to take into account?",

Species respond to such environmental modifications by adapting to new conditions or by shifting their geographic distributions towards more suitable areas. The latter might be constrained by species' functional traits that influence their ability to move, reproduce or establish. Here, we show that functional traits related to dispersal, reproduction, habitat use and diet have influenced how three pollinator groups (bees, butterflies and hoverflies) responded to changes in climate and land-use in the Netherlands since 1950. Across the three pollinator groups, we found pronounced areal range expansions (>53%) and modelled range shifts towards the north (all taxa: 17-22 km), west (bees: 14 km) and east (butterflies: 11 km). The importance of specific functional traits for explaining distributional changes varied among pollinator groups. Larval diet preferences (i.e. carnivorous vs. herbivorous/detritivorous and nitrogen values of host plants, respectively) were important for hoverflies and butterflies, adult body size for hoverflies, and flight period length for all groups.

Functional traits have been extensively used to describe, group and rank species according to their functions. There is now growing evidence that intraspecific functional variability, as well as interspecific variability, can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. A core hypothesis for the use of functional traits expressed as species means, that their intraspecific variability is negligible compared with their interspecific variability, has however been too rarely tested empirically. We then addressed four questions: Is intraspecific functional variability across species ranges negligible compared with interspecific variability? Are the major resource economics trade-off and functional strategies robust to individual trait variability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species ranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be discriminated by their leaf traits? 2. Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine catchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant species with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations from a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each species across their ranges. 3. With an original combination of single-trait and multi-trait analyses, we highlighted a non-negligible contribution of intraspecific variability to overall functional trait variability (similar to 30%). Although not affecting general and well-known functional trade-offs and strategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to alter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than a clear-cut species classification. 4. Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be considered as negligible - species being represented by mean trait values -, or not - species being represented by multivariate trait distributions -, is an essential question for multiple ecological issues.

Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values. 2. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories. 3. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic. 4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients.

All else being equal, larger home ranges should be associated with longer daily movement distances and/or higher average movement speeds. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption ((V) overdotO(2)max) generally sets an upper limit to the intensity of work (e.g., speed of locomotion) that an animal can sustain without fatigue. Therefore, home range area and (V) overdotO(2)max are predicted to evolve in concert (coadapt). We gathered literature data on home range and (V) overdotO(2)max for 55 species of mammals. We computed residuals from log-log (allometric) regressions on body mass with two different regression models: ordinary least squares (OLS) and phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS). Residuals were weakly positively related for both the OLS (r = 0,278, one-tailed P < 0,05) and PGLS (r = 0.210, P > 0.05) regressions. For tib,max, the PGLS regression model had a slightly higher likelihood than the 01,5 model, but the situation was reversed for home range area. In addition, for both home range area and Vo,max, models that fit better than either OLS or PGLS were obtained by modeling residual variation with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to mimic stabilizing selection (RegOU), indicating that phylogenetic signal is present in both size-adjusted traits, consistent with findings of previous studies. (However, residuals from the RegOU models cannot be tested for correlation due to mathematical complexities.)

Such replacement processes can drive the temporal change in species abundance in a plant community. Can we predict the dynamics of a real plant community using observational data on plant-plant recruitment interactions? What would be the relative importance of recruitment interactions vs life-history traits in determining community dynamics? LocationForest communities dominated by Pinus halepensis and Quercus ilex in SE Spain. MethodsWe develop a continuous time non-linear model that can be easily parameterized with empirical data for the interactions between adult and juvenile plants recruiting beneath them. These interactions form a complex replacement network (or matrix) that is the backbone of the model. We parameterize the model with life-history data from the literature and from recruitment interactions observed in a successional community 12yr after a forest fire. We explore the behaviour of the model under different intensities of chronic disturbance, and after modifications of the structure of the replacement network and the values of the parameters. ResultsThe model predicts that the current community of the burned area will develop into a forest very similar quantitatively to the surrounding mature forests, as long as the rates of chronic disturbance remain very low. For increasingly higher levels of chronic disturbance, the community would reach stable states resembling a mixed pine-oak forest, a degraded oak forest, an oak dehesa and, finally, a steppe-like vegetation. All these types of plant assemblages can currently be found throughout the study area. These predictions are less sensitive to variation in the estimates of species' life history (i.e. growth, death and colonization rates) than to variation in the structure of the recruitment matrix.

An observational approach was used to compare seed rain among microhabitats, and how it was affected by seed predation. The relation of microhabitat, scrub density, and seed size with predation risk uas explored by a field experiment. Seed density ranged from 0 seeds/m(2) in open places to 93.2 seeds/m(2) under O. europaea. The overall predation rate was low, as shown in the observational approach (35%). The mean percentage of predation in the experimental approach was 51%, ranging across microhabitats between 28% and 88%. It was higher in dense scrub patches (67%) than in sparse ones (33%), and lower for large seeds (42%) than for medium and small ones (57% and 55%, respectively). Finally, seed density near seed depots did not increase their probability of being detected by rodents or the predation rate. Although predation rates were low, wild olive seeds could be frequently found by rodents due to their spatial ubiquity and local abundance. Together with the efficient foraging strategy of predators (92% of experimental seed depots a ere found), this allowed a widespread post-dispersal predation, but it did not modify the relative distribution of seeds among microhabitats. Thus? in our study, the seed dispersal pattern of the wild olive tree was not reshaped by post-dispersal predation. because (1) rodents did not alter significantly its initial spatial distribution and (2) mice did not seem to limit the number of recruits.

Individual-based models can shed light on community assembly mechanisms, by allowing observed spatiotemporal patterns to emerge from first principles about the modeled organisms. Previous work in the Rance estuary (Brittany, France) revealed the principal functional components of its benthic macroinvertebrate communities and derived a set of functional relationships between them. These elements were combined here for the development of a dynamic and spatially explicit model that operates at two spatial scales. At the fine scale, modeling each individual's life cycle allowed the representation of recruitment, inter-and intra-group competition, biogenic habitat modification and predation mortality. Larval dispersal and environmental filtering due to the tidal characteristics of the Rance estuary were represented at the coarse scale. The two scales were dynamically linked and the model was parameterized on the basis of theoretical expectations and expert knowledge. The model was able to reproduce some patterns of alpha-and beta-diversity that were observed in the Rance estuary in 1995. Model analysis demonstrated the role of local and regional processes, particularly early post-settlement mortality and spatially restricted dispersal, in shaping marine benthos. It also indicated biogenic habitat modification as a promising area for future research. The combination of this mechanism with different substrate types, along with the representation of physical disturbances and more trophic categories, could increase the model's realism.

This hypothesis is based on the assumption that common ancestry causes close relatives to share biological traits that lead to greater ecological similarity. Although intuitively appealing, the extent to which phylogeny can predict competition and co-occurrence among species has only recently been rigorously tested, with mixed results. When studies have failed to support the CRH, critics have pointed out at least three limitations: (i) the use of data poor phylogenies that provide inaccurate estimates of species relatedness, (ii) the use of inappropriate statistical models that fail to detect relationships between relatedness and species interactions amidst nonlinearities and heteroskedastic variances, and (iii) overly simplified laboratory conditions that fail to allow eco-evolutionary relationships to emerge. Here, we address these limitations and find they do not explain why evolutionary relatedness fails to predict the strength of species interactions or probabilities of coexistence among freshwater green algae. First, we construct a new data-rich, transcriptome-based phylogeny of common freshwater green algae that are commonly cultured and used for laboratory experiments. Using this new phylogeny, we re-analyse ecological data from three previously published laboratory experiments. After accounting for the possibility of nonlinearities and heterogeneity of variances across levels of relatedness, we find no relationship between phylogenetic distance and ecological traits. In addition, we show that communities of North American green algae are randomly composed with respect to their evolutionary relationships in 99% of 1077 lakes spanning the continental United States. Together, these analyses result in one of the most comprehensive case studies of how evolutionary history influences species interactions and community assembly in both natural and experimental systems.

Methods Focusing on 26 species of Anolis lizards, we used multivariate adaptive regression splines to evaluate the contribution of climate, species interactions, phylogenetic history and dispersal limitation to species distributional limits. For each species, we mapped the morphological similarity of congenerics using traits of known ecological import and predicted that species would be less likely to occur in climatically suitable areas if they were inhabited by ecologically similar species. Dispersal limitation was incorporated by generating spatially explicit estimates of dispersal cost, based on inferred habitat suitability. We compared models including morphological similarity, dispersal cost, phylogeny and climate with climate-only models. Results were evaluated against a null model that conserved the spatial structure of species occurrences. Results Climate had a dominant role in shaping species distributions.

In stable environments, if faithful replication is costless, theory predicts that mutation rates will evolve to zero. However, positive mutation rates can evolve in novel or fluctuating environments, as analytical and empirical studies have shown. Previous work on this question has focused on environments that fluctuate independently of the evolving population. Here we consider fluctuations that arise from frequency-dependent selection in the evolving population itself. We investigate how the dynamics of competing traits can induce selective pressure on the rates of mutation between these traits. To address this question, we introduce a theoretical framework combining replicator dynamics and adaptive dynamics. We suppose that changes in mutation rates are rare, compared to changes in the traits under direct selection, so that the expected evolutionary trajectories of mutation rates can be obtained from analysis of pairwise competition between strains of different rates. Depending on the nature of frequency-dependent trait dynamics, we demonstrate three possible outcomes of this competition. First, if trait frequencies are at a mutation-selection equilibrium, lower mutation rates can displace higher ones. Second, if trait dynamics converge to a heteroclinic cycle-arising, for example, from ""rock-paper-scissors"" interactions-mutator strains succeed against non-mutators. Third, in cases where selection alone maintains all traits at positive frequencies, zero and nonzero mutation rates can coexist indefinitely.

Here, we model the assembly dynamics of the largest breeding seabird community in the Mediterranean basin during the last 30 years. This unique data set allowed us to test, through a ""natural experiment,"" whether body size drove the assembly and dynamics of an ecological guild growing from very low numbers after habitat protection. Although environmental stochasticity accounted for most of community variability, the population variance explained by interspecific interactions, albeit small, decreased sharply with increasing body size. Since we found a demographic gradient along a body size continuum, in which population density and stability increase with increasing body size, the numerical effects of interspecific interactions were proportionally higher on smaller species than on larger ones. Moreover, we found that the per capita interaction coefficients were larger the higher the size ratio among competing species, but only for the set of interactions in which the species exerting the effect was greater. This provides empirical evidence for long-term asymmetric interspecific competition, which ultimately prompted the local extinction of two small species during the study period. During the assembly process stochastic predation by generalist carnivores further triggered community reorganizations and global decays in population synchrony, which disrupted the pattern of interspecific interactions. These results suggest that the major patterns detected in complex food webs can hold as well for simpler sub-modules of these networks involving non-trophic interactions, and highlight the shifting ecological processes impacting on assembling vs. asymptotic communities.",10.1890/11-0181.1,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,"Observational, Q Model",Marine,Birds,Mediterranean Basin,0,1,0,0,0,Morophological,1,0,0,1,,,1,E,0,0,0,0,1,,,

In general, these methods implicitly assume natural selection acting at the species level, thus implying the mechanism of species selection. However, natural selection acting at the organismal level could also influence diversification patterns (i.e., effect macroevolution). Owing to our scarce knowledge on multi-level selection regarding niche as a trait, we propose a conceptual model to discuss and guide the test between species selection and effect macroevolution within a hierarchical framework. We first assume niche as an organismal as well as a species' trait that interacts with the environment and results in species-level differential fitness. Then, we argue that niche heritability, a requirement for natural selection, can be assessed by its phylogenetic signal. Finally, we propose several predictions that can be tested in the future by disentangling both types of evolutionary processes (species selection or effect macroevolution).

"Anas, MUM; Scott, KA; Wissel, B",2013,Suitability of presence vs. absence indicator species to characterize stress gradients: Lessons from zooplankton species of boreal lakes,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Indicator species are species that readily reflect some measure of habitat characteristics and have become an increasingly appealing tool in environmental monitoring. Traditionally, habitat conditions were derived based on the presence of specific indicator species, but the absence of indicator species may be just as informative. To evaluate the importance of presence vs. absence of indicator species for characterizing habitats across environmental gradients, we evaluated the interactions of zooplankton and acid-stress in 244 boreal lakes. We adopted the statistical methods proposed by Dufrene and Legendre (1997) to identify presence and absence indicator species to characterize high, intermediate and low acid-stress lake categories. Presence indicator species (identified by the statistical analysis) for highly stressed lakes were not entirely appropriate because further evaluation identified them as ubiquitous generalists. In contrast, absence indicators for highly stressed lakes were more appropriate as these habitat specialists were specifically absent from this category of lakes. On the other hand, presence indicators for the low acid-stress category were largely habitat specialists and therefore appropriate indicators. However there were no presence or absence indicators for lakes at intermediate acid-stress level. Thus the combined use of both presence and absence indicators is recommended to characterize habitats across a stress gradient. To evaluate if the successful application of this combined approach is dependent on a stress gradient, we applied the same analyses to a sub-set of uninfluenced (non-sensitive) lakes representing three different environmental conditions. This approach identified statistically significant presence and absence. indicator species for all three different reference conditions. Yet, the absence-based approach was not essential under unstressed conditions, as presence indicator species were habitat specialists for all reference categories. Finally, this study also emphasizes the importance of meaningful ecological traits of species in order to ensure the appropriateness of statistically selected indicator species.

We found that most variation in LES traits is often, but not universally, at high taxonomic levels (between families or genera in a family). However, we found that trait covariation shows distinct taxonomic scale dependence, with some trait correlations showing opposite signs within vs. across species. LES traits responded independently to environmental gradients within species, with few shared environmental responses across traits or across scales.

Here, I present a conceptual framework for this intra-specific hydraulic trait variability, reviewing the mechanisms that drive variability and the consequences for vegetation response to climate change. I performed a meta-analysis on published studies (n=33) of intra-specific variation in a prominent hydraulic trait - water potential at which 50% stem conductivity is lost (P50) - and compared this variation to inter-specific variability within genera and plant functional types used by a dynamic global vegetation model. I found that intra-specific variability is of ecologically relevant magnitudes, equivalent to c. 33% of the inter-specific variability within a genus, and is larger in angiosperms than gymnosperms, although the limited number of studies highlights that more research is greatly needed.

Whilst this is consistent with many previous observations, it is substantially less than observed in rapidly declining cod stocks, suggesting additional evolutionary processes may affect them.

We review and analyse studies on morphological trait complementarity (e.g. floral tube length versus insect mouthpart length) at the population and species level.Results: Plants have consistently more exaggerated morphological traits than insects at high trait magnitudes and in some cases less exaggerated traits than insects at smaller trait magnitudes. This result held at the population level, as well as for phylogenetically adjusted analyses at the species-level and for both pollination and host-parasite interactions, perhaps suggesting a general pattern. Across communities, the degree of trait mismatch between one specialist plant and its more generalized pollinator was related to the level of pollinator specialization at each site; the observed pattern supports the ""life-dinner principle"" of selection acting more strongly on species with more at stake in the interaction. Similarly, plant mating system also affected the degree of trait correspondence because selfing reduces the reliance on pollinators and is analogous to pollination generalization.Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that there are predictable ""winners"" and ""losers"" of evolutionary arms races and the results of this study highlight the fact that breeding system and the degree of specialization can influence the outcome.",10.1186/1471-2148-10-204,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Multiple,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morophological,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = plants and insects, Traits Used = big list of morphometric traits (all in the SI in zotero)",

Ecologists debate the importance of neutral versus niche-based explanations for patterns of species coexistence and whether small-scale data can inform ecological understanding of communities, referred to by McNaughton [Ecological Monographs, 1983, 53, 291] as 'ecology's cruel dilemma.' Research on phylogenetic relationships, traits and species co-occurrence has attempted to address this topic, with results considerably mixed. 2. We address the hypothesis that plant community assembly is influenced by trait similarity across ecological gradients and this affects mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) of species within sites. We analysed specific leaf area (SLA), maximum plant height and phylogenetic relationships among Serengeti grasses, a system ideally suited to study community assembly because of an ecological gradient in which the dominant plant stress shifts from drought to light competition. 3. Phylogenetic community assembly theory predicts that MPD would be lowest (under-dispersed) at dry sites and greatest (over-dispersed) at sites with higher rainfall. Similarly, theory predicts that low soil nutrient concentrations should filter intolerant species, so that MPD is expected to be under-dispersed at infertile, low-elevation sites and over-dispersed at fertile, higher-elevation sites. However, as gradients of rainfall and soil fertility run counter to one another across the Serengeti, it was unclear how this covariation would influence MPD. 4. Surprisingly, traits showed different evolutionary patterns: SLA displayed convergent evolution while maximum plant height displayed Brownian evolution across the phylogeny. As predicted, statistically under-dispersed assemblages occurred at lower rainfall, infertile sites while statistically over-dispersed assemblages occurred at higher rainfall, fertile sites. However, the pattern across all plots was weak, with most plots showing no statistical pattern of MPD. 5. Multivariate analyses using structural equation modelling, which statistically controlled for covariation among environmental effects, revealed complex direct and indirect effects of environmental variation on MPD, including offsetting direct effects of SLA and maximum plant height due to their different patterns of trait evolution. 6. Synthesis. Spatially counteracting gradients of moisture and soil fertility across the Serengeti, combined with contrasting patterns of trait evolution, obscured the relationship between MPD and any single environmental variable. Our study shows that integrating trait and phylogenetic relationships across ecological gradients yields considerable insight into the ecological mechanisms that determine community composition, but that multivariate techniques may be required to appropriately reveal such patterns.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01795.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Serengeti Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,"Traits Used = specific leaf area, max plant height",
"Andersson, K",2005,"Were there pack-hunting canids in the Tertiary, and how can we know?",PALEOBIOLOGY,"Communal hunting allows some modern canids to catch large and powerful prey. As opposed to felids, for example, Recent canids have a limited ability to grapple and subdue prey by using their forelimbs. Instead, they engage in sustained pursuit predation and the success rate during this activity typically increases with the number of individuals participating in the hunt. Clearly, such behaviors do not fossilize directly and have to be inferred from anatomy. This paper focuses on how social pack-hunting in large-bodied fossil canids can be determined and the potential for it among Tertiary canids (Canidae, Carnivora). Craniodental adaptations for handling and killing large prey and forearm utility in running and grappling are investigated by principal components and canonical variates analyses. I also test whether fossil canids responded to predation of large prey by evolving the same morphological traits as their Recent pursuit-type relatives. The analyses show that small and large members of the Recent Caninae share similar craniodental morphologies. However, the same pattern is not present in the fossil subfamilies Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. In the latter, large representatives are characterized by being relatively short-faced with reduced anterior premolars and enlarged posterior premolars, thus approaching a ""pantherine-like"" configuration. These traits are interpreted as an adaptation for killing prey with felid-like canine bites. The elbow joints of large canids also do not converge on a single morpho-type. All analyzed species of borophagines and hesperocyonines have retained the ability to supinate their forearms, unlike Recent large Caninae. It is therefore likely that manual manipulation was part of their hunting behavior, thus removing an essential part of the argument for social packhunting in these forms, as the benefits of such a strategy become less obvious. An association between the origin of pack-pursuit ""wolf avatars"" and the origin and evolution of grass-dominated ecosystems is hypothesized. The results presented here clearly suggest that Recent large canids are poor ecological, morphological, and behavioral analogs for their large fossil relatives.",10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031<0056:WTPCIT>2.0.CO;2,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Mammals,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,"I coded this as relevant even though it focuses on extinct species because it still references and uses data about extant organisms and connects the traits discussed to predation behaviours, and as such I think it's relevant",

Understanding species’ abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading‐edge range shifts and species’ traits.

However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management.

In this study, we investigated the capacity of large African mammal species to provide the cultural ecosystem service of wildlife tourism by using a supply and demand framework. First, we tested the relationship between supply and demand for large mammal species in wildlife tourism. Second, we tested whether the trophic level and body size of mammals influenced the mismatch between supply and demand, and whether the patterns of mismatches were consistent among four protected areas (PAs) in three Southern African countries. To quantify supply of species, we counted large mammals along 196 five km road transects within the four PAs; to estimate demand, we gathered 651 face-to-face questionnaires of wildlife tourists and distinguished between their expectation and hope to see specific species. Results show that a higher supply of large mammal species increased the expectation to see a species (linear regression slope beta = 0.28, p < 0.01), whereas supply did not affect the hopes to see a specific species (beta = -0.04, p = 0.63). Analyses of mismatches revealed that predator species were more demanded in relation to their supply than ungulates. Finally, we found that the demands of wildlife tourists for mammal species in relation to their supply were consistent across the four PAs. Supply-demand analyses reveal that species traits, in particular trophic level, shape the hopes of wildlife tourists to see specific mammal species. We propose that the quantification of supply-demand mismatches can be used to identify charismatic species and relevant species traits, and can be applied for wildlife tourism assessments within as well as across regions. Supply-demand analyses provide a useful framework and deliver indicators for better assessing cultural ecosystem services involving wildlife and nature-based tourism, and can be used for conservation management.

The evolution of habitat selection behaviour in these species is thus expected to be influenced by multiple and possibly contrasting selective forces.

First, we demonstrated genetic variation for sediment browsing among D. magna genotypes from natural populations sampled across a broad geographic range.

Chronically low resource availability is predicted to favour the evolution of slow growth, whereas attaining a size-refuge from mortality risk is predicted to favour the evolution of rapid growth. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) evolve differences in behaviour, morphology and life-history traits in response to predation, thus demonstrating that predators are potent agents of selection. Predators in low-predation environments prey preferentially on small guppies, but those in high-predation environments appear to be non-selective. Because guppies can outgrow their main predator in low- but not high-predation localities, we predict that predation will select for higher growth rates in the low-predation environments. However, low-predation localities also tend to have lower productivity than high-predation localities, yielding the prediction that guppies from these sites should have slower growth rates. Here we compare the growth rates of the second laboratory-born generation of guppies from paired high- and low-predation localities from four different drainages. In, two out of four comparisons, guppies from high-predation sites grew significantly faster than their low-predation counterparts. We also compare laboratory born descendants from a field introduction experiment land show that guppies introduced to a low-predation environment evolved slower growth rates after 13 years, although this was evident only at the high food level.

Variation partitioning was used to examine how much variation in ant diversity was explained by environmental and spatial variables. Autocorrelation in diversity measures and each trait's phylogenetic signal were also analyzed. We found strong autocorrelation in diversity measures. Both environmental and spatial variables significantly contributed to variation in TD, PD, and FD at both alpha and beta scales; spatial structure had the larger influence. The different facets of diversity showed similar patterns along environmental gradients. Environment explained a much larger percentage of variation in FD than in TD or PD. All traits demonstrated strong phylogenetic signals. Our results indicate that environmental filtering and dispersal limitations structure all types of diversity in ant communities. Strong dispersal limitations appear to have led to clustering of TD, PD, and FD in western and central Europe, probably because different historical and evolutionary processes generated different pools of species. Remarkably, these three facets of diversity showed parallel patterns along environmental gradients. Trait-mediated species sorting and niche conservatism appear to structure ant diversity, as evidenced by the fact that more variation was explained for FD and that all traits had strong phylogenetic signals.

Prey may select multiple habitats whereby different genotypes prefer different habitats. If the predator is also habitat-specific the prey may evolve different habitat occupancy. Drastic changes can occur in the relation of the predator to the evolved prey. Fisheries exert powerful predation and can be a potent evolutionary force. Fisheries-induced selection can lead to phenotypic changes that influence the collapse and recovery of the fishery. However, heritability of the phenotypic traits involved and selection intensities are low suggesting that fisheries-induced evolution occurs at moderate rates at decadal time scales. The Pantophysin I (Pan I) locus in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), representing an ancient balanced polymorphism predating the split of cod and its sister species, is under an unusual mix of balancing and directional selection including current selective sweeps. Here we show that Pan I alleles are highly correlated with depth with a gradient of 0.44% allele frequency change per meter. AA fish are shallow-water and BB deep-water adapted in accordance with behavioral studies using data storage tags showing habitat selection by Pan I genotype. AB fish are somewhat intermediate although closer to AA. Furthermore, using a sampling design covering space and time we detect intense habitat-specific fisheries-induced selection against the shallow-water adapted fish with an average 8% allele frequency change per year within year class. Genotypic fitness estimates (0.08, 0.27, 1.00 of AA, AB, and BB respectively) predict rapid disappearance of shallow-water adapted fish. Ecological and evolutionary time scales, therefore, are congruent. We hypothesize a potential collapse of the fishery. We find that probabilistic maturation reaction norms for Atlantic cod at Iceland show declining length and age at maturing comparable to changes that preceded the collapse of northern cod at Newfoundland, further supporting the hypothesis. We speculate that immediate establishment of large no-take reserves may help avert collapse.",10.1371/journal.pone.0005529,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival; reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years.

Ontogenetic reaction norms, in contrast, describe how phenotypes unfold during growth in different environments. We studied the ontogenetic reaction norms of the morphological shape of a series of defensive abdominal spines in dragonfly larvae, both in the laboratory and in a number of natural populations. In a laboratory rearing experiment, we demonstrated that these spines grew more solid and elongated when waterborne environmental cues of fish predators were present: this is evidence of phenotypic plasticity in defensive spine morphology. The ontogenetic reaction norms of defensive spines were also found to differ in natural populations with and without fish. A detailed analysis of the growth trajectories showed that this differentiation was primarily due to ontogenetic acceleration in environments with fish, leading to relatively exaggerated spine shape in these environments. However, while the ontogenetic trajectories of shape in some spines diverged at the onset of ontogeny in the two environments, those of others remained parallel until a given phase of ontogeny. Hence, the timing of the developmental divergence of these phenotypically integrated traits differed, suggesting differences in the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our results illustrate that a conceptual integration of environmental and ontogenetic approaches to the study of phenotypic differentiation can significantly promote our understanding of the ecology and evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.",10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1847:ORNOPI]2.0.CO;2,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Closely related species usually share more phenotypic features than distant ones, but close relatives do not necessarily have the same ecologies. Rodents are the most diverse group of living mammals, with impressive ecomorphological diversification. We used museum collections and ecological literature to gather data on morphology, diet and locomotion for 208 species of rodents from different bioregions to investigate how morphological similarity and phylogenetic relatedness are associated with ecology. After considering differences in body size and shared evolutionary history, we find that unrelated species with similar ecologies can be characterized by a well-defined suite of morphological features. Our results validate the hypothesized ecological relevance of the chosen traits. These cranial, dental and external (e.g. ears) characters predicted diet and locomotion and showed consistent differences among species with different feeding and substrate use strategies.

The relative importance of competition and predation will depend largely on the local assemblage of species, the type of predators, or the degree of niche segregation. We experimentally investigated the interplay of competition and predation on the structure and trophic level (measured via stable isotope analysis) of a seven-species Neotropical freshwater guild using a mesocosm approach in central Panama. We tested the effect of two types of predators (dragonfly nymphs or adult water bugs) in combination with the presence/absence of a common competitor, the red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas), on four core species of tadpoles. We also distinguished between consumptive and non-consumptive effects of each type of predator by presenting them to tadpoles caged or freely roaming. Dragonfly larvae were more efficient predators than water bugs, but these effects were not uniform for all tadpole species. All amphibian species grew bigger when raised in the presence of an uncaged dragonfly nymph, presumably due to reduced competition through thinning, but tadpoles were smaller when exposed to caged dragonfly nymphs indicating the existence of non-consumptive predator effects as well. Predator presence also altered the relative trophic position of the different amphibian species, causing some tadpole species to increase and others to decrease their trophic status. Despite the presumed ecological similarity of tadpole species in the guild, the interplay of competition and predation had varying effects on the trophic status of nearly every species. Our results indicate that community composition can greatly affect the trophic level of larval amphibians, and that predation may have a greater role than competition in structuring Neotropical larval amphibian guilds.",10.3389/fevo.2018.00028,N,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Freshwater,Multiple,River,0,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,1,0,,"Started coding this one, but then thought that actually none of the traits they're using are truly related to environmental filtering.

We tested the hypothesis that the functional diversity of the testate amoebae would be lower than randomly expected in the hydrological periods, influenced by environmental filters. In addition, the functional diversity of the testate amoebae was expected to be strongly influenced by variables related to the productivity of the environments, since the food resources are the most important environmental factors in the assembly of testate amoeba communities. Sampling was carried out quarterly between 2002 and 2011 on the surface of the pelagic zone in six floodplain environments. Results showed that the values were lower than randomly expected according to the functional diversity indices.

Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems - and thereby degrade the properties and ecological services most valued by humans - environmental flows' left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and rehabilitation / restoration depends upon understanding and accurately modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and flood-plains. 3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental flow standards at multiple spatial scales - applicable to all rivers in any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks; and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA). 4.

Species can assemble into communities either randomly or due to deterministic processes. Deterministic assembly leads to species being more similar (underdispersed) or more different (overdispersed) in certain traits than would be expected by chance. However, the relative importance of those processes is not well understood for many organisms, including terrestrial invertebrates. Based on knowledge of a broad range of species traits, we tested for the presence of trait underdispersion (indicating dispersal or environmental filtering) and trait overdispersion (indicating niche partitioning) and their relative importance in explaining land snail community composition on lake islands. The analysis of community assembly was performed using a functional diversity index (Rao's quadratic entropy) in combination with a null model approach. Regression analysis with the effect sizes of the assembly tests and environmental variables gave information on the strength of under- and overdispersion along environmental gradients. Additionally, we examined the link between community weighted mean trait values and environmental variables using a CWM-RDA. We found both trait underdispersion and trait overdispersion, but underdispersion (eight traits) was more frequently detected than overdispersion (two traits). Underdispersion was related to four environmental variables (tree cover, habitat diversity, productivity of ground vegetation, and location on an esker ridge). Our results show clear evidence for underdispersion in traits driven by environmental filtering, but no clear evidence for dispersal filtering. We did not find evidence for overdispersion of traits due to diet or body size, but overdispersion in shell shape may indicate niche differentiation between snail species driven by small-scale habitat heterogeneity.

ResultsSpecies traits explained more of the variance in community composition than species identity. Snail traits such as tolerance to environmental stress (related to soil moisture content) and niche width were correlated with the main environmental gradient.

The dispersal success of animals depends on the biophysical structure of their environments and their biological traits; however, comparatively little is known about how evolutionary trade-offs among suites of biological traits affect dispersal potential. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based simulation model to evaluate the influence of trade-offs among a suite of biological traits on the dispersal success of vagile animals in fragmented landscapes. We specifically chose traits known to influence dispersal success: speed of movement, perceptual range, risk of predation, need to forage during dispersal, and amount of suitable habitat required for successful settlement in a patch. Using the metric of relative dispersal success rate, we assessed how the costs and benefits of evolutionary investment in these biological traits varied with landscape structure. In heterogeneous environments with low habitat availability and scattered habitat patches, individuals with more equal allocation across the trait spectrum dispersed most successfully. Our analyses suggest that the dispersal success of animals in heterogeneous environments is highly dependent on hierarchical interactions between trait trade-offs and the geometric configurations of the habitat patches in the landscapes through which they disperse. In an applied sense, our results indicate potential for ecological mis-alignment between species' evolved suites of dispersal-related traits and altered environmental conditions as a result of rapid global change.

Using the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a highly social species, we tested for non-random social associations among males in mixedsex groups based on two phenotypic traits (body length and coloration) that predict relative sexual attractiveness to females and sexual (sperm) competitiveness. Based on a well-replicated laboratory dichotomous-choice test of social group preference, we could not reject the null hypothesis that focal males chose randomly between a mixed-sex group that comprised a female and a rival male that was less sexually attractive than themselves and another mixed-sex group containing a sexually more attractive male. The same conclusion was reached when females were absent from the two groups. As might be expected from these laboratory findings, free-ranging males in the field were not assorted by either body length or colour in mixed-sex shoals. The apparent lack of an evolved and expressed preference in wild male guppies from our study population to form social associations with other males based on their relative sexual attractiveness and competitiveness might be due to the fission-fusion dynamics of guppy shoals in nature.

Our objectives were to determine whether maternal nutrition or predation were determinants of nesting success and female survival. We captured and radio-marked 43 females at four leks in natural, unfragmented prairie during a 4-year study. Reproductive potential was high because females laid large clutches (10.9 +/- 0.3 eggs, n = 24), renested following clutch loss (22.2%, n = 27 females), and had high egg viability (88.6 +/- 5.0% of eggs hatched; n = 7 nests), but reproductive traits were not correlated with female morphometrics (mass, or tarsus and keel lengths). Daily survival rate of nests was low (0.928, n = 34 nests) resulting in a predicted nest success rate of 7.4% for a 35-day exposure period. We used known fate models to estimate weekly survival from telemetry data for 40 females. Weekly survival was 0.970 and the extrapolated survival rate for the 6-month breeding season was 45.7%.

Survival of females was 1.6 to 2.0 times higher during the nonbreeding season than the breeding season, presumably because females are susceptible to predation during incubation and broodrearing.

It remains, however, largely unclear how above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery of species-rich tropical forests is affected by disturbance intensity and post-disturbance (remaining) tree-community attributes, following logging and thinning interventions. We investigated whether annual AGB increment (DeltaAGB) decreases with management-related disturbance intensity (disturbance hypothesis), and increases with the diversity (niche-complementarity hypothesis) and the community-weighted mean (CWM) of acquisitive traits of dominant species (biomass-ratio hypothesis) in the remaining tree community. We analysed data from a long-term forest-management experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over two recovery periods: post-logging (1983-1989) and post-thinning (1995-2012). We computed the DeltaAGB of surviving trees, recruit trees and of the total tree community. Disturbance intensity was quantified as basal area reduction and basal area remaining. Remaining diversity (taxonomic, functional and structural) and CWM of five functional traits linked to biomass productivity (specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorous concentration, leaf toughness and wood density) were calculated for the post-intervention inventories. Predictors were related to response variables using multiple linear regressions and structural equation modelling. We found support for the disturbance hypothesis in both recovery periods. AGB increment of survivors and of the total tree community increased with basal area remaining, indicating the importance of remaining growing stock for biomass recovery. Conversely, AGB increment of recruit trees increased with basal area reduction because changes in forest structure increased resource availability for young trees. We did not find consistent support for the niche-complementarity and biomass-ratio hypotheses, possibly because of a high redundancy in these extremely species-rich forests. Synthesis and applications. The intensity of disturbance through management, expressed as basal area reduction and basal area remaining, was consistently more important for explaining forest biomass recovery following harvesting and thinning than remaining diversity or trait composition. This points to the importance of controlling logging and thinning intensity in forests of the eastern Amazon. Given the high intervention intensities applied in this experiment, it is likely that low to moderate harvesting intensities permitted by the current legislation for the Brazilian Amazon (30 m3/ha) will not impair biomass recovery in these forests.",10.1111/1365-2664.13134,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,,"Traits used = specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, leaf toughness, and wood density",

Mean seed size was modelled as a function of mean annual temperature and grazing pressure. According to this model, warmer and less-grazed communities tend to show a smaller mean seed size.

Those invaders that established abundant populations tended to be added outside or at the margins of the receiving morphospace, whereas non-indigenous species morphologically simi- lar to resident ones failed to develop large populations or even to establish themselves, probably because the available ecological niches were already occupied.

Here, we assessed the resilience of a forest ecosystem to an overabundant herbivore population by assessing changes in 19 functional traits for plant, 13 traits for ground beetle and 16 traits for songbird communities after six years of controlled browsing on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada). Our results indicated that plants were more responsive to 6 years of reduced browsing pressure than ground beetles and songbirds. However, co-inertia analysis revealed that ground beetle communities responded in a similar way than plant communities with stronger relationships between plant and ground beetle traits at reduced deer density, a pattern not detected between plant and songbird. High deer density favored plants species that reproduce vegetatively and with abiotic pollination and seed dispersal, traits implying little interaction with animal. On the other hand, traits found at reduced deer density mostly involved trophic interaction. For example, plants in this treatment had fleshy fruits and large seeds dispersed by birds or other animals whereas ground beetle species were carnivorous. Overall, our results suggest that plant communities recovered some functional components to overabundant herbivore populations, since most traits associated with undisturbed forests were reestablished after six years of deer reduction.

Habitat patches that have been completely cleared of their original vegetation historically and subsequently recolonized naturally provide a useful study system to explore the importance of the processes involved in community assembly. Forests where the understorey vegetation is recovering from past agricultural land use form an iconic example of such a system. 2. The colonization capacity of forest plant species into post-agricultural forests has been related to dispersal traits in previous comparative analyses, demonstrating the significance of dispersal limitation. Yet, none of them has evaluated evidence for a phylogenetic signal in colonization capacity and, thus, explored the possibility that the dispersal traits are correlated with unmeasured establishment-related traits that are also shared through common ancestry. 3. Here, we analysed the colonization capacity of 330 species into post-agricultural forests across seven different landscapes in Europe and North America. With phylogenetic meta-analysis models, we quantified the phylogenetic signal in colonization capacity and tested whether the colonization dispersal trait relationships are confounded by phylogenetic non-independence. 4. Closely related forest understorey species were more similar to one another in terms of their capacity to colonize post-agricultural forests than were more distantly related species. The correlations between dispersal traits and colonization were not independent from phylogeny. While we found some evidence of phylogenetic clustering of species' frequencies in post-agricultural communities, this was apparently not a result of strong filtering on dispersal traits. 5.

"Balasubramaniam, P; Rotenberry, JT",2016,Elevation and latitude interact to drive life-history variation in precocial birds: a comparative analysis using galliformes,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. Elevational gradients provide a powerful laboratory for understanding the environmental and ecological drivers of geographic variation in avian life-history strategies. Environmental variation across elevational gradients is hypothesized to select for a trade-off of reduced fecundity (lower clutch size and/or fewer broods) for higher offspring quality (larger eggs and/or increased parental care) in higher elevation species and populations. In birds, a focus on altricial species from north temperate latitudes has prevented an evaluation of the generality of this trade-off, and how it is affected by latitude and intrinsic factors (development mode). 2. We performed a comparative analysis controlling for body size and phylogenetic relationships on a global data set of 135 galliform species to test (i) whether higher elevation precocial species have lower fecundity (smaller clutch and/or fewer broods) and invest more in offspring quality (greater egg mass) and (ii) whether latitude influences the traits involved and/or the trade-off, and (iii) to identify ecological and environmental drivers of life-history variation along elevational gradients. 3. Life-history traits showed significant interaction effects across elevation and latitude: temperate higher elevation species had smaller clutches and clutch mass, larger eggs and shorter incubation periods, whereas more tropical species had larger clutches, eggs and clutch mass, and longer incubation periods as elevation increased. Number of broods and body mass did not vary with elevation or latitude. Latitudinal gradient in clutch size was observed only for low-elevation species. 4. Significantly, an overlooked latitude-by-elevation interaction confounds our traditional view of clutch size variation across a tropical-to-temperate gradient. Across all latitudes, higher elevation species invested in offspring quality via larger eggs but support for reduced fecundity resulting from smaller clutches was found only along temperate elevational gradients; contrary to expectations, tropical high-elevation species showed increased fecundity. Variation in nest predation risk could explain differences between temperate and tropical elevational gradients, but we lack a consistent mechanism to explain why predation risk should vary in this manner. Alternatively, a resource availability hypothesis based on physical attributes that globally differ between elevation and latitude (seasonality in day length and temperature) seems more plausible.",10.1111/1365-2656.12570,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,,"Traits Used = clutch size, number of broods, egg size, parental care.

We studied a tri-trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource (Serratia fonticola), (ii) an intermediate consumer (Paramecium caudatum), (iii) a top predator (Didinium nasutum) and (iv) a parasite of the intermediate consumer (Holospora undulata). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host (Paramecium) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate consumer (Paramecium), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource (Serratia). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non-additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density-mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in Didinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with Serratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected Paramecium.

Niche theory proposes that species differences underlie both coexistence within communities and the differentiation in species composition among communities via limiting similarity and environmental filtering. However, it has been difficult to extend niche theory to species-rich communities because of the empirical challenge of quantifying niches for many species. This has motivated the development of functional and phylogeny-based approaches in community ecology, which represent two different means of approximating niche attributes.2. Here, we assess the utility of plant functional traits and phylogenetic relationships in predicting community assembly processes using the largest trait and phylogenetic data base to date for any set of species-rich communities.3. We measured 17 functional traits for all 4672 individuals of 668 tree species co-occurring in nine tropical rain forest plots in French Guiana.

We also generated a dated molecular phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequencing of two plastid loci (rbcL and matK) comprising 97% of the individuals and 91% of the species in the plots.5. We found that, on average, co-occurring species had greater functional and, to a lesser extent, phylogenetic similarity than expected by chance.6. We also found that functional traits and their ordination loadings showed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic distance provides pertinent information on niche overlap in tropical tree communities.7.

We test how body size, snout length and bathymetric distribution influence the feeding habits and dietary niche breadth in skates using data on 71 species taken from the literature. We hypothesized that snout length has an effect on diet composition. We also hypothesized that dietary niche breadth increases with increasing depth range and decreases with increasing body size of skate species. Generalized additive models for location scale and shape were fitted with taxonomic level (genera nested within family) included as a random effect term in each model. A model selection approach to test the level of support for alternative models was applied. We found that skate species that forage on large prey have the largest body size and skate species with the smallest body size prey on small and medium-sized invertebrates. The results indicated that body size has an effect on feeding habits of skates, whereas an effect of snout length was not supported. Bathymetric variables have an effect on the diet of skates.

Demic diffusion of farming and languages from the Near East should have determined dines in areas defined by linguistic criteria; the alternative hypothesis of cultural transmission does not predict dines. Spatial autocorrelation analysis shows significant gradients in three of the four linguistic families supposedly affected by neolithic demic diffusion; the Afroasiatic family is the exception. Many such gradients are not observed when populations are jointly analyzed, regardless of linguistic classification. This is incompatible with the hypothesis that major cultural transformations in Eurasia (diffusion of related languages and spread of agriculture) took place without major demographic changes. The model of demic diffusion seems therefore to provide a mechanism explaining coevolution of linguistic and biological traits in much of the Old World, Archaeological, linguistic, and genetic evidence agree in suggesting a multidirectional process of gene flow from the Near East in the neolithic. However, the possibility should be envisaged that some allele frequency patterns can predate the neolithic and depend on the initial spread of Homo sapiens sapiens from Africa into Eurasia.

Our analyses revealed clear population genomic structure of potential source populations in Eurasia, including deep differentiation of a lineage found in the southern Apennine and Balkan Peninsulas and divergence among populations in Asia, eastern Europe and western Europe. We found strongest support for an evolutionary scenario in which western European populations were derived from an ancient admixture event between populations from eastern Europe and Asia, and subsequently served as the main genetic bridgehead' for introductions to the Americas.

We predicted that the growth rate of cowbirds would be most strongly related to the abundance of forest insectivorous hosts and that landscape fragmentation would have opposite effects on the parasite and its hosts. Furthermore, due to the species' sedentarity and low rates of adult dispersal, we expected that cowbird population dynamics would be structured at local, rather than large spatial scales. LocationThe Great Plains, United States. MethodsWe modelled jointly the population dynamics of cowbird and its 58 most common hosts, accounting for effects of landscape fragmentation and cowbird dispersal. We used Bayesian inference to evaluate this model on 76 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), surveyed each year from 2001 to 2011. We then analysed covariations between the demographic dynamics of cowbirds and their hosts in a multivariate ecological trait space. ResultsContrary to most of its hosts, the cowbird had positive growth rates in man-disturbed, fragmented landscapes, which covaried at small spatial scales. The large-scale effects of parasitism were limited, as few host species affected, or were affected by cowbird growth rates. However, significant cowbird-host relationships were structured by ecological traits: cowbird growth rates were most increased by the abundance of ecological generalists, while hosts were affected by cowbird abundance irrespective of their position in the functional space. Main conclusionsCowbirds parasitize opportunistically the hosts occurring in disturbed landscapes. The large-scale effects of nest parasitism therefore depend probably on landscape structure and other environmental factors operating at local scales.

We derive an approximate deterministic population dynamics model keeping track of spatial structure, via spatial moment equations, from an individual-based spatial consumer-resource model; where space-use of consumers resembles that of central place foragers. Using invasion analyses, we investigate how the evolutionarily stable home range size of the consumer depends on a number of ecological and behavioral traits of both the resource and the consumer. We show that any trait variation leading to a decreased overall resource production or an increased spatial segregation between consumer and resource acts to increase consumer home range size. In this way, we extend theoretical predictions on optimal territory size to a larger range of ecological scenarios where home ranges overlap and population dynamics feedbacks are possible. Consideration of spatial traits such as dispersal distances also generates new results: (1) consumer home range size decreases with increased resource dispersal distance, and (2) when consumer agonistic behavior is weak, more philopatric consumers have larger home ranges. Finally, our results emphasize the role of the spatial correlation between consumer and resource distributions in determining home range size, and suggest resource dispersion is less important.",10.1007/s12080-011-0148-7,Y,0,0,0,0,0,0,T Model,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,1,"Morophological, Behavioural",2,1,0,0,,,1,T,1,0,0,0,1,,"Traits Used = attack efficiency, resource productivity, resource density independent death rate, resource competition strength, consumer density independent death rate, consumer competition strength, resource dispersal rate, sonsumer dispersal rate, resource dispersal range, resource competition range, attack range, consumer dispersal range, consumer competition range, consumer conversion efficiency",

It can even select for constancy in key life-history traits, though some exceptions are known. Changes in the level of environmental variability are therefore important to predict population growth or life-history evolution. Recently, several cyclic vole and lemming populations have shown large dynamical changes that might affect the demography or life-histories of rodent predators. Skuas constitute an important case study among rodent predators, because of their strongly saturating breeding productivity (they lay only two eggs) and high degree of site fidelity, in which they differ from nomadic predators raising large broods in good rodent years. This suggests that they cannot capitalize on lemming peaks to the same extent as nomadic predators and might be more vulnerable to collapses of rodent cycles. We develop a model for the population dynamics of long-tailed skuas feeding on lemmings to assess the demographic consequences of such variable and non-stationary prey dynamics, based on data collected in NE Greenland. The model shows that populations of long-tailed skua sustain well changes in lemming dynamics, including temporary collapses (e.g. 10years). A high floater-to-breeder ratio emerges from rigid territorial behaviour and a long-life expectancy, which buffers the impact of adult abundance's decrease on the population reproductive output. The size of the floater compartment is affected by changes in both mean and coefficient of variation of lemming densities (but not cycle amplitude and periodicity per se). In Greenland, the average lemming density is below the threshold density required for successful breeding (including during normally cyclic periods). Due to Jensen's inequality, skuas therefore benefit from lemming variability; a positive effect of environmental variation. Long-tailed skua populations are strongly adapted to fluctuating lemming populations, an instance of demographic lability in the reproduction rate. They are also little affected by poor lemming periods, if there are enough floaters, or juveniles disperse to neighbouring populations. The status of Greenland skua populations therefore strongly depends upon floater numbers and juvenile movements, which are not known. This reveals a need to intensify colour-ringing efforts on the long-tailed skua at a circumpolar scale.",10.1111/1365-2656.12140,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

The rapid diversification of G. aculeatus in post-glacial freshwater environments, combined with recently developed molecular tools, provides a unique opportunity to study the functional basis of fitness variation in natural populations. In derived freshwater populations, a number of morphological traits have diverged in parallel from the marine ancestral state, including the number of lateral armour plates. Evolution of reduced armour in freshwater populations is due to positive selection from both abiotic and biotic mechanisms. The major effect gene (ectodysplasin-A or Eda), along with several minor effect genetic regions, has recently been shown to control lateral plate variation.

Like other domain-oriented Vis symposia, this symposium's purpose was to explore the unique characteristics and requirements of visualization within the domain, and to enhance both the Visualization and Bio/Life-Sciences communities by pushing Biological data sets and domain understanding into the Visualization community, and well-informed Visualization solutions back to the Biological community. Amongst several other activities, the BioVis symposium created a data analysis and visualization contest. Unlike many contests in other venues, where the purpose is primarily to allow entrants to demonstrate tour-de-force programming skills on sample problems with known solutions, the BioVis contest was intended to whet the participants' appetites for a tremendously challenging biological domain, and simultaneously produce viable tools for a biological grand challenge domain with no extant solutions. For this purpose expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) data analysis was selected. In the BioVis 2011 contest, we provided contestants with a synthetic eQTL data set containing real biological variation, as well as a spiked-in gene expression interaction network influenced by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA variation and a hypothetical disease model. Contestants were asked to elucidate the pattern of SNPs and interactions that predicted an individual's disease state. 9 teams competed in the contest using a mixture of methods, some analytical and others through visual exploratory methods. Independent panels of visualization and biological experts judged entries. Awards were given for each panel's favorite entry, and an overall best entry agreed upon by both panels. Three special mention awards were given for particularly innovative and useful aspects of those entries. And further recognition was given to entries that correctly answered a bonus question about how a proposed ""gene therapy"" change to a SNP might change an individual's disease status, which served as a calibration for each approaches' applicability to a typical domain question. In the future, BioVis will continue the data analysis and visualization contest, maintaining the philosophy of providing new challenging questions in open-ended and dramatically underserved Bio/Life Sciences domains.",10.1186/1471-2105-13-S8-S8,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

This framework proposes that species traits will explain how different species respond to disturbance (i.e. response traits) as well as their contribution to ecosystem function (i.e. effect traits). However, predictive response and effect traits remain elusive for most systems. Here, we use data on crop pollination services provided by native, wild bees to explore the role of six commonly used species traits in determining both species' response to land-use change and the subsequent effect on crop pollination. Analyses were conducted in parallel for three crop systems (watermelon, cranberry, and blueberry) located within the same geographical region (mid-Atlantic USA). Bee species traits did not strongly predict species' response to land-use change, and the few traits that were weakly predictive were not consistent across crops. Similarly, no trait predicted species' overall functional contribution in any of the three crop systems, although body size was a good predictor of per capita efficiency in two systems. Overall we were unable to make generalizable predictions regarding species responses to land-use change and its effect on the delivery of crop pollination services. Pollinator traits may be useful for understanding ecological processes in some systems, but thus far the promise of traits-based ecology has yet to be fulfilled for pollination ecology.",10.1111/oik.04507,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = sociality (solitary, facultative social, eusocial), nesting placement, brood parasitism, body size, diet breadth, tongue length.

"Baskett, ML",2012,Integrating mechanistic organism-environment interactions into the basic theory of community and evolutionary ecology,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"This paper presents an overview of how mechanistic knowledge of organism-environment interactions, including biomechanical interactions of heat, mass and momentum transfer, can be integrated into basic theoretical population biology through mechanistic functional responses that quantitatively describe how organisms respond to their physical environment. Integrating such functional responses into simple community and microevolutionary models allows scaling up of the organism-level understanding from biomechanics both ecologically and temporally. For community models, Holling-type functional responses for predator-prey interactions provide a classic example of the functional response affecting qualitative model dynamics, and recent efforts are expanding analogous models to incorporate environmental influences such as temperature. For evolutionary models, mechanistic functional responses dependent on the environment can serve as fitness functions in both quantitative genetic and game theoretic frameworks, especially those concerning function-valued traits. I present a novel comparison of a mechanistic fitness function based on thermal performance curves to a commonly used generic fitness function, which quantitatively differ in their predictions for response to environmental change. A variety of examples illustrate how mechanistic functional responses enhance model connections to biologically relevant traits and processes as well as environmental conditions and therefore have the potential to link theoretical and empirical studies. Sensitivity analysis of such models can provide biologically relevant insight into which parameters and processes are important to community and evolutionary responses to environmental change such as climate change, which can inform conservation management aimed at protecting response capacity. Overall, the distillation of detailed knowledge or organism-environment interactions into mechanistic functional responses in simple population biology models provides a framework for integrating biomechanics and ecology that allows both tractability and generality.",10.1242/jeb.059022,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,"Cool paper, but said no because it doesn't actually talk about the traits themselves, its more about how to incorporate traits into functional responses in models, and doesn't actually link variation in trait values to variation in environmental filtering/usage",

Combining them allows an integrated view of processes structuring communities. The North Adriatic Karst is covered by species-rich grasslands, but land abandonment has resulted in replacement by woodlands. This creates a successional gradient along which environmental conditions may change, and different community assembly rules may apply. We sampled 56 plant communities in the Karst and used functional-phylogenetic distances to assess assembly along a successional gradient, from grasslands to shrublands and woodlands. We found 146 species, for which we measured functional traits and built a phylogenetic tree. The three successional stages were floristically different, with grasslands having species that are typical of harsher soil conditions and woodlands with species preferring milder soil conditions. All communities had higher functional than phylogenetic distances, implying that closely related species tended to be phenotypically dissimilar. When more importance was given to functional distances, most grasslands and some shrublands were underdispersed; when more importance was given to phylogenetic distances, only one grassland was underdispersed and one woodland was overdispersed. Combining functional and phylogenetic distances provided us with better estimates of ecological differences in a successional gradient, where environmental filters seem to be the dominant force in early stages and competitive exclusion becomes more important in later stages. Taking into account that sucessional stages are assembled by different rules is essential to predicting their behaviour under future environmental scenarios.",10.1007/s00442-015-3295-5,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,1,0,1,1,"Traits Used = life form, growth form, plant height, spinescence, trichomes, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, scleromorphy, leaf persistence, leaf form, flowering start, flowering length, CSR strategy.

Whether it is generally most advantageous to defend early or late during such encounters is an open theoretical question. We model conditions under which a prey species might evolve early or late defenses in response to predation. Adapting a two-prey, one-predator Rosenzweig-MacArthur system of differential equations, we analyze the effects of modified antipredator defenses (and their associated costs) on the ability of a new prey type to invade the one-prey, one-predator limiting system at equilibrium.

Location: The western Swiss Alps. Methods: Using 912 grassland plots, we constructed predictive models for community-weighted means of plant traits and species richness using HR (25 m) topo-climatic predictors traditionally used in previous modelling studies in this area. In addition, 78 new plots were sampled for evaluation and error assessment in four narrower sets of homogenous conditions based on predictions by the topo-climatic models within two elevational belts (montane and alpine). New, finer-scale predictors were generated from direct field measurements or very high-resolution (VHR; 5m) numerical data. We then used multimodel inference to test the capacity of these finer predictors to explain part of the residual variance in the initial topo-climatic models. Results: We showed that the finer-scale predictors explained up to 44% of theresidual variance in the classical topo-climatic models. The VHR topographic position, soil C/N ratio and pH performed notably well in our analysis. Land use(farming intensity) was highlighted as potentially important in montane grasslands, but improvements were only significant for species richness predictions. Main conclusions: Compared with previously used topo-climatic models, the new, finer-scale predictors significantly improved the prediction of all traits and species richness in alpine plant communities and that of specific leaf area and richness in montane grasslands. The differences in the importance of the predictors, dependent on both trait and position along the elevational gradient, highlight the different factors that shape the distribution of species and communities along elevational gradients.",10.1111/jbi.13129,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,"Traits Used = specific leaf area, vegetative height, seed mass",
"Baudrot, V; Fritsch, C; Perasso, A; Banerjee, M; Raoul, F",2018,Effects of contaminants and trophic cascade regulation on food chain stability: Application to cadmium soil pollution on small mammals - Raptor systems,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Within the current context of global change, ecosystems face simultaneously multiple stressors such as environmental pollution, excessive enrichment, and additional disturbances affecting population dynamics. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies explored the transfer of contaminants by food ingestion between trophic levels, and how contaminant effects on survival and fecundity may change regime shifts of classical predator-prey dynamics. However, the extent to which those contaminants may influence the cascade effect of external stressors, as a change in resources (bottom-up cascade) or a variation in predator abundance (top down cascade) is still poorly understood. We develop a data-driven model to explore how soil contamination modulates the food chain stability and resilience to changes in prey nutrient and in the apex predator mortality rate. We particularly focus on the ecotoxicological impact of the trace metal, cadmium, on a widespread raptor, the barn owl (Tyto alba), feeding on several prey distinct by their trophic positions: herbivores (Microtus spp.), omnivores (wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and bank vole Myodes glareolus) and insectivores (shrews: Crocidura spp. and Sorex spp.). Our model reveals the alternative steady states in population dynamics and the occurrence and position of regime shifts where a subtle change in conditions causes a sudden shift in the ecological system. Based on mathematical modelling and bifurcation analysis, the results show for instance that under toxicity threshold, where no population decline is observed, the contaminant weakens food-chain resilience. Then at higher contamination, the toxic effects on predator releases the top-down control over prey that may increase. This range of chemical stress overturns the paradox of enrichment, a central concept in trophic cascade theory. The transition phase at the highest contamination, where the whole community collapse, exhibits multiple patterns, from smooth to abrupt, depending on external stressors and the prey population. Thus, this work provides a methodology to identify ecological traits of preys that are critical for transferring adverse effects of contaminants across the whole community.",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.05.002,N ,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,1,,,

Here we analysed an elevational gradient in grasslands of the Gran Paradiso National Park (NW Italy) from c. 1,700 to 3,100 m a.s.l. We recorded vascular plant species composition in 13 100-m(2) plots, each with two series of nested subplots from 0.0001 to 10 m(2), as well as a set of environmental parameters (topography, soil). Beta-diversity was assessed via the z-values of power-law species-area relationships, both across all plot sizes and from one plot size to the next bigger one. Diversity-environment relationships were assessed with multi model inference based on Akaike information criterion (AIC), while scale dependence in z-values across plot sizes was analysed with an ANOVA. Life forms and three major functional traits (specific leaf area = SLA, canopy height, seed mass) were derived from trait databases to calculate fractions of life forms and community-weighted means for the metric traits. Species richness on 100 m(2) ranged from 17 to 65, with a mean of 43.5. The z-values were within a typical range known for European grasslands (mean: 0.227), with non-significant scale dependence. The importance of environmental factors for richness changed across grain sizes, with inclination (positive effect), mean soil depth and soil skeleton content (both: negative effect) being most influential at grain sizes of 0.0001-1 m(2). By contrast, soil pH was most important (with a unimodal relationship) for 10 and 100 m(2). After accounting for the other environmental factors, elevation showed a moderate unimodal relationship only for the two largest grain sizes. By contrast, functional composition showed strong and mostly significant relationships with elevation: hemicryptophytes and geophytes became rarer and chamaephytes more frequent, while community-weighted means of SLA, canopy height and seed mass decreased. Our findings highlight the scale dependence of biodiversity patterns, thus pointing to the need of multi-scale sampling to reach comprehensive understanding. Further, we could provide one of the first documentations of biodiversity and functional composition along an elevational gradient in the Alps, some in agreement with expectations, others not.

Its advantages include summarizing information of many species without losing essentials of the main driving processes. Here, we used trait-based approaches to study phytoplankton temporal succession in a subtropical reservoir. We applied a combined approach including morphological traits (i.e. volume, surface) and functional clustering of species (morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and Reynolds' groups) and related the clustering of species with the environment. We found that this reservoir is characterized by a low richness and a bimodal distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Taxonomic and functional classifications were coincident, and the dominant species and groups biomasses were explained by the same group of variables. For instance, group X-2, MBFG V and Carteria sp. biomasses were explained by: pH, Secchi disk depth, N-NH4; while group B, MBFG VI and Cyclotella ocellata biomasses were explained by stability of the water column, incident solar radiation, Secchi disk depth and N-NH4. From our results, we state that functional and taxonomic classifications are complementary rather than opposed approaches, and their specific uses depend exclusively on the aim of the study and the characteristics of the environment under evaluation.

"Beauchamp, G",2002,Higher-level evolution of intraspecific flock-feeding in birds,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Intraspecific flock-feeding occurs in many species of birds but the ecological factors that promote the behavior are not clear. Adaptive hypotheses suggest that such flocking should be more likely in species that are vulnerable to predation due to their smaller size, their preference for more open habitats or their more active foraging mode. In addition, flocking is also thought to be promoted by prey clumpiness because clumps are more easily located by foragers in groups. I examined the relationship between ecological traits and the evolution of flocking at the family taxonomic level among all bird families using a phylogenetic approach. Flocking evolved more often in clades with a preference for clumped prey but also occurred with dispersed prey in groups with kin bonds. The role of predation effects was less clear. The likelihood of flocking actually increased with body mass and failed to correlate with habitat openness in the phylogenetically corrected analysis. Although flocking prevailed in clades with an active foraging mode, all clades with a non-active foraging mode showed a preference for dispersed prey, which on its own could account for the effect of foraging mode. The same effect could explain the relative lack of flocking among clades with nocturnal habits. Flocking occurred to the same extent across habitat types and climate zones. At the family level, the results so far indicate a major role for prey characteristics in the evolution of intraspecific flock-feeding in birds.

Their use has received a growing interest in marine community ecology, for both fundamental and applied purposes. The need of ecological indicators as part of marine directives and conservation programmes has promoted the use of multiple traits for indicator development, but in a questionable context regarding the state of fundamental developments. Biological Trait Analysis (BTA) is a complex research field, characterised by flexible concepts and applications. In order to enhance the development of relevant marine ecological indicators, this review provides baselines for better theoretical and applied BTA. A compilation of the existing literature reveals that specific topics have dominated the use of multiple traits in marine ecology unlike in freshwater and terrestrial ecology where tests of theories and uses of evolutionary concepts consistently preceded BTA applications. Availability of data sets and analytical techniques seemed to have driven the growing use of marine BTA rather than fundamental questions regarding life history theories in marine ecosystem components and the functional nature of traits. It is therefore suggested that greater focus on life history ecology and on the links between marine species traits and ecosystem functioning are still needed to support trait-based indicator development. Life history strategy understanding is put forward as a theoretically-sound basis and fundamental pre-requisite for trait-based marine indicator development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sharks, however, have a variety of feeding and life history strategies and metabolize lipid uniquely. Because of this diversity, and the lipid-association of organochlorines, the dynamics of organochlorine accumulation in sharks may be predicted ineffectively by stable isotope-derived trophic position and body mass, as is typical for other taxa. The present study compared ontogenetic organochlorine profiles in the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), which differ in metabolic thermoregulation and trophic position throughout their ontogeny. Although greater organochlorine concentrations were observed in the larger bodied and higher trophic position white shark (e.g., p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene: 20.2 +/- 2.7ng/g vs 9.3 +/- 2.2ng/g in the dusky shark), slopes of growth-dilution corrected concentrations with age were equal to those of the dusky shark. Similar ontogenetic trophic position increases in both species, less frequent white shark seal predation than previously assumed, or inaccurate species-specific growth parameters are possible explanations. Inshore habitat use (indicated by C-13 values) and mass were important predictors in white and dusky sharks, respectively, of both overall compound profiles and select organochlorine concentrations. The present study clarified understanding of trophic position and body mass as reliable predictors of interspecific organochlorine accumulation in sharks, whereas regional endothermy and diet shifting were shown to have less impact on overall rates of accumulation.

Contingencies of life span with many other morphological, behavioural, and ecological traits are to be expected. We used a data-mining approach, incorporating controls for phylogeny, to uncover broad patterns of trait contingencies in a literature-derived data set of adult life spans for 350 butterfly species. We found that adult feeding habit has strong links with life spans, with pollen-feeders living longer than fruit feeders, which in turn live longer than nectar feeders. Furthermore, traits reducing susceptibility to predators (i.e. aposematism, eye-spots) are associated with longer life. Mud-puddling behaviour as a means of gaining access to minerals, and possibly nitrogen, was generally associated with a short life. We also found strong impacts of the region of occurrence of species (i.e. whether they were tropical or temperate taxa), but received conflicting results depending on whether we analysed field data (longer life in the tropics) or data from caged individuals (shorter life in the tropics). Adult longevity was associated with the growth form of larval host plants (higher on lianas as opposed to herbs, shrubs, or trees), whereas other larval host plant traits did not have strong links with species' life spans. We discuss the hypothetical evolutionary mechanisms explaining those patterns and suggest predictions that could be tested in further research.

"BEISSINGER, SR",1986,"DEMOGRAPHY, ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY, AND THE EVOLUTION OF MATE DESERTION IN THE SNAIL KITE",ECOLOGY,"The Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), an endangered hawk, has a unique mating system in Florida (Beissinger and Snyder 1987): when food is abundant, males or females desert their mates at nearly equal frequency (ambisexual mate desertion) in the midst of a nesting cycle. I examined the demographic and environmental constraints selecting for a clutch size that permits one parent to desert, yet optimizes the number of offspring produced by each parent. Demographic studies, conducted from 1979—1983, indicated that kites have (1) a very high nest failure rate (° = 68%) due most often to unstable nest sites and predation, (2) a variable nesting season (5—10 mo/yr), (3) an early age of first reproduction for a bird this size (10 mo), (4) a high degree of iteroparity (double and potentially triple clutching within a season), and (5) unstable populations. Both nesting success and population size were directly related to Everglades water levels and resultant snail densities. Kites responded to large annual changes in food abundance, not by adjusting clutch size but by deserting their mates and presumably attempting to renest. Kite demographic traits appear to be adaptations to or results of an uncertain environment. Based on 67 yr of Everglades water levels, environmental predictability, measured by spectral analysis and Colwell's (1974) index, was low and influenced by water management regimes: (1) water levels were lowered, (2) annual variation in levels increased and annual cycles became stronger, (3) the period length of long—term drought—flood cycles shifted from 10 or more yr toward 5 yr, and (4) levels became a less predictive cue for favorable nesting conditions. A potential evolutionary pathway from biparental care to mate desertion in Snail Kites is proposed. It is unlikely that mate desertion evolved solely from a context of conflict between the sexes, because kite nesting success is so low that it is probably maladaptive for a parent to desert and jeopardize the survival of any of its first brood. Instead, mate desertion behavior probably evolved in response to a smaller average clutch size; this would allow females to be highly iteroparous and avoid the costs of overinvestment, and should be strongly favored in a highly uncertain environment. Analysis of clutches in museum collections suggests that an apparent decline in clutch size may have occurred in Florida during the past century.

"Bell, DM; Bradford, JB; Lauenroth, WK",2015,Scale dependence of disease impacts on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) mortality in the southwestern United States,ECOLOGY,"Depending on how disease impacts tree exposure to risk, both the prevalence of disease and disease effects on survival may contribute to patterns of mortality risk across a species' range. Disease may accelerate tree species' declines in response to global change factors, such as drought, biotic interactions, such as competition, or functional traits, such as allometry. To assess the role of disease in mediating mortality risk in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), we developed hierarchical Bayesian models for both disease prevalence in live aspen stems and the resulting survival rates of healthy and diseased aspen near the species' southern range limit using 5088 individual trees on 281 United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plots in the southwestern United States. We found that disease prevalence depended primarily on tree size, tree allometry, and spatial variation in precipitation, while mortality depended on tree size, allometry, competition, spatial variation in summer temperature, and both temporal and spatial variation in summer precipitation. Disease prevalence was highest in large trees with low slenderness found on dry sites. For healthy trees, mortality decreased with diameter, slenderness, and temporal variation in summer precipitation, but increased with competition and spatial variation in summer temperature. Mortality of diseased trees decreased with diameter and aspen relative basal area and increased with mean summer temperature and precipitation. Disease infection increased aspen mortality, especially in trees of intermediate size and trees on plots at climatic extremes (i.e., cool, wet and warm, dry climates). By examining variation in disease prevalence, mortality of healthy trees, and mortality of diseased trees, we showed that the role of disease in aspen tree mortality depended on the scale of inference. For variation among individuals in diameter, disease tended to expose intermediate-size trees experiencing moderate risk to greater risk. For spatial variation in summer temperature, disease exposed lower risk populations to greater mortality probabilities, but the magnitude of this exposure depended on summer precipitation. Furthermore, the importance of diameter and slenderness in mediating responses to climate supports the increasing emphasis on trait variation in studies of ecological responses to global change.",10.1890/14-1184.1,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

In Europe, this group includes Araneae, Opiliones, Heteroptera, chrysopids, Forficulina, syrphid larvae, carabids, staphylinids, cantharids and coccinellids. This functional group has no phylogenetic meaning but was created by ecologists as a way of understanding predation, particularly for conservation biological control. We investigated whether trait-based approaches could bring some cohesion and structure to this predator group. A taxonomic hierarchy-based null model was created from taxonomic distances in which a simple Multiplicative relationship described the Linnaean hierarchies (species, genera, etc.) of fifty common aphid predators. Using the same fifty species, a functional groups model was developed using ten behavioural traits (e.g. polyphagy, dispersal, activity, etc.) to describe the way in which aphids were predated in the field. The interrelationships between species were then expressed as dissimilarities within each model and separately analysed using PROXSCAL, a multidimensional scaling (MDS) program. When ordinated using PROXSCAL and then statistically compared using Procrustes analysis, we found that only 17% of information was shared between the two configurations. Polyphagy across kingdoms (i.e. predatory behaviour across animal, plant and fungi kingdoms) and the ability to withstand starvation over days, weeks and months were particularly divisive within the functional groups model. Confirmatory MDS indicated poor prediction of aphid predation rates by the configurations derived from either model. The counterintuitive conclusion was that the inclusion of functional traits, pertinent to the way in which predators fed oil aphids, did not lead to a large improvement in the prediction of predation rate when compared to the standard taxonomic approach.",10.1017/S0007485308005919,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Species interactions in these networks are influenced by the functional traits of the interacting partners, but the generality of trait-based interaction rules and the relationship between functional traits and a species' specialization on specific interaction partners are not yet understood. Here we combine data on eight interaction networks between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds sampled across the tropical and subtropical Andean range. We test which combinations of morphological plant and animal traits determine trait matching between resource and consumer species in these networks. In addition, we test which of the morphological traits influence functional specialization of plant and bird species. In a meta-analysis across network-specific fourth-corner analyses, we found that plant-animal trait pairs related to size matching (fruit size-beak size) and avian foraging behavior (plant height-wing shape and crop mass-body mass) were positively related in these networks. The degree of functional specialization on specific interaction partners was positively related to crop mass in plants and to the pointedness of the wing in birds. Our findings show that morphological trait matching between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds is a general phenomenon in plant-frugivore networks across the Andes and that specific plant and bird traits can be used to approximate the degree of functional specialization.

What remains unknown is the relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed negative correlation between body size and activity level for food-restricted prey - and the absence of a similar response among adequately-fed prey - suggests that a trade-off exists between behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time.",10.1371/journal.pone.0082344,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Freshwater,Multiple,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = amphibeans (frogs) and insects (dragonflies).

However, tests of this assumption are rare and field-based experiments lacking. We tested the relationship between competition, the degree of relatedness, and overdispersion among plants experimentally and using a field survey in a native grassland. Relatedness did not affect competition, nor was competition associated with phylogenetic overdispersion. Further, there was only weak evidence for increased overdispersion at spatial scales where plants are likely to compete. These results challenge traditional theory, but are consistent with recent theories regarding the mechanisms of plant competition and its potential effect on phylogenetic structure.

Most trait-environment studies focus on assemblage-level relationships; yet intraspecific trait variation is important for community, ecosystem, and evolutionary processes, and has substantial implications for these approaches. Assessing population-level trait-environment relationships could test the generality of trait models whilst assessing intraspecific variation. We evaluated the generality of the trilateral life history model (TLHM opportunistic, periodic, and equilibrium endpoints) for fishes - a well-studied trait-environment model at the assemblage level - to populations of three stream fishes in the Midwestern United States in relation to flow regime. The TLHM adequately described major trade-offs in traits amongst populations in all species. Some TLHM flow-based predictions were confirmed, with periodic traits (high fecundity) favoured at sites with greater flow seasonality and lower flow variability in two species, and equilibrium traits (large eggs) in more stable flow conditions in two species. Size at maturity was also inversely related to variability in one species. However, relationships contradicting the TLHM were also found. Coupled with the explanatory power of the TLHM for populations, supporting relationships suggest that synthesizing habitat template models with demographic life history theory could be valuable. Trait-environment models that are well-supported at multiple levels of biological organization could improve understanding of the impacts of environmental change on populations and communities and the valuable ecosystem services that they support.

"Berg, S; Pimenov, A; Palmer, C; Emmerson, M; Jonsson, T",2015,Ecological communities are vulnerable to realistic extinction sequences,OIKOS,"Loss of species will directly change the structure and potentially the dynamics of ecological communities, which in turn may lead to additional species loss (secondary extinctions) due to direct and/or indirect effects (e.g. loss of resources or altered population dynamics). Furthermore, the vulnerability of food webs to repeated species loss is expected to be affected by food web topology, species interactions, as well as the order in which species go extinct. Species traits such as body size, abundance and connectivity might determine a species' vulnerability to extinction and, thus, the order in which species go primarily extinct. Yet, the sequence of primary extinctions, and their effects on the vulnerability of food webs to secondary extinctions, when species abundances are allowed to respond dynamically, has only recently become the focus of attention. Here, we analyse and compare topological and dynamical robustness to secondary extinctions of model food webs, in the face of 34 extinction sequences based on species traits. Although secondary extinctions are frequent in the dynamical approach and rare in the topological approach, topological and dynamical robustness tends to be correlated for many bottom-up directed, but not for top-down directed deletion sequences. Furthermore, removing species based on traits that are strongly positively correlated to the trophic position of species (such as large body size, low abundance, high net effect) is, under the dynamical approach, found to be as destructive as removing primary producers. Such top-down oriented removal of species are often considered to correspond to realistic extinction scenarios, but earlier studies, based on topological approaches, have found such extinction sequences to have only moderate effects on the remaining community. Thus, our result suggests that the structure of ecological communities, and therefore the integrity of important ecosystem processes could be more vulnerable to realistic extinction sequences than previously believed.",10.1111/oik.01279,Y,0,0,0,0,0,0,T Model,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,1,Trait Used = body size.

However, over the past few decades introduced feral cats and dogs started to prey on iguanas on some of the islands. We investigated experimentally whether behavioral and endocrine anti-predator responses changed in response to predator introduction. We hypothesized that flight initiation distances (FID) and corticosterone (CORT) concentrations should increase in affected populations to cope with the novel predators. Populations of marine iguanas reacted differentially to simulated predator approach depending on whether or not they were previously naturally exposed to introduced predators. FIDs were larger at sites with predation than at sites without predation. Furthermore, the occurrence of new predators was associated with increased stress-induced CORT levels in marine iguanas. In addition, age was a strong predictor of variation in FID and CORT levels. Juveniles, which are generally more threatened by predators compared to adults, showed larger FlDs and higher CORT baseline levels as well as higher stress-induced levels than adults. The results demonstrate that this naive island species shows behavioral and physiological plasticity associated with actual predation pressure, a trait that is presumably adaptive. However, the adjustments in FID are not sufficient to cope with the novel predators. We suggest that low behavioral plasticity in the face of introduced predators may drive many island species to extinction. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, it still remains unclear whether heterogeneity may also facilitate coexistence at fine grain sizes or whether other processes, like mass effects and source sink dynamics due to dispersal, control species composition and diversity at these scales. In this study, we used two complimentary analyses to identify the role of heterogeneity within 15 m x 15 m plots for the coexistence of species-rich annual communities in a semi-arid environment along a steep precipitation gradient. Specifically, we: (a) analyzed the effect of environmental heterogeneity on species, functional and phylogenetic diversity within microsites (alpha diversity, 0.06 m(2) and 1 m(2)), across microsites (beta diversity), and diversity at the entire plot (gamma diversity); (b) further we used two null models to detect non-random trait and phylogenetic patterns in order to infer assembly processes, i.e. whether co-occurring species tend to share similar traits (trait convergence) or dissimilar traits (trait divergence). In general, our results showed that heterogeneity had a positive effect on community diversity. Specifically, for alpha diversity, the effect was significant for functional diversity, and not significant for either species or phylogenetic diversities. For beta diversity, all three measures of community diversity (species, functional, and phylogenetic) increased significantly, as they also did for gamma diversity, where functional measures were again stronger than for species or phylogenetic measures. In addition, the null model approach consistently detected trait convergence, indicating that species with similar traits tended to co-occur and had high abundances in a given microsite. While null model analysis across the phylogeny partly supported these trait findings, showing phylogenetic underdispersion at the 1m(2) grain size, surprisingly when species abundances in microsites were analyzed they were more evenly distributed across the phylogenetic tress than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion). In conclusion, our results provide compelling support that environmental heterogeneity at a relatively fine scale is an important factor for species co-existence as it positively affects diversity as well as influences species assembly. Our study underlines the need for trait-based approaches conducted at fine grain sizes in order to better understand species coexistence and community assembly. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The strength of different assembly processes along environmental gradients, such as environmental filtering and functional niche differentiation, can be quantified by analysing trait distributions in communities. While environmental filtering affects species occurrence among communities, functional divergence or convergence is strongly related to species abundances within communities, which few studies have taken into account. We examine the trait-mediated effect of these two processes along a stress-resource gradient. We measured species abundances and the distributions of eight traits related to vegetative and regenerative phases in plant communities along a gradient of soil depth and resource availability in Mediterranean rangelands. We quantified environmental filtering, defined as a local restriction of trait range, and trait divergence, based on abundance-weighted trait variance, using a two-step approach with specifically designed null models. Communities presented a clear functional response to the soil gradient, as evidenced by strong trends in community-weighted trait means. We detected environmental filtering of different traits at both ends of the gradient, suggesting that, contrary to widespread expectations, trait filtering may not necessarily be the result of abiotic filtering under harsh conditions but could likely also result from biotic interactions in productive habitats. We found marked shifts in trait abundance distributions within communities along the gradient. Vegetative traits (e.g. leaf dry matter content) diverged on shallow soils, reflecting the coexistence of distinct water- and nutrient-use strategies in these constrained habitats and converged with increasing soil resource availability. By contrast, regenerative traits (e.g. seed mass) tended to diverge towards deeper soils, while plant reproductive heights diverged all along the gradient. Synthesis: Our study highlights how the combination of abundance data with traits capturing different functional niches is critical to the detection of complex functional responses of plant communities to environmental gradients. We demonstrate that patterns of trait divergence and filtering are strongly contingent on both trait and environment such that there can be no expectation of a simple trend of increasing or decreasing functional divergence along a gradient of resource availability.",10.1111/1365-2745.12003,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf thickness, leaf carbon isotopic ratio, leaf nitrogen concentration, reproductive height, seed mass, onset of flowering date, ",

The role of interactions among zooplankters has thus only occasionally been examined and mainly regarded as secondary or negligible in rivers. This study addresses the question whether and under which conditions biotic interactions within the zooplankton can become the chief drivers of community structure and dynamics in riverine environments. A short-term, high-frequency sampling campaign was performed in the potamal reach of the Po River (Italy). To test for the presence of association patterns among zooplankters, which might be suggestive of potential trophic interactions (predation/competition), taxa were aggregated into functional groups according to their feeding ecology, and time series of their abundances were analysed by means of a variance ratio test, which revealed the occurrence of compensatory dynamics among functional groups under low and stable, although truly advective, discharge conditions. Evidence on the importance of predatorprey interactions and intra-population regulation mechanisms also came from further analyses of the dominant predators gut contents and of the main prey population dynamics. Our results show that, under certain conditions, zooplankton exhibit internal, self-regulatory mechanisms also in the main current of large rivers.

Predators can directly influence disease prevalence via density-mediated effects (e.g., culling infected hosts leading to reduced disease prevalence). However, trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) of predators can also strongly influence disease-but predicting a priori whether TMIEs should increase or decrease disease prevalence can be challenging, especially since a single predator may elicit responses that have opposing effects on disease prevalence. Here, we pair laboratory experiments with a mechanistic, size-based model of TMIEs in a zooplankton host, fungal parasite, multiple predator system. Kairomones can either increase or decrease body size of the host Daphnia, depending on the predator. These changes in size could influence key traits of fungal disease, since infection risk and spore yield increase with body size. For six host genotypes, we measured five traits that determine an index of disease spread (R (0)). Although host size and disease traits did not respond to kairomones produced by the invertebrate predator Chaoborus, cues from fish reduced body size and birth rate of uninfected hosts and spore yield from infected hosts. These results support the size model for fish; the birth and spore yield responses should depress disease spread. However, infection risk did not decrease with fish kairomones, thus contradicting predictions of the size model. Exposure to kairomones increased per spore susceptibility of hosts, countering size-driven decreases in exposure to spores. Consequently, synthesizing among the relevant traits, there was no net effect of fish kairomones on the R (0) metric. This result accentuates the need to integrate the TMIE-based response to predators among all key traits involved in disease spread.",10.1007/s00442-013-2673-0,Y,0,0,1,0,0,1,"T Model, Experiment",Freshwater,Other,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,0,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = daphnia magna, Traits used = birth rate, death rate, feeding rate, body size, per spore susceptibility.

However, the key to interpreting these two types of information is an understanding of the extent to which traits are phylogenetically conserved. In this study, we develop the necessary framework for community phylogenetics approaches in a system of marine crustacean herbivores that play an important role in the ecosystem functioning of seagrass systems worldwide. For 16 species of amphipods and isopods, we (1) reconstructed phylogenetic relationships using COI, 16S, and 18S sequences and Bayesian analyses, (2) measured traits that are potentially important for assembling species between and within habitats, and (3) compared the degree to which each of these traits are evolutionarily conserved. Despite poor phylogenetic resolution for the order Amphipoda as a whole, we resolved almost all of the topology for the species in our system, and used a sampling of ultrametric trees from the posterior distribution to account for remaining uncertainty in topology and branch lengths. We found that traits varied widely in their degree of phylogenetic signal. Body mass, fecundity, and tube building showed very strong phylogenetic signal, and temperature tolerance and feeding traits showed much less. As such, the degree of signal was not predictable based on whether the trait is related to environmental filtering or to resource partitioning. Further, we found that even with strong phylogenetic signal in body size, (which may have large impacts on ecosystem function), the predictive relationship between phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem function is not straightforward. We show that patterns of phylogenetic diversity in communities of seagrass mesograzers could lead to a variety of interpretations and predictions, and that detailed study of trait similarities and differences will be necessary to interpret these patterns.",10.1371/journal.pone.0057550,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,"They do use traits, but they don't actually use the traits to ask any questions, only to see how well they're conserved across phylogenies.

We analysed metacommunity structure and functional trait variation in 148 communities of desmids, freshwater green algae, distributed throughout Europe. We delineated biogeographic modules for both taxa and sites using bipartite network analysis given that the taxa of a module co-occurred more often than expected by chance in sites of the same module. The network analysis distinguished two main acidic and neutral habitats, reflecting environmental filtering, and within each habitat separated species pools with distinct geographic locations, representing a plausible influence of historical biogeography. The geographic differentiation was consistent with a hypothesis of glacial refugia on Atlantic coast. Distance decay in community composition in addition to environmental influence further suggested a role of dispersal limitation. Next, we quantified the variation in cell volume and surface-to-volume of taxa within and among communities, to examine morphological and physiological adaptations of desmids in varying environments. Communities from continental climate contained larger desmids. Conversely, we found a functional convergence of smaller, fast-growing, desmids in oceanic regions.

Results highlighted the presence of a disturbance gradient affecting the species richness and trait-displacement of carabid communities. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps from March to October 2008 at nine randomly selected sample stations; a set of landscape attributes were also collected. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to link the distribution of carabid life-history traits and species richness with the most informative combination of landscape attributes. The first PCA axis (PC1) showed significant correlation with ""distance to the lake shoreline"" and ""perimeter-area ratio"", highlighting the presence of a disturbance-axis. The second and third axes accounted only for a trivial portion of the total variance.

However, the factors shaping interaction patterns among species and, therefore, network structure remain unclear. One potentially important factor is the matching of phenotypic traits. Here, we tested for trait matching in a bird-flower visitation network from New Zealand. We first quantified the overall network structure and tested whether flower size could account for differences in the visitation rates of flowering plants. We then explored the relationship between the flower size and bill size. The results showed that the interaction network is nested. Plant species with large flowers received more visits from birds than plant species with small flowers. Moreover, plant species with large flowers were visited more frequently by birds with large bills, while species with smaller flowers were visited more frequently by birds with small bills.

The form given to functional responses dramatically affects the dynamics and stability of populations and communities. Despite their importance, functional responses are generally considered with a phenomenological approach, without clear mechanistic justifications from individual traits and behaviours. Here, we develop a bottom-up stochastic framework grounded in renewal theory that shows how functional responses emerge from the level of the individuals through the decomposition of interactions into different activities. Our framework has many applications for conceptual, theoretical and empirical purposes. First, we show how the mean and variance of classical functional responses are obtained with explicit ecological assumptions, for instance regarding foraging behaviours.

We examined the interaction of predation environment (presence of introduced brown trout, Salmo trutta) and habitat quality on growth and reproduction of southern leatherside chub, Lepidomeda aliciae, a small-bodied stream fish native to central Utah, USA. Southern leatherside chub were sampled from four streams representing a complete two-factor cross of predation environment and habitat quality. Growth was estimated using increment analysis of annuli on otoliths, and reproductive traits were measured for both sexes. Southern leatherside chub growth was greater in high-quality than in low-quality habitats, and greater in predator than in nonpredator environments. However, fish exhibited a greater growth response to presence of brown trout in low-quality habitats. Southern leatherside chub growth followed predictions of plastic responses to resource availability based on habitat quality and predation environment (lethal vs. nonlethal effects). Reproductive allocation (gonad wet mass) was significantly greater in low-quality versus high-quality habitats, but was unaffected by predation environment. Other female life-history traits were affected either by both effects or their interaction. Reproductive responses to habitat quality and predation environment were consistent with predictions based on differential mortality.

"Billman, EJ; Rasmussen, JE; Creighton, JC; Johnson, JB; Belk, MC",2014,A multivariate approach to the analysis of within lifetime variation in life history,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Ecological and environmental gradients create varying selective pressures on organisms that result in differences in optimal life history tactics. Moreover, life histories are inherently multivariate, consisting of a coordinated suite of life history traits that vary over an organism's lifetime. Such variation can be described as a trajectory of phenotypic change through time inmultivariate space defined by a set of life history traits. 2. We demonstrate the use of phenotypic trajectory analysis as a multivariate analytical approach for quantifying and comparing phenotypic change in life history throughout an organism's life. Life history trajectories have attributes - magnitude, direction, and shape - that can be quantified and statistically compared. We demonstrate the construction of trajectories using levels characterized by individuals with the same age or similar state, and we show how this approach can be used to evaluate the evolution of life history strategies given predictions from life history theory. 3. We demonstrate the utility of phenotypic trajectory analysis for life histories using two examples. We compare life history trajectories of burying beetles and show that females balance costs of reproduction differently based on resource availability. We also characterize life history trajectories of livebearing fish in different predation environments. We show that females in non-predator environments, but not predator environments, exhibit trajectories consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis. 4.

"Bino, G; Ramp, D; Kingsford, RT",2013,Niche evolution in Australian terrestrial mammals? Clarifying scale-dependencies in phylogenetic and functional drivers of co-occurrence,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"Interactive forces between competition and habitat filtering drive many biogeographic patterns over evolutionary time scales. However, the responsiveness of assemblages to these two forces is highly influenced by spatial scale, forming complex patterns of niche separation. We explored these spatial dependencies by quantifying the influence of phylogeny and functional traits in shaping present day native terrestrial mammal assemblages at multiple scales, principally by identifying the spatial scales at which niche evolution operates. We modelled the distribution of 53 native terrestrial mammal species across New South Wales, Australia. Using predicted distributions, we estimated the range overlap between each pair of species at increasing grain sizes (similar to 0.8, 5.1, 20, 81, 506, 2,025, 8,100 km(2)). We employed a decision tree to identify how interactions among functional traits and phylogenetic relatedness translated to levels of sympatry at increasing spatial scales. We found that Australian terrestrial mammals displayed phylogenetic over-dispersion that was inversely related to spatial scale, suggesting that ecological processes were more influential than biogeographic sympatry patterns in defining assemblages of species. While the contribution of phylogenetic relatedness to patterns of co-occurrence decreased as spatial scale increased, the reverse was true for habitat preferences. At the same time, functional traits also operated at different scales, as dietary preferences dominated at local spatial scales (< 10 km(2)) while body mass has a stronger effect at larger spatial scales. Our findings show that ecological and evolutionary processes operate at different scales and that Australian terrestrial mammals diverged slower along their micro-scale niche compared to their macro-scale niche. By combining phylogenetic and niche methods through the modelling of species distributions, we assessed whether specific traits were related to a particular niche. More importantly, conducting multi-scale spatial analysis avoids categorical assignment of traits-to-niches, providing a clearer relationship between traits and a species ecological niche and a more precise scaling for the axes of niche evolution.",10.1007/s10682-013-9631-5,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Mammals,Broad,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,1,1,0,,,0,T,0,0,1,0,1,,"Traits Used = mean body mass, dietary preference category (13 different ones), habitat preference (8 possible ones)",

Communities of spiders, ground beetles, true bugs and aphids were sampled in 2years along transects from the centre of organically managed cereal fields into adjacent grassy margins. Based on species richness, abundances, ecological and body size traits of species and taxonomic distinctness between species, communities were compared between organically managed cereal fields and their grassy margins. The species richness, abundance and variation in taxonomic distinctness of true bugs were significantly higher in grassy margins. For spiders and ground beetles, these metrics were either higher in cereal fields or did not differ significantly. At the species level, spiders living under stones or in soil crevices, as well as phytophagous ground beetles and true bugs that overwinter as eggs benefited from grassy margins. True bug communities in cereal fields were dominated by a few abundant species, whereas communities in margins were rather dominated by a few large species. Our comprehensive analyses highlight the importance of accounting for species identities and biology in biodiversity studies.

For the analyses, we used multiple partial regression to partition the specific effects of the topographic and spatial variables on the univariate data (standardised richness, total abundance and total biomass) and partial RDA (Redundancy Analysis) to partition these effects on composition (multivariate data) based on incidence, abundance and biomass. The different attributes (richness, abundance, biomass and composition based on incidence, abundance and biomass) used to study this metacommunity responded differently to environmental and spatial processes. Considering standardised richness, total abundance (univariate) and composition based on biomass, the results for common species differed from those obtained for all species. On the other hand, for total biomass (univariate) and for compositions based on incidence and abundance, there was a correspondence between the data obtained for the total community and for common species. Our data also show that in general, environmental and/ or spatial components are important to explain the variability in tree communities for total and common species. However, with the exception of the total abundance, the environmental and spatial variables measured were insufficient to explain the attributes of the communities of rare species. These results indicate that predicting the attributes of rare tree species communities based on environmental and spatial variables is a substantial challenge.

"Biswas, SR; Mallik, AU; Braithwaite, NT; Wagner, HH",2016,A conceptual framework for the spatial analysis of functional trait diversity,OIKOS,"Functional trait diversity is a popular tool in modern ecology, mainly used to infer assembly processes and ecosystem functioning. Patterns of functional trait diversity are shaped by ecological processes such as environmental filtering, species interactions and dispersal that are inherently spatial, and different processes may operate at different spatial scales. Adding a spatial dimension to the analysis of functional trait diversity may thus increase our ability to infer community assembly processes and to predict change in assembly processes following disturbance or land-use change. Richness, evenness and divergence of functional traits are commonly used indices of functional trait diversity that are known to respond differently to large-scale filters related to environmental heterogeneity and dispersal and fine-scale filters related to species interactions (competition). Recent developments in spatial statistics make it possible to separately quantify large-scale patterns (variation in local means) and fine-scale patterns (variation around local means) by decomposing overall spatial autocorrelation quantified by Moran's coefficient into its positive and negative components using Moran eigenvector maps (MEM). We thus propose to identify the spatial signature of multiple ecological processes that are potentially acting at different spatial scales by contrasting positive and negative components of spatial autocorrelation for each of the three indices of functional trait diversity. We illustrate this approach with a case study from riparian plant communities, where we test the effects of disturbance on spatial patterns of functional trait diversity. The fine-scale pattern of all three indices was increased in the disturbed versus control habitat, suggesting an increase in local scale competition and an overall increase in unexplained variance in the post-disturbance versus control community.

Here, we studied the effects of human-induced eutrophication on sympatric whitefish morphs in the Swiss lake, Lake Thun. In particular, we addressed the questions whether eutrophication (i) induced hybridization between two ecologically divergent summer-spawning morphs through a loss of environmental heterogeneity, and (ii) induced rapid adaptive morphological changes through changes in the food web structure. Genetic analysis based on 11 microsatellite loci of 282 spawners revealed that the pelagic and the benthic morph represent highly distinct gene pools occurring at different relative proportions on all seven known spawning sites. Gill raker counts, a highly heritable trait, showed nearly discrete distributions for the two morphs. Multilocus genotypes characteristic of the pelagic morph had more gill rakers than genotypes characteristic of benthic morph. Using Bayesian methods, we found indications of recent but limited introgressive hybridization. Comparisons with historical gill raker data yielded median evolutionary rates of 0.24 haldanes and median selection intensities of 0.27 for this trait in both morphs for 1948-2004 suggesting rapid evolution through directional selection at this trait. However, phenotypic plasticity as an alternative explanation for this phenotypic change cannot be discarded.

Individual traits, physiology and social state interact with environmental factors to increase the complexity of migratory systems. Despite a huge body of research, the ultimate causes of migration remain unclear. A relatively simple, tractable system giant tortoises on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos, was studied to elucidate the roles of environmental variation and individual traits in a partial migratory system. Specifically, we asked: (i) do Galapagos tortoises undergo long-distance seasonal migrations? (ii) is tortoise migration ultimately driven by gradients in forage quality or temperature; and (iii) how do sex and body size influence migration patterns? We recorded the daily locations of 17 GPS-tagged tortoises and walked a monthly survey along the altitudinal gradient to characterize the movements and distribution of tortoises of different sizes and sexes. Monthly temperature and rainfall data were obtained from weather stations deployed at various altitudes, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used as a proxy for forage quality. Analyses using net displacement or daily movement characteristics did not agree on assigning individuals as either migratory or non-migratory; however, both methods suggested that some individuals were migratory. Adult tortoises of both sexes move up and down an altitudinal gradient in response to changes in vegetation dynamics, not temperature. The largest tagged individuals all moved, whereas only some mid-sized individuals moved, and the smallest individuals never left lowland areas. The timing of movements varied with body size: large individuals moved upward (as lowland forage quality declined) earlier in the year than did mid-sized individuals, while the timing of downward movements was unrelated to body size and occurred as lowland vegetation productivity peaked. Giant tortoises are unlikely candidates for forage-driven migration as they are well buffered against environmental fluctuations by large body size and a slow metabolism. Notably the largest, and presumably most dominant, individuals were most likely to migrate.

We recorded bats acoustically at 83 sites (n = 249 recording nights) across the Plumas National Forest in the northern Sierra Nevada over 3 summers (2015-2017). We investigated relationships between fire regime, physiographic variables, forest structure and probability of bat occupancy for nine frequently detected species. We used fourth-corner regression and RLQ analysis to identify ecomorphological traits driving species-environment relationships across 17 bat species. Traits included body mass; call frequency, bandwidth, and duration; and foraging strategy based on vegetation structure (open, edge, or clutter). Relationships between bat traits and fire regime were underpinned by adaptations to diverse forest structure. Bats with traits adapting them to foraging in open habitats, including emitting longer duration and narrow bandwidth calls, were associated with higher severity and more frequent fires, whereas bats with traits consistent with clutter tolerance were negatively associated with fire frequency and burn severity. Relationships between edge-adapted bat species and fire were variable and may be influenced by prey preference or habitat configuration at a landscape scale. Predicted increases in fire frequency and severity in western US coniferous forests are likely to shift dominance in the bat community to open-adapted species and those able to exploit postfire resource pulses (aquatic insects, beetles, and snags).

Focusing on the current environmental characteristics, the 'habitat template' theory proposes that life-history strategies summarise how evolution has shaped species to cope with the temporal and spatial variability of their present environment. The hierarchical 'landscape filters' concept predicts that the distribution of species reflects their specific traits that allow them to pass through multiple habitat filters. Together, these theories showed the importance of identifying the functional relationships of species to selective habitat forces in order to predict the organisation and response of communities to the environment. 2. We test the relationships between life-history traits of European freshwater fish species' and their habitat preferences, to detect the strategies adopted by fish to cope with their current habitat. For this purpose, we use published data on species traits and habitat preferences (microhabitat hydraulics, temperature and oxygen level). We use multivariate analyses to classify fish species' strategies and test the relationships between strategies and habitat preferences. 3. We identified a continuum of life-history patterns between two extremes, with opportunistic and periodic species. Our study supports the idea that microhabitat hydraulics plays a more important role as a template for these species ecological strategies than temperature and oxygen level. Indeed, riffle habitats may select opportunistic species whereas weak relationships are found between species strategies and both their temperature and oxygen level preferences. In addition, the ratio between mortality and growth rate (dimensionless trait), reflecting a trade-off between growth and survival, varied among species according to the use of their hydraulic habitat, with species using deep habitats exhibiting the highest values. 4.

According to the differential equilibrium model, SSD in a given species is expected to result if opposing selection forces equilibrate differently in both sexes. Here I review the factors that affect the evolution of SSD specifically as they relate to behavior. Taking the approach that SSD results as an epiphenomenon from separate but related selection on male and female body size, the advantages and disadvantages of large size in terms of the standard components of individual fitness (mating success, fecundity, viability, growth, foraging success) are discussed to help guiding future research on the subject. This includes a discussion of intra-SSDs. The main conclusions are: (1) Evidence for disadvantages of large body size is still sparse and requires more research. In contrast, evidence for sexual or fecundity selection favoring large body size is overwhelming, so these mechanisms do no longer require special attention, but need to be documented nonetheless to acquire a complete picture. (2) Some hypotheses suggesting that small size is favored are not well investigated at all, because they apply only to some species or restricted situations, may be difficult to study, or have simply been disregarded. Evidence for these cryptic hypotheses is best revealed using experiments under multiple environmental (food, temperature, etc.) stresses with particularly well-suited model species. (3) The evolution of SSD ultimately depends on processes generating variation within as well as between the sexes, so studies should always investigate and report effects on both sexes separately, in addition to size-dependent effects within each sex; within sexes the key issue is whether small individuals under, over- or perfectly compensate their general fitness disadvantage. (4) Tests of several hypotheses should be integrated in case studies of well-suited model species to investigate selection on body size comprehensively. For example, all episodes of sexual selection (mate search, competition, pre- and post-copulatory choice) should be addressed in conjunction. Investigations of size-selective and sex-dependent predation should take the viewpoint of the prey rather than the predator to permit integration of effects throughout prey ontogeny generated by various predators with differing preferences. Comparative studies should also test multiple alternative hypotheses at the same time to permit stronger inference. (5) Experimental behavioral studies of sexual and natural selection should provide selection differentials using the available standard methods. This would allow integration with phenomenological studies of selection and facilitate subsequent meta-analyses, which are very valuable in evaluating general patterns. (6) Comparative phylogenetic studies identifying patterns and phenomenological and experimental studies of model species that investigate particular mechanisms should be integrated, so that macro-evolutionary patterns can be linked to micro-evolutionary processes, which is the central paradigm of evolutionary ecology. (7) A major problem is the general difficulty of separating causes generating a particular body size and SSD over evolutionary time and its consequences for behavior and ecology today, i.e. today's researchers cannot completely avoid this 'ghost of SSD evolution past'.",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01147.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Bleicher, SS",2017,The landscape of fear conceptual framework: definition and review of current applications and misuses,PEERJ,"Landscapes of Fear (LOF), the spatially explicit distribution of perceived predation risk as seen by a population, is increasingly cited in ecological literature and has become a frequently used ""buzz-word"". With the increase in popularity, it became necessary to clarify the definition for the term, suggest boundaries and propose a common framework for its use. The LOF, as a progeny of the ""ecology of fear', conceptual framework, defines fear as the strategic manifestation of the cost-benefit analysis of food and safety tradeoffs. In addition to direct predation risk, the LOF is affected by individuals' energetic-state, inter- and intra-specific competition and is constrained by the evolutionary history of each species. Herein, based on current applications of the LOF conceptual framework, I suggest the future research in this framework will be directed towards: (1) finding applied management uses as a trait defining a population's habitat-use and habitat-suitability; (2) studying multi-dimensional distribution of risk-assessment through time and space; (3) studying variability between individuals within a population; (4) measuring eco-neurological implications of risk as a feature of environmental heterogeneity and (5) expanding temporal and spatial scales of empirical studies.",10.7717/peerj.3772,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

In particular, for amphibians, cutaneous microbial communities likely play a significant role in pathogen defense; however, our ecological understanding of these communities is still in its infancy. Here, we take advantage of the fully endemic and locally species-rich amphibian fauna of Madagascar to investigate the factors structuring amphibian skin microbiota on a large scale. Using amplicon-based sequencing, we evaluate how multiple host species traits and site factors affect host bacterial diversity and community structure. Madagascar is home to over 400 native frog species, all of which are endemic to the island; more than 100 different species are known to occur in sympatry within multiple rainforest sites. We intensively sampled frog skin bacterial communities, from over 800 amphibians from 89 species across 30 sites in Madagascar during three field visits, and found that skin bacterial communities differed strongly from those of the surrounding environment. Richness of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and phylogenetic diversity differed among host ecomorphs, with arboreal frogs exhibiting lower richness and diversity than terrestrial and aquatic frogs. Host ecomorphology was the strongest factor influencing microbial community structure, with host phylogeny and site parameters (latitude and elevation) explaining less but significant portions of the observed variation. Correlation analysis and topological congruency analyses revealed little to no phylosymbiosis for amphibian skin microbiota. Despite the observed geographic variation and low phylosymbiosis, we found particular OTUs that were differentially abundant between particular ecomorphs. For example, the genus Pigmentiphaga (Alcaligenaceae) was significantly enriched on arboreal frogs, Methylotenera (Methylophilaceae) was enriched on aquatic frogs, and Agrobacterium (Rhizobiaceae) was enriched on terrestrial frogs. The presence of shared bacterial OTUs across geographic regions for selected host genera suggests the presence of core microbial communities which in Madagascar, might be driven more strongly by a species' preference for specific microhabitats than by the physical,physiological or biochemical properties of their skin. These results corroborate that both host and environmental factors are driving community assembly of amphibian cutaneous microbial communities, and provide an improved foundation for elucidating their role in disease resistance.",10.3389/fmicb.2017.01530,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Other,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,1,1,1,"Taxonomic = Microbiota of amphibeans (frogs).

Given the putative importance of birds as predators of diurnal Lizards, it is of considerable interest to know which traits (of lizards as well as birds) influence the outcome of a predatory attempt. We studied predation by giant terrestrial kingfishers (kookaburras, Dacelo novaeguineae: Alcedinidae) on heliothermic diurnal lizards (highland water skinks, Eulamprus tympanum: Scincidae), with particular reference to the role of prey (lizard) size. Our approach was twofold: to gather direct evidence (sizes of lizards consumed in the field, compared to those available) and indirect evidence rite-related shifts in lizard behaviour). We quantified the size structure of a natural population of skinks (determined by an extensive mark-recapture program), and compared it to the sizes of wild lizards taken by kookaburras (determined by analysis of prey remains left at the birds' nests,. Kookaburras showed size-based predation: they preyed mainly on small and medium-sized rather than large lizards in the field. However, the mechanism producing this bias remains elusive. It is not due to any distinctive behavioural attributes (locomotor ability, activity level, habitat usage) of the lizards of the size class disproportionately taken by the kookaburras. The greater vulnerability of subadult lizards may reflect subtle ontogenetic shifts in ecological and behavioural traits, but our data suggest that great caution is needed in inferring patterns of vulnerability to predation from indirect measures based on either the prey or the predator alone.

"Blumstein, DT",2006,Developing an evolutionary ecology of fear: how life history and natural history traits affect disturbance tolerance in birds,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"When approached by humans, virtually all species flee, but we lack an understanding of the factors that influence flight response among species. Understanding this variation may allow us to understand how 'fear' structures communities, as well as to predict which species are likely to coexist with humans. I used flight initiation distance (FID) as a comparative metric of wariness and examined the relative importance of life history and natural history traits in explaining variation in FID in 150 species of birds. In a series of comparative analyses, I used independent contrasts to control for phylogenetic similarity and regressed continuous life history traits against flight initiation distance. Body size had a large and significant effect in explaining variation in flightiness: larger species initiated flight at greater distances than smaller species. After controlling for variation explained by body size, there was a nonsignificant positive relation between the age of first reproduction and FID. There were no relations between FID and clutch size, number of days spent feeding young, longevity, or habitat density. I used concentrated changes tests to look for evidence of coevolution between flightiness and dichotomous traits. Flightiness evolved multiple times and some clades were flightier than others. Flightiness was more likely to evolve in omnivorous/carnivorous species and in cooperatively breeding species. These results suggest that body size and age of first reproduction are important in explaining variation in disturbance tolerance in birds, and that species that capture live prey and those that are highly social are relatively wary. The results suggest a novel mechanism of how anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to extinction. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Bluthgen, N",2010,Why network analysis is often disconnected from community ecology: A critique and an ecologist's guide,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Network analyses of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species are very popular, but their biological interpretations are often unclear and incautious. Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either (1) niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or (2) impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host-parasitoid or plant-animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as 'specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that 'dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species 'depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology.

Checkered beetles, soft-winged flower beetles and their allies (superfamily Cleroidea), exhibit well-known aposematic colour patterns, particularly in the family Cleridae, which participate in mimicry complexes mostly with unpalatable beetles, ants and velvet ants representing a Mullerian-Batesian continuum. Many cleroids also exhibit attenuated hardening of cuticular layers resulting in a soft-bodied appearance. Here, a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the entire Cleroidea was performed using sequences of two nuclear and two mitochondrial loci of similar to 4 kb total length. Inferred phylogenies were used to reconstruct ancestral colour patterns and involvement in mimicry complexes. The hypothesis of a soft-bodied ancestor of Cleridae and allies was tested. The phylogenetic analyses corroborated the expanded Cleroidea concept including Byturidae and Biphyllidae formerly classified as Cucujoidea. Character state optimization showed cryptic coloration was the ancestral state in Cleroidea, from which aposematic coloration originated several times in distant cleroid lineages. Within Cleridae, mimicry also arose from an ancestor that was cryptic, and multiple lineages that mimicked unpalatable beetles (Chrysomelidae, Meloidae, Lycidae) and stinging Hymenoptera evolved. Aposematic coloration was acquired in all major clerid lineages including Thanerocleridae, which are either the sister group of Chaetosomatidae or Cleridae. These findings suggest that mimetic traits in the clerid clade evolved at various times, possibly soon after the origin of soft-bodiedness. The adaptive value of aposematism in cleroids is likely to be enhanced in soft-bodied species, as this trait provides limited means of protection against predators, and therefore may promote the acquisition of aposematic and mimetic coloration in various ecological situations.",10.1111/zsc.12132,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Despite a rapidly expanding quantitative literature, it remains challenging to conceptualize concurrent changes in multiple trait dimensions (trait space) and select quantitative functional diversity methods to test hypotheses prior to analysis. To address this need, we present a widely applicable framework for visualizing ecological phenomena in trait space to guide the selection, application, and interpretation of quantitative functional diversity methods. We describe five hypotheses that represent general patterns of responses to disturbance in functional community ecology and then apply a formal decision process to determine appropriate quantitative methods to test ecological hypotheses. As a part of this process, we devise a new statistical approach to test for functional turnover among communities. Our combination of hypotheses and metrics can be applied broadly to address ecological questions across a range of systems and study designs. We illustrate the framework with a case study of disturbance in freshwater communities.

"Boeve, JL; Blank, SM; Meijer, G; Nyman, T",2013,Invertebrate and avian predators as drivers of chemical defensive strategies in tenthredinid sawflies,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: Many insects are chemically defended against predatory vertebrates and invertebrates. Nevertheless, our understanding of the evolution and diversity of insect defenses remains limited, since most studies have focused on visual signaling of defenses against birds, thereby implicitly underestimating the impact of insectivorous insects. In the larvae of sawflies in the family Tenthredinidae (Hymenoptera), which feed on various plants and show diverse lifestyles, two distinct defensive strategies are found: easy bleeding of deterrent hemolymph, and emission of volatiles by ventral glands. Here, we used phylogenetic information to identify phylogenetic correlations among various ecological and defensive traits in order to estimate the relative importance of avian versus invertebrate predation. Results: The mapping of 12 ecological and defensive traits on phylogenetic trees inferred from DNA sequences reveals the discrete distribution of easy bleeding that occurs, among others, in the genus Athalia and the tribe Phymatocerini. By contrast, occurrence of ventral glands is restricted to the monophyletic subfamily Nematinae, which are never easy bleeders. Both strategies are especially effective towards insectivorous insects such as ants, while only Nematinae species are frequently brightly colored and truly gregarious. Among ten tests of phylogenetic correlation between traits, only a few are significant. None of these involves morphological traits enhancing visual signals, but easy bleeding is associated with the absence of defensive body movements and with toxins occurring in the host plant. Easy bleeding functions through a combination of attributes, which is corroborated by an independent contrasts test indicating a statistically significant negative correlation between species-level integument mechanical resistance and hemolymph feeding deterrence against ants. Conclusions: Our analyses evidence a repeated occurrence of easy bleeding, and no phylogenetic correlation including specific visual signals is significant. We conclude that the evolution of chemically-based defenses in tenthredinids may have been driven by invertebrate as much as by avian predation. The clear-cut visual signaling often encountered in the Nematinae would be linked to differential trends of habitat use by prey and predators. Further studies on (prey) insect groups should include visual signals and other traits, as well as several groups of natural enemies, to better interpret their relative significance and to refine our understanding of insect chemical defenses.",10.1186/1471-2148-13-198,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Here, we tested whether potent defensive chemicals produced de novo by larvae of Argidae and Pergidae sawflies have influenced the evolutionary relationship between larval appearance and levels of gregariousness. Phylogeny-based correlation analyses indicated only a weak trend for solitary species to be cryptic, and for gregarious ones to be conspicuous. Numerous Argidae were cryptic-solitary or conspicuous-gregarious, whereas most Pergidae were conspicuousgregarious. Both families also included not truly gregarious but aggregated species, i.e. with individuals more evenly distributed on the host plant. By considering two specific morphological traits, predominant body coloration and contrasting spots on body, each one was (weakly) associated with appearance but none with gregariousness, which reflects the functional relevance of appearance as a whole. Furthermore, Argidae can display alternate appearances during successive larval instars. Finally, an independent contrasts test showed no obvious correlation between two major toxic peptides. Our results point towards diversely combined patterns of linked ecological traits in these insects. By assuming that warning coloration is more warranted against vertebrate than invertebrate predators, we suggest that the occurrence itself of toxins allowed this diversity via differing predator guilds and environmental factors, to which these insects were confronted during evolution.",10.1038/s41598-018-35925-z,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

MethodsA taxonomic and a trait-based approach were combined to evaluate the relative influence of habitat characteristics, burn severity and biotic processes on understorey regeneration at multiple spatial scales. Sampling of understorey vegetation cover was carried out in 133 recently burned plots located in 14 different fires across a 600-km transect. The spatial hierarchy for sampling consisted of five fire regime zones (regional scale), two to four fires within each zone (landscape) and two to four toposequences within each fire (local). The environmental control of fire severity and habitat characteristics on understorey regeneration was assessed using a canonical redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning. We investigated environmental and biotic filters of species traits at different scales by modelling trait-spatial assemblages with Moran eigen vector maps (MEMs). ResultsIn spite of the large variability of environmental conditions covered by our sampling design, low depths of burn were measured in the large majority of the studied sites. Incomplete consumption of the forest floor is frequently observed in eastern boreal forests characterized by long fire cycles. In situ biological legacies persisted through the low-severity fires, which conserved the pre-fire relationships between plant communities and their environment. As a result, fire severity was neither the unique nor the dominant control on post-fire regeneration.

The optimal capture effort then reflects a balance between the marginal benefit of greater success and the marginal cost of added energy outlay. Using this model, we explore how the optimum responds to variation in prey traits (evasiveness and energy value).

A central assumption in functional ecology is that interspecific trait variability is higher than intraspecific variability. The ""stable species hierarchy"" hypothesis states that for similar species found in different environmental conditions, their species trait ranking is conserved. In this study, we applied this trait hierarchy concept prevalent in plant ecology to the growing field of soil functional ecology, for which newly developed trait databases are being increasingly used. However, to date there have been few attempts to test for patterns of intraspecific trait variability (ITV) in these databases. We thus aimed to characterize how such patterns might influence (a) a species hierarchy based on trait values and (b) the conclusions of a trait-based analysis at a community level. To examine this, we used Collembola body size data (extracted from the BETSI database) as model trait. The source consisted of four regional trait datasets (Poland, Scandinavia, Spain and UK) and one dataset for which species traits are defined at a continental (European) scale. We found that, firstly, species were consistently ranked in all the trait datasets, although slight differences were observed between continental and northern European (i.e. Scandinavia and UK) trait datasets. In the two northern datasets, body size was higher (ca. 10%), indicating an intraspecific body size gradient from temperate to colder northern regions that we assumed could be explained by latitudinal patterns. Secondly, using selected published species abundance matrices (from experimental studies), we calculated the community-weighted mean body size using various trait datasets. The findings showed that the slight discrepancies observed between trait datasets can lead to different conclusions. This work confirms that properly defining the extent of ITV in databases is of primary importance to ensure robust conclusions. This is particularly important for databases hosting large-scale data that might be influenced by biogeographical patterns as latitudinal gradients. We recommend using a local regional trait dataset when available or, if not, a continental trait dataset. As trait databases are now commonly used tools for performing trait-based analyses, it is crucial to carefully select the data used to make inferences.

"Bonsall, MB",2010,The impact of non-lethal synergists on the population and evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interactions,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"Multiple pathogenic infections can influence disease transmission and virulence, and have important consequences for understanding the community ecology and epidemiology of host-pathogen interactions. Here the population and evolutionary dynamics of a host-pathogen interaction with free-living stages are explored in the presence of a non-lethal synergist that hosts must tolerate. Through the coupled effects on pathogen transmission, host mass gain and allometry it is shown how investing in tolerance to a non-lethal synergist can lead to a broad range of different population dynamics. The effects of the synergist on pathogen fitness are explored through a series of life-history trait trade-offs. Coupling trade-offs between pathogen yield and pathogen speed of kill and the presence of a synergist favour parasites that have faster speeds of kill. This evolutionary change in pathogen characteristics is predicted to lead to stable population dynamics. Evolutionary analysis of tolerance of the synergist (strength of synergy) and lethal pathogen yield show that decreasing tolerance allows alternative pathogen strategies to invade and replace extant strategies. This evolutionary change is likely to destabilise the host-pathogen interaction leading to population cycles. Correlated trait effects between speed of kill and tolerance (strength of synergy) show how these traits can interact to affect the potential for the coexistence of multiple pathogen strategies. Understanding the consequences of these evolutionary relationships is important for the both the evolutionary and population dynamics of host-pathogen interactions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Bonte, D; Lens, L; Maelfait, JP",2006,Sand dynamics in coastal dune landscapes constrain diversity and life-history characteristics of spiders,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. In fragmented landscapes where natural disturbance acts at the local level, community composition can be altered either by 'species-by-species matching', with community-wide character displacement, or by 'constrained species sorting', whereby disturbance favours species with distinct ecological traits. It is necessary to understand such species shifts when aiming to detect bottlenecks associated with changing disturbance dynamics at different spatial levels. Such an understanding also provides insight into the underlying ecological mechanisms in operation and allows identification of species of conservation concern. 2. This approach to understanding species' shifts was applied to a study of spider diversity and life-history variation in relation to sand dynamics in stabilized and dynamic grey dune landscapes located along the coasts of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. 3. Local (alpha) diversity appeared to decrease with increasing local sand dynamics in both stable and dynamic landscapes. In dynamic dune landscapes, beta-diversity decreased significantly and approached regional (gamma) diversity under local grey dune stabilization; in stabilized landscapes, beta-diversity was not affected by local sand dynamics. 4. Comparative analyses of ecological traits revealed shifts in life-history patterns, suggesting that patterns in local diversity resulted from species sorting. Species from fragments characterized by high sand dynamics showed narrower niche breadths, larger body sizes and longer generation times, while summer-active species tended to become residential after sand stabilization. This provides evidence for constrained species sorting in which natural disturbance (through local sand dynamics) allows only species with distinct ecological traits to persist. 5. Synthesis and applications. Species with larger body sizes, longer generation times and a higher degree of habitat specialization (i.e. related to dispersal ability) would be expected to be more vulnerable at dynamic sites and more prone to extinction than their counterparts from stabilized fragments. In particular, species with a burrowing lifestyle would be expected to go extinct locally as a result of increasing soil development and soil hardness. Shifts in species composition were found to be more pronounced in dynamic landscapes. Hence ensuring conservation of sand dynamics at a landscape level rather than at a local level is of prime importance when aiming to conserve typical psammophilous spider species within local assemblages in grey dune habitats.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.001175.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,1,1,,,0,P,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = body size, balooning propensity (a precursor for aerial dispersal in spiders), seasonal activity (time of the year when they're active), time to maturity, nocturnal/diurnal/neither.

The term community' is applied ambiguously; in some cases, the term refers simply to a set of observed entities, while in other cases, it requires that these entities interact with one another. Microorganisms can rapidly gain and lose genes, potentially decoupling community roles from taxonomic and phylogenetic groupings. Trait-based approaches offer a useful alternative, but many traits can be defined based on gene functions, metabolic modules, and genomic properties, and the optimal set of traits to choose is often not obvious. An analysis that considers taxon assignment and traits in concert may be ideal, with the strengths of each approach offsetting the weaknesses of the other. Individual genes also merit consideration as entities in an ecological analysis, with characteristics such as diversity, turnover, and interactions modeled using genes rather than organisms as entities.

Plants may affect these processes directly or indirectly via the interaction with the rhizosphere community. Many studies on the impact of plant functional traits on ecosystem processes in wetlands focused on variability among species, neglecting the importance of intraspecific variability. Here we assessed the intraspecific genetically based variability of a common wetland plant for traits, potentially relevant for the removal of nitrogen compounds from the soil. We asked whether and how quantitative genetic variation is expressed differently depending on nitrogen availability and how it is structured within and among natural European populations of Juncus effusus. We partitioned the observed genetic variation into within- (broad-sense heritability) and among (Q(ST)) population components for mean traits and plasticities. We found a strong plastic behavior for all measured traits in response to nitrogen availability. Genetic variation for mean traits differed strongly among populations but was very low at population level. We could not demonstrate a general effect of nitrogen availability on genetic trait expression. Our results suggest that basic and applied studies on wetland ecosystem processes will benefit from a deeper understanding of intraspecific genetic variation for traits and plastic behavior which is also fundamental for breeding approaches or to predict evolutionary responses.

"Botta-Dukat, Z",2018,Cautionary note on calculating standardized effect size (SES) in randomization test,COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,"In community ecology, randomization tests with problem specific test statistics (e.g., nestedness, functional diversity, etc.) are often applied. Researchers in such studies may want not only to detect the significant departure from randomness, but also to measure the effect size (i.e., the magnitude of this departure). Measuring the effect size is necessary, for instance, when the roles of different assembly forces (e.g., environmental filtering, competition) are compared among sites. The standard method is to calculate standardized effect size (SES),i.e., to compute the departure from the mean of random communities divided by their standard deviations. Standardized effect size is a useful measure if the test statistic (e.g., nestedness index, phylogenetic or functional diversity) in the random communities follows a symmetric distribution. In this paper, I would like to call attention to the fact that SES may give us misleading information if the distribution is asymmetric (skewed). For symmetric distribution median and mean values are equal (i.e., SES = 0 indicates p = 0.5). However, this condition does not hold for skewed distributions. For symmetric distributions departure from the mean shows the extremity of the value, regardless of the sign of departure, while in asymmetric distributions the same deviation can be highly probable and extremely improbable, depending on its sign. To avoid these problems, I recommend checking symmetry of null-distribution before calculating the SES value. If the distribution is skewed, I recommend either log-transformation of the test statistic, or using probit-transformed p-value as effect size measure.",10.1556/168.2018.19.1.8,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Botta-Dukat, Z; Czucz, B",2016,Testing the ability of functional diversity indices to detect trait convergence and divergence using individual-based simulation,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. The quest for 'assembly rules', that is the processes shaping the species composition of communities, is a central issue in community ecology. Nevertheless, so far there is no general agreement on a framework to detect assembly rules in real-life data: several key elements are still missing or heavily disputed, including the choice of the appropriate test statistic (e.g. functional diversity index) and randomization strategy for each major assembly process. 2. Simulation studies based on artificial communities can help to explore the usefulness of different approaches in detecting assembly rules. Nevertheless, the currently dominant approach to simulate artificial communities (i.e. selecting species from a pool based solely on trait values) oversimplifies the complex processes involved in community assembly and thus fails to produce realistic patterns. Consequently, its value for testing methodologies is seriously limited. 3. In this study, we implemented a flexible, individual-based algorithm simulating real-life community processes (individuals are born, survive, compete for resources, reproduce and die), to generate artificial species composition data. With the help of this algorithm, we estimated the type I error rates and the statistical power of five different diversity indices (FRic, Rao's quadratic entropy, FEve, the variance of functional distances, and the variance of nearest-neighbour distances) in combination with three randomization strategies (randomization of trait values in the whole data set, within-plots and within the range of trait values occurring in each plot) for detecting two underlying assembly processes (habitat filtering and limiting similarity). We also tested the influence of all adjustable simulation parameters on the simulation results in a sensitivity analysis framework. 4. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the individual-based simulation framework proposed here can be used for creating artificial community data with realistic pattern of trait values. Based on the results, Rao's quadratic entropy performed best for detecting both habitat filtering (trait convergence) and limiting similarity (trait divergence). Functional richness may also be suitable for detect traiting convergence. Functional evenness and variance of nearest-neighbour distances, however, should not be used for finding assembly rules.",10.1111/2041-210X.12450,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Bottom, Daniel L.; Simenstad, Charles A.; Burke, Jennifer; Baptista, Antonio M.; Jay, David A.; Jones, Kim K.; Casillas, Edmundo; Schiewe, Michael H.",2005,Salmon at River's End: the role of the estuary in the decline and recovery of Columbia River salmon.,NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NWFSC,"The continued decline of Columbia River salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations has long focused concerns on habitat changes upriver, particularly the effects of large hydroelectric dams. Increasing evidence that ocean conditions strongly influence salmon production, however, has raised questions about the importance of the estuarine environment to salmon and whether the hydropower system has affected estuarine-rearing habitats. In response to Northwest Power Planning Council recommendations, we initiated a review of what is known about the effects of the hydroelectric system on the hydrology, habitats, and ecology of the Columbia River estuary. Our goal was to develop recommendations for improving estuarine conditions or to identify research that may be needed before appropriate salmon-management changes can be defined. Our review and analyses addressed four major questions: 1) What habitats and processes support native salmon populations during the estuarine phase of their life cycle? 2) Have changes to the estuary had a significant role in salmon decline? 3) What have been the impacts of flow regulation on the hydrology, habitat, and biological interactions in the estuarine ecosystem? 4) What estuarine conditions are necessary to maintain salmonid diversity in the Columbia River basin? Conclusions and Recommendations The results indicate that habitat and food-web changes within the estuary and other factors affecting salmon population structure and life histories have altered the estuary's capacity to support juvenile salmon. Diking and filling activities that decrease the tidal prism and eliminate emergent and forested wetlands and floodplain habitats have likely reduced the estuary's salmon-rearing capacity. However, simplification of the population structure and life-history diversity of salmon possibly is the most important factor affecting juvenile salmon performance. In the absence of data on present-day estuarine use by wild, subyearling (""ocean-type"") salmon, we concluded that basin-wide upriver habitat losses, overharvest, and production-oriented hatchery management practices clearly influence patterns of salmon abundance, diversity, and residency in the estuary. Restoration of estuarine habitats, particularly diked emergent and forested wetlands, and flow manipulations to restore historical flow patterns might significantly enhance the estuary's productive capacity for salmon. It is possible that historical changes in population structure and salmon life histories, however, prevent salmon from fully utilizing the productive capacity of estuarine habitats even in their presently altered state. Therefore, efforts to improve or restore the estuary for salmon must be developed in concert with hatchery, harvest, and upriver habitat improvements to recover those life history types that can benefit from estuary restoration. A sound historical and evolutionary context for interpreting modern estuarine habitat conditions and for developing salmon recovery strategies is needed. Without proper context, recovery actions may inappropriately target those few salmon life history types and habitats that are abundant today, further reinforcing salmon decline symptoms rather than expanding the basin's productive capacity. A strategy that continues emphasis on improving survival of a few Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) dominant types, particularly large hatchery yearlings and subyearlings with short estuarine residence times, may further narrow the distributions of size, migration timing, and rates of migration. This would result in concentrated use of the estuary and thus would prevent salmon from utilizing its full productive potential. While the extinction risk of many Columbia River populations implies the need for immediate recovery action, lack of data on estuarine habitat use by salmon requires that further study may be necessary before we can define appropriate restorative measures. Both of these concerns can be addressed by simultaneously initiating targeted restoration activities, where there is reasonable confidence in their ecological benefits, and collecting new data to better understand salmon habitat requirements and restoration needs. To achieve these ends, the following specific recommendations are offered: Adopt an Explicit Ecologically Based Conceptual Framework for Estuary Management and Restoration The lack of an explicit ecological framework for salmon conservation is a fundamental impediment to recovery efforts in the Columbia River basin. Such a framework is particularly important to direct recovery efforts in the estuary, where physical and biological interactions are complex and continually changing in response to tidal forces, river flows, and seasonal fluctuations in the composition of species assemblages. The lack of information about the estuarine-rearing requirements of juvenile salmon is the result of a long-standing ""production"" approach to salmon management and research. This approach assumes the estuary is a simple migration corridor in which mortality factors must be controlled, rather than a productive nursery ground where the varied habitat needs of diverse populations and life history types must be protected. In the estuary, the ecological requirements of salmon also must be placed in the broader context of factors at other life stages that shape population structure and life history. These factors determine whether juvenile salmon can realize the full productive potential of the estuary. We adapted a conceptual framework for this assessment (i.e., the ""member/vagrant"" hypothesis) that accounts for life cycle linkages to salmon performance in the estuary and for the diverse life histories and resilience of Columbia River populations. Protect and Restore Opportunity for Salmon to Access Emergent and Forested Wetlands in the Estuary and Riparian Wetlands in the Tidal Floodplain Historical losses of peripheral floodplain, wetland, and riparian habitats from diking and filling activities in the Columbia River estuary have reduced available rearing habitat for salmon with subyearling life histories. Such effects may not be limiting to yearling, stream-type juveniles at present because hatcheries, harvest, and upriver habitat losses tend to favor these life histories. Any effort to increase life history diversity, however, will require reestablishment of important rearing habitats that have been substantially modified or removed from the estuary. Studies in other Northwest estuaries indicate that wetland restoration could offer a cost-effective method to improve salmonid rearing conditions. Reestablishment of more natural flow regimes in the basin might also diversify estuarine habitat opportunity and its associated variety of salmon rearing and migration behaviors. Reacquire Phenotypic Diversity of Salmon, Including a Broader Range of Sizes, Times of Entry, and Periods of Residency in the Estuary Although increased genetic and life history diversity of salmon may ultimately require long-term expansion of habitat opportunity upriver and in the estuary, rapid progress in the use of existing or restored habitats could be made by expanding phenotypic diversity of salmon now heavily influenced by hatchery programs. Such improvements could require reductions in hatchery releases or changes in hatchery rearing practices. Any management changes to benefit salmonid use of the estuary, however, will require an improved accounting system and a greater degree of coordination of basin-wide hatchery programs than presently exists. For example, incomplete records of hatchery release groups, variations in rearing and release practices that confound interpretation of management effects, and difficulties in distinguishing the hatchery or wild origin of unmarked salmon preclude a full accounting of the influence of hatchery practices on salmon behavior and performance in the estuary. Monitor Variations in Life History Diversity, Habitat Use, and Performance of Juvenile Salmon in the Estuary Because the abundance and life histories of salmon in the estuary are linked to source populations and habitats upstream, changes in life history diversity and the relative proportions of wild juveniles in the estuary may indicate whether recovery efforts are working basin wide. Unfortunately there is no established monitoring program to describe long-term trends in salmon rearing behaviors in the estuary. Since 1914-1916, neither salmon scales nor otoliths have been collected or archived to evaluate changes in estuarine life history patterns. Most contemporary estuarine studies are of short duration, including numerous local-impact studies, and only rarely have they sampled many of the shallow habitats typically preferred by smaller subyearling salmon. Furthermore, the most consistent monitoring in the estuary has emphasized the migration rates and survival of large, hatchery-tagged fish, and poorly represents wild, ocean-type species and life histories that are likely most dependent upon estuarine conditions. A more representative sampling program is needed to monitor variability in the estuarine life histories and performance of salmon. Review the Scientific Basis for Proposed Habitat and Bathymetric Changes in the Estuary Relative to the Restoration Goals of the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program Habitat changes and economic activities within the estuary have been evaluated independently of management or restoration efforts that affect salmon and their habitats elsewhere in the Columbia River basin. For example, the potential effects of ongoing or proposed estuarine dredging, spoil disposal, or habitat-restoration activities on the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program have not been explicitly evaluated. Because all anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River pass through or rear in the estuary before migrating to the ocean, changes in estuarine conditions could determine the effectiveness of salmonid recovery efforts throughout the basin. Modeling results show that estuarine habitat opportunity for salmonids is sensitive to bathymetric change. In addition, the response of predacious birds to artificially created dredge-spoil islands in the lower estuary illustrates that at least some estuarine habitat changes may have unexpected ecological consequences. Impact assessments associated with dredging and disposal activities usually have focused on localized impacts and have not considered salmonid responses to changes in habitat opportunity or capacity at a landscape scale. Nor have the assessments considered the history of incremental change upon which each new project is superimposed or the broader responses of the ecosystem to physical habitat modifications. Use Physical Observations and Hydrodynamic Modeling to Assess the Effects of Bathymetric Change, Flow Regulation, and Alternative Restoration Designs on Habitat Opportunity for Juvenile Salmon The hydrodynamic model applied in this assessment has proven to be a useful approach for evaluating the relative effects of flow modification and bathymetric change on habitat opportunity for salmon. However, its present application is limited by several critical data gaps, including the lack of present-day, high resolution bathymetric data and physical observations for shallow regions of the estuary. For example, the ability of the model to characterize physical habitat opportunity relative to the depth criterion (much more so than opportunity determined with respect to the velocity criterion) was very sensitive to assumed bathymetric configurations in the shallow areas of the estuary. This emphasizes the need to obtain accurate bank-to-bank bathymetric data for the lower river and estuary for improved understanding of the river flow impacts on physical habitat opportunity. Review Results of Estuarine Predation Studies in the Context of Salmon Population and Habitat Change It is unclear whether the high rates of salmon predation by Caspian terns (Sterna caspia) and other marine birds in the estuary is a significant factor affecting salmon recovery or an ecological symptom of other changes. Those changes might include alteration of estuarine habitats, simplification of the geographic structure of salmon populations, and reduced variation in salmon rearing and migration behaviors. High juvenile salmonid predation rates, however, could result from replacing a broad continuum of salmon life history types with punctuated releases of large hatchery fish that are concentrated in relatively few estuarine habitats over reduced time periods. Hatchery-induced changes in surface-feeding behavior also could be a factor increasing the vulnerability of salmon smolts to predators. Emphasis on estimating predation rates alone thus may lead to inappropriate salmon recovery proposals unless these results are evaluated in a broader historical and ecological framework. Assess the Effects of Altered Habitats and Food Webs on the Capacity of the Estuary to Support Juvenile Salmon The results indicate that a variety of ecological changes may have affected the estuary's capacity to support wild subyearling Chinook salmon. These changes include loss of floodplain and other wetland habitats, the effects of climatic changes on physical processes and estuarine food webs, interactions with an increasing number of nonindigenous species, and shifts in the timing of established patterns of river flow and salmon migrations. The direction or magnitude of these ecological changes, unfortunately, cannot be assessed from the limited empirical data available. The effects of altering food-web sources through habitat modifications, for example, have not been directly evaluated. We also have little data to assess the effects of a two-week advance in the spring freshet because of flow regulation and a substantial delay in peak salmon migrations because of hatchery and other influences. If estuarine prey-production cycles and salmon-migration behaviors are adaptive and linked to flow variations, then such changes could create a mismatch between salmon and their prey resources, reducing the productive capacity of the estuary. Changes in the coarse and fine sediment budgets, particularly the quality of organic matter input to the system, also are poorly understood. Research Approach and Results The first two sections establish the context for this evaluation, including a review of historical changes throughout the basin that have affected salmon and estuarine habitats, and the conceptual framework upon which our analyses and interpretations are based. The subsequent four sections describe results of the following analyses: * A review of climatic variations and human-induced changes in river flow during the past 140 years that have influenced estuarine-rearing opportunities and capacities for Columbia River salmon. * An evaluation of simulation modeling to understand the dynamics of salmon habitat opportunity within the estuary. * An assessment of ecological changes in the estuary that could affect the capacity of estuarine habitats to support salmon. * An analysis of historic changes in the estuarine performance of salmon using indicators of growth and life history variation. From the results of these analyses, we reexamine the validity of our conceptual framework and its implications for salmon and estuarine-habitat conservation. The principal findings of each of these chapters are briefly summarized below: Estuarine Development History and Salmon Decline Industrial development of the Columbia River and its estuary and declines in salmon populations are well documented. The effects of intensive harvest were apparent throughout the Columbia River basin by 1911, just as dam construction and irrigation diversion were beginning, and alterations to the estuary for navigation were unfolding. Increased salmon-conservation measures and management initiatives, however, coincided with the decline in freshwater habitat, regulation and diversion of river flow, and estuarine habitat loss and degradation. Installation of hydroelectric and irrigation diversion dams without providing for fish passage reduced salmon spawning and rearing habitat by 55%. Today, 23 mainstem and more than 300 tributary dams regulate the flow of the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean. Through this development history, the Columbia River became progressively channelized and detached from its floodplain. Approximately 65% of the tidal marsh and swamp habitat below Jones Beach (RKm 75) in Oregon had been diked or filled by the middle of the 20th century. The loss of these habitats between Jones Beach and Bonneville Dam (RKm 235) was likely greater but has not been quantified. Many other activities have degraded habitat throughout the estuary including upland logging and agriculture, shoreline armoring, construction of over-water structures, removal of large wood, and channel deepening and widening. In order to compensate for habitat losses and salmon decline, resource managers developed intensive hatchery programs that substituted concentrated releases of a few artificially produced stocks for the more diverse populations and life-history types that were formerly distributed throughout the watershed. As a consequence of these and other factors addressed in this analysis, historical Columbia River salmon returns between 11 million and 16 million fish annually have now declined to fewer than 12% of predevelopment levels. A Conceptual Framework for Evaluating Estuarine Habitat Conditions An agricultural approach to fisheries management that sought to eliminate apparent production ""bottlenecks"" has long ignored the estuary's role in supporting salmon populations. A fundamental impediment to salmon and estuary recovery, therefore, is the lack of a conceptual framework that adequately explains the evolutionary and ecological requirements of diverse salmon populations. For this assessment, we adapted a conceptual framework (the ""member/vagrant"" hypothesis) that was developed to explain the dynamics and population richness of marine species with complex life cycles. The member/vagrant hypothesis suggests that life history diversity in salmon is based on the geography of local, self-perpetuating populations and the variety of habitats that can support salmon life cycles. A crucial assumption of this framework is that the resilience of Columbia River salmon to natural environmental variability is embodied in population and life history diversity, which maximizes the ability of populations to exploit available estuarine rearing habitats. This framework recognizes variation in rearing behavior (phenotypic diversity) as the result of diverse salmon genotypes interacting with unique habitat features, including those within estuaries. These interactions result in a variety of alternative behavioral ""solutions"" for salmon to successfully complete their life cycles, such as variations in the timing and age of migration, duration of residency in the river and estuary, and size at ocean entry. The total productive capacity of the Columbia River basin for salmon, therefore, is a function of all combinations of genotype and habitat that allow for the full expression of salmon rearing and migration behaviors, including diverse life histories in the estuary. Any changes that sever the link between salmon behavior and habitat may affect the productive potential of the Columbia River estuary, for example: * removing or degrading estuarine habitats that salmon require to express the full diversity of potential rearing behaviors, * altering the geographic structure or genetic characteristics of component populations throughout the basin that converge in the estuary en route to the ocean, or * directly altering the phenotypic behavior of salmon through hatchery rearing and release practices, transportation of fish around dams, etc., regardless if the underlying genetic structure of populations is affected. In this evaluation, an effort was made to distinguish the role of the Columbia River hydropower system from other factors that influence the salmon rearing capacity of the estuary, including phenotypic or genetic effects that can determine whether salmon fully utilize this capacity. Our analyses emphasized subyearling ""ocean-type"" Chinook salmon, because this life history type makes maximum use of estuarine habitats and likely would be most sensitive to changes affecting the estuary. However, results of these analyses also should apply to other salmon species with ""ocean-type"" life histories, particularly chum salmon. Changes in Hydrological Conditions The magnitude and timing of river flow, which significantly influence estuarine habitat of juvenile salmon, have been highly modified at the watershed level. The predevelopment flow cycle of the Columbia River has been totally reshaped by hydropower regulation and irrigation withdrawal. While there is a prominent climate signal in river-flow variability over the period of the analysis (1859-present), the magnitude of maximum spring-freshet flow has decreased more than 40% from the predevelopment period (1859-1899) to the present. Flow regulation is responsible for approximately 75% of this loss, irrigation withdrawal for approximately 20%, and climate change for approximately 5%. The timing of maximum spring-freshet flow also has changed, primarily because of hydropower and irrigation development upriver, resulting in an approximate two-week shift earlier in the year (mean predevelopment date of 12 June compared to modern mean date of 29 May). Flow regulation now exacerbates early maximum spring-freshet peak flows, such as the 23 April freshet peak in the year 2000. Gradual climate warming also has contributed to the change in freshet timing. Also, the annual average flow at the mouth has been reduced from about 8,500 m3s-1 to less than 7,000 m3s-1, with climate change and water withdrawal each responsible for approximately 50% of the reduction. Changes in hydrology have had a significant impact on salmon habitat. Suppression of winter- and spring-freshet flows, compounded by flood-control diking and wetland reclamation below Bonneville Dam, has greatly reduced the frequency of overbank flows. Thus salmon rearing habitat in riparian areas and backwater channels has been blocked during flood events, and the input of large woody debris has been eliminated in the upper tidal floodplain. Riverine sediment transport to the estuary, an important process affecting the quantity and quality of estuarine habitat for salmon, is correlated with peak river flows. It is impossible to separate the effects of flow regulation and irrigation withdrawal precisely from climatic variability. However, it is estimated that the corresponding change in annual average sediment transport (at Vancouver, Washington) for 1945-1999 flows has been about 50-60% of the 19th century (1858-1899) virgin sediment transport. The reduction in sands and gravels is higher (>70% of predevelopment) than for silts and clays. In addition to peak spring-freshet flow and sediment-transport changes, the frequency in river-flow cycles is highly altered by the hydroelectric system's peaking cycle. Low frequency variations with periods between approximately two years and six months have been suppressed, and high frequency variations with periods of a week or less have been accentuated. We conclude that the hydrological changes in the basin have caused a fundamental shift in the physical state of the Columbia River ecosystem. The member/vagrant hypothesis implies that such changes, including stabilization of river flows and elimination of overbank flooding, may have significant consequences for salmon populations, whose migration and rearing behaviors have adapted to historical patterns of hydrologic variability. Estuarine Habitat Opportunity We evaluated a two-dimensional numerical circulation model as a tool for understanding the dynamics of habitat opportunity for juvenile salmon and the potential effects of anthropogenic changes in the estuary that affect these dynamics. The model simulated changes in the occurrence and distribution of shallow-water, low-velocity habitat during predevelopment (1880) and modern (1997-1999) periods. Predevelopment and modern river flows and estuarine bathymetry were used to simulate and compare the habitat opportunity (total hours that ""suitable habitat"" occur in a one-month simulation period) for salmon in the historical and present estuary. ""Suitable habitat"" for juvenile salmon was operationally defined using two physical criteria: areas with water depths ranging from 0.1 to 2 m and areas with water velocities less than 0.3 m3s-1. Results showed that availability of suitable habitat varies significantly within the estuary in response primarily to bathymetry but also to tides and river flows. Seasonal and interannual variability also is very significant, particularly in the upriver, tidal-freshwater mainstem region and upper-estuary peripheral bays, where habitat opportunity is reduced during freshet months. Based on meeting the velocity criterion in model simulations, habitat opportunity under modern river flows and estuarine bathymetry has generally declined in the upriver, tidal-freshwater mainstem region and the upper-estuary peripheral bays (Cathlamet and Grays), while it has not changed dramatically in the lower regions of the estuary. Model simulations of habitat opportunity based on the depth criterion, however, provide different results. Simulated depth regimes across the estuary suggest that habitat opportunity under modern flows and bathymetry has increased relative to historical conditions, except in the upper tidal-freshwater region. Yet limitations in the representation of modern bathymetry in the hydrodynamic model reduce confidence in the model simulation results based on the depth criterion. Moreover, estimates based on the velocity criterion appear much less sensitive to model uncertainties than those based on the depth criterion. Since our level of confidence in the simulation results varies for each criterion, the modern and historical habitat opportunity based on the depth and velocity criteria combined cannot be interpreted now. Furthermore, because peripheral wetlands that were historically diked and filled are not well represented in the predevelopment bathymetry, the simulations may underestimate predevelopment habitat opportunity to an unknown degree. Overall, model simulations have revealed several important features relating river flow and bathymetry to habitat opportunity: * First, the results suggest that habitat opportunity in some regions of the predevelopment estuary was more resilient to increasing river flows than it is in the modern estuary. Resilience in this context refers to a reduced rate of change (slope) when correlating hours of habitat opportunity with river flow. This result was evident only in the upriver, tidal-freshwater mainstem region (above the main body of the lower estuary) and the upper-estuary peripheral bays (Cathlamet and Grays). * Second, in the model simulations, estuarine bathymetry largely determined habitat availability as defined by the velocity and depth criteria described above. In addition, simulations of habitat opportunity under predevelopment bathymetry but with modern flows again suggested that bathymetric changes and habitat loss may be more influential in changing habitat opportunity than flow regulation. * Third, seasonal changes in habitat opportunity have shifted between historical and modern conditions. Minimum habitat opportunity in the estuary is associated with freshets that now occur earlier in the year than they did in the late 1800s. The impact of advancing the period of minimum habitat opportunity for juvenile salmon is unknown. These characterizations of change in shallow-water habitat are preliminary and must be viewed cautiously. Model predictions have not been empirically validated in regions without instrumentation, including the important shallow-water environments of Cathlamet Bay. Moreover, inadequacies in the modern bathymetric data affect habitat opportunity estimates, and substantial shoreline wetland and floodplain habitat lost to diking and filling are not fully incorporated in the simulations. Although preliminary, these results demonstrate that simulation modeling can provide useful insights into the physical dynamics of the estuary and may help to identify the relevant constituents of salmon ""habitat."" The model also predicts temporal and spatial changes in habitat opportunity that the member/vagrant hypothesis suggests could be significant to salmon diversity and resilience. Estuarine Habitat Capacity The productive capacity of the estuary has likely declined over the past century through the combined effects of diking and filling of shallow-water habitats, shifts from a macrodetritus-based to a microdetritus-based food web, and effects of introduced species. Loss of approximately 65% of the tidal marshes and swamps that existed in the estuary prior to 1870, combined with the loss of 12% of deepwater area, has contributed to a 12-20% reduction in the estuary's tidal prism. The absolute change in habitat area does not necessarily capture changes in habitat quality. For instance, while the dramatic loss of emergent and forested wetlands in the estuary has likely impacted foraging resources, the area of shallows and flats actually increased 7% between 1870 and 1980, which would have provided some additional foraging habitat. We have no means to objectively quantify the ecological effects of this habitat tradeoff because of the lack of historical data on the flora and fauna of these habitats. Although a substantial decline in wetland primary production and associated macrodetritus for the estuarine food web is implied by direct loss of emergent, forested, and other wetland rearing areas, reduced macrodetrital input to the food web may have been supplanted to some degree by an increase in microdetritus from upriver sources. The increase is principally in the form of phytoplankton production from the hydropower and flood-control reservoirs. The modern food web, however, does not support the same diversity of salmon life history types that occurred historically. The present microdetritus-based food web, which is centralized in the highly productive estuarine turbidity maximum region of the estuary, largely supports a pelagic food web that may contribute only indirectly to larger, yearling salmon. Significant changes in the modern estuarine community through species introductions have not been assessed. However, the Asian bivalve, Corbicula fluminea, has expanded far into the lower mainstem reservoirs and tributary basins since its introduction into the estuary in 1938. Pseudodiaptomus inopinus, a calanoid copepod also introduced from Asia, has appeared prominently in the estuary since 1980, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima) has grown to a substantial population in the Columbia River since its introduction in 1885-1886. Fifteen other nonindigenous fishes are now common in the estuary. The specific impacts on the estuarine ecosystem or on juvenile salmon in particular from any of these populations are speculative. However, given the tremendous abundance of C. fluminea and American shad (peak Bonneville Dam passage counts of 3 x 106), it is not unreasonable to expect that their consumption rates may have significantly modified the estuarine food web. Predation on juvenile salmon in the estuary by piscivorous fishes, marine mammals, and birds has always been a mortality factor. Yet there are no data to compare historical and modern predation rates or predator populations. Several unique predator populations, including Caspian terns, have increased significantly in recent decades and could constitute potential limiting factors on juvenile salmon survival. A major limitation of contemporary predation studies is that predator consumption may be substantially affected by changes in salmon migration behavior associated with hatchery rearing and release programs. Many of the changes in biological production processes that have occurred in the Columbia River estuary may be explained substantially by physical modifications that have altered the habitat landscape. These results lend further support to the member/vagrant hypothesis, which emphasizes the important role of physical and geographic factors (e.g., habitat opportunity) in shaping the dynamics and diversity of marine populations. These underlying physical linkages to estuarine production processes must be underst",,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Boukal, DS",2014,Trait- and size-based descriptions of trophic links in freshwater food webs: current status and perspectives,JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Biotic interactions in aquatic communities are dominated by predation, and the distribution of trophic link strengths in aquatic food
webs crucially impacts their dynamics and stability. Although individual body size explains a large proportion of variation in trophic link strengths in aquatic habitats, current predominately body size-based views can gain additional realism by incorporating further traits. Functional traits that potentially affect the strength of trophic links can be classified into three groups: i) body size, ii) traits that identify the spatiotemporal overlap between the predators and their prey, and iii) predator foraging and prey vulnerability traits, which are readily available for many taxa. Relationship between these trait groups and trophic link strength may be further modified by pop- ulation densities, habitat complexity, temperature and other abiotic factors. I propose here that this broader multi-trait framework can utilize concepts, ideas and existing data from research on metabolic ecology, ecomorphology, animal personalities and role of habitats in community structuring. The framework can be used to investigate non-additive effects of traits on trophic interactions, shed more light on the structuring of local food webs and evaluate the merits of taxonomic and functional group approaches in the description of predator-prey interactions.

A repeated measures approach to testing the stress-coping style model,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"It is widely expected that physiological and behavioral stress responses will be integrated within divergent stress-coping styles (SCS) and that these may represent opposite ends of a continuously varying reactive-proactive axis. If such a model is valid, then stress response traits should be repeatable and physiological and behavioral responses should also change in an integrated manner along a major axis of among-individual variation. While there is some evidence of association between endocrine and behavioral stress response traits, few studies incorporate repeated observations of both. To test this model, we use a multivariate, repeated measures approach in a captive-bred population of Xiphophorus birchmanni. We quantify among-individual variation in behavioral stress response to an open field trial (OFT) with simulated predator attack (SPA) and measure waterborne steroid hormone levels (cortisol, 11-ketotestosterone) before and after exposure. Under the mild stress stimulus (OFT), (multivariate) behavioral variation among individuals was consistent with a strong axis of personality (shy-bold) or coping style (reactive-proactive) variation. However, behavioral responses to a moderate stressor (SPA) were less repeatable, and robust statistical support for repeatable endocrine state over the full sampling period was limited to 11-ketotestosterone. Although post hoc analysis suggested cortisol expression was repeatable over short time periods, qualitative relationships between behavior and glucocorticoid levels were counter to our a priori expectations. Thus, while our results clearly show among-individual differences in behavioral and endocrine traits associated with stress response, the correlation structure between these is not consistent with a simple proactive-reactive axis of integrated stress-coping style. Additionally, the low repeatability of cortisol suggests caution is warranted if single observations (or indeed repeat measures over short sampling periods) of glucocorticoid traits are used in ecological or evolutionary studies focussed at the individual level.",10.1002/ece3.1395,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Freshwater,Fish,River,1,0,1,0,1,"Physiological, Behavioural",2,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = (Before Simulated Attack = Track length (total distance moved), percentage of time being active, percentage of tank basal area covered, time in the middle of the tank, time spent outside of refuge),(After simulated attack = emerge from refuge or not), cortisol concentrations.

Here, we apply a multilevel framework to partition effects of great tit fledging mass on first-year survival to hierarchical levels and quantify their ecological dependence using a data set spanning 51years. We show that estimates of the effect of fledging mass on first-year survival decline threefold from year- to brood- to individual level, so that estimates of selection depend strongly on the level at which they are calculated. We identify variables related to summer and winter food availability as underlying higher-level effects of fledging mass on first-year survival and show experimentally that brood-level effects originate early in development. Further, we show that predation and conspecific density modulate individual-level effects of fledging mass on first-year survival.

To alleviate this problem, we developed a graphing and analytical approach for use with more than two variables, based on previously established stable isotope bi-plot metrics. We introduce here our community metrics as R scripts. By extending the original metrics to multiple dimensions, we created n-dimensional plots and metrics to characterize any set of quantitative measurements of a community. We demonstrate the utility of these metrics using stable isotope data; however, the approaches are applicable to many types of data.

The effects of different environmental drivers on the changes in species' population abundances can be difficult to disentangle as they often act simultaneously. Researchers have built statistical models that include environmental variables (such as annual temperature) or species attributes (such as a species' temperature preference), which are assumed to detect the impacts of specific drivers (such as climate change). However, these approaches are often applied separately or, if combined, not explicitly compared. 2. We show the complementary insights gained by applying both these approaches to a community dataset on Danish terrestrial birds. We use our analysis to compare the relative importance of climate change and agricultural land-use change for the abundance changes within the community between 1983 and 2013. 3. Population models were fitted to the community data of species' annual abundances with predictors comprising: species attributes (species' temperature and habitat preferences), environmental variables (climatic and agricultural land-use change variables) or both. Relationships between species' abundances and environmental variables were used to identify the drivers associated with average abundance changes of species in the community. Relationships between species' abundances and their attributes were used to understand the drivers causing interspecific variation in abundance changes. 4. Warmer winters were positively associated with community-level abundances, and warm-adapted species had more positive abundance changes than cold-adapted ones. Agricultural land-use area was negatively associated with community-level abundances, and birds using a high proportion of meadow and habitat specialists had more negative abundance changes than birds using other habitats and habitat generalists. Effect sizes of environmental variables were larger for agricultural land-use change while those of species attributes were larger for climate change. 5. The environmental data approach suggested that agricultural land-use change has decreased the average abundances of species in the community, affecting total community size while the species attribute-based approach suggested that climate change has caused variation in abundance among species, affecting community composition. Environmental variables and species attributes that are hypothesized to link to specific drivers can be used together to provide complementary information on the impacts of different drivers on communities.",10.1111/1365-2656.12829,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,1,0,1,0,1,"Physiological, Behavioural",2,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,Global Change Multiple,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = temperature preference, migration, arable-land use/meadow use, habitat breadth.

"Bowles, J",2000,Shattered: Medawar's test tubes and their enduring legacy of chaos,MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,"Medawar's 1952 paper 'An Unsolved Problem of Biology' underlies most subsequent theoretical work regarding the evolution of aging; it concludes that aging is accidental and could not have evolved; this prevents reconciling the growing body of evidence suggesting the existence of multiple, evolved, aging systems. The paper features a well-known thought experiment using test tubes to show why aging could not evolve. Medawar assumes that constant, random, breakage sufficiently represents lethal forces of nature; however, famine, drought, predation, disease, and accidents each uniquely affect populations. Predation is the only evolving force that continually invents new ways to kill members of the prey populations; thus all prey defenses to predation will eventually be defeated. Defenses to non-evolving or non-obligate lethal forces, however, should quickly evolve. Thus unevolving, identical test tubes cannot adequately represent biological populations. The example also ignores population booms and busts which often occur in nature, By ignoring these issues, Medawar examines only one population age distribution skewed towards younger individuals in predator-dominated environments while ignoring predator-free populations skewed towards older individuals after population crashes. Further, Medawar's test tubes lack meaningful competition for finite resources, and ignore declining fertility which occurs in all aging species. Medawar concludes that older individuals are too few in number to influence the population's gene pool for or against aging. This conclusion is found to be incorrect when variations in the age of reproductive senescence are introduced into a predator-free population.A new thought experiment with competing strains of algae corrects for these issues and shows that aging evolved and is retained so that groups retain enough genetic variability to allow for rapid evolution of a defense to novel predation. The example shows reasons why the rate of aging is directly linked to the reproductive rate, litter size, metabolic rate, reproductive senescence, and fixed body size. It also suggests that in the absence of predation, immortality would quickly evolve if not for the evolution of highly-conserved aging systems.Prior analysis of aging evolution is incorrect due to theorists' rejection of the idea of group selection. It is believed to be 'impossible' to select for mutations that are bad for the individual but good for the group. However, mutations that are neutral to young individuals which are only deleterious if expressed at older ages can accumulate in early-mortality, predator-dominated environments. Removing the predator allows deleterious mutation expression. Positive group selection then occurs amongst traits that are negative to the individual. Further, group selection is a universal force that occurs between local, non-breeding groups and not, as theorists propose, between distant groups of potentially interbreeding species. Local survivors migrate to replace extinct, related species. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory, which was created to salvage the idea of accidental aging, is examined and shown to be untenable. The hypothetical antagonistic pleiotropy genes that are beneficial to young while detrimental to old individuals, predicted to exist in the 1950s, are unlikely to exist, have not, and likely will not be found in sufficient quantity to participate in the aging process.

There is growing evidence that green roofs - rooftops covered with vegetation - can contribute mitigate the loss of urban green spaces by providing new habitats for numerous arthropod species. Whether green roofs can contribute to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity and increase connectivity across urbanized areas remains, however, largely unknown. Furthermore, only limited information is available on how environmental conditions shape green roof arthropod communities. We investigated the community composition of arthropods (Apidae, Curculionidae, Araneae and Carabidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 green sites at ground level in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed how the site's environmental variables (such as area, height, vegetation, substrate and connectivity among sites) affect species richness and functional diversity using generalized linear models. We used an extension of co-inertia analysis (RLQ) and fourth-corner analysis to highlight the mechanism underlying community assemblages across taxonomic groups on green roof and ground communities. Species richness was higher at ground-level sites, while no difference in functional diversity was found between green roofs and ground sites. Green roof arthropod diversity increased with higher connectivity and plant species richness, irrespective of substrate depth, height and area of green roofs. The species trait analysis reviewed the mechanisms related to the environmental predictors that shape the species assemblages of the different taxa at ground and roof sites. Our study shows the important contribution of green roofs in maintaining high functional diversity of arthropod communities across different taxonomic groups, despite their lower species richness compared with ground sites. Species communities on green roofs revealed to be characterized by specific trait assemblages. The study also provides details on the environmental conditions that influence arthropod diversity and gives new perspectives on how the design of green roofs can be improved to increase their ecological value.

Since there is no common unit of observation, the significance of the relationships is tested using a double permutation procedure (site based and species based). This method implies that all species and sites are independent of each other. However, this fundamental hypothesis might be flawed because of phylogenetic relatedness between species and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data. Here, using a simulation-based experiment, we demonstrate how the presence of spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations can, in some circumstances, lead to inflated type I error rates, suggesting that significant associations can be misidentified. As an alternative, we propose a new randomization approach designed to avoid this issue, based on Moran's spectral randomization. In this approach, standard permutations are replaced by constrained randomizations so that the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis is built with additional constraints to preserve the phylogenetic and spatial structures of the observed data. The inclusion of this new randomization approach provides total control over type I error rates and should be used in real studies where spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations often occur.",10.1002/ecy.2530,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

HAB dynamics are determined by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors, and their emergence has often been linked to eutrophication, and more recently to climate change. The dinoflagellate Alexandrium is one of the most widespread HAB genera and its success is based on key functional traits like allelopathy, mixotrophy, cyst formation and nutrient retrieval migrations. Since 2012, dense Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms (up to 4500 cells mL(-1)) have recurred annually in a creek located in the southwest of the Netherlands, an area characterized by intense agriculture and aquaculture. We investigated how physical, chemical and biological factors influenced A. ostenfeldii bloom dynamics over three consecutive years (2013-2015). Overall, we found a decrease in the magnitude of the bloom over the years that could largely be linked to changing weather conditions during summer. More specifically, low salinities due to excessive rainfall and increased wind speed corresponded to a delayed A. ostenfeldii bloom with reduced population densities in 2015. Within each year, highest population densities generally corresponded to high temperatures, low DIN:DIP ratios and low grazer densities. Together, our results demonstrate an important role of nutrient availability, absence of grazing, and particularly of the physical environment on the magnitude and duration of A. ostenfeldii blooms. Our results suggest that predicted changes in the physical environment may enhance bloom development in future coastal waters and embayments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Social behavior is known to influence the ecological role of fishes; however, the ecological basis for pairing in reef fishes is not well understood. Field observations of 2,753 individuals, in 47 species in six families of biting reef fishes (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Kyphosidae, Labridae, Pomacanthidae, Siganidae), were used in combination with six morphological measurements, to examine the morphology of fishes in different social systems. A principal components analysis of morphological traits segregated species with high proportions of pairing individuals from non-pairing species along principal component 1, explaining 40.8 % of the variation. Pairing species were characterized by large eyes, concave foreheads, pointed snouts, deep bodies, and small maximum sizes. There was a significant positive relationship between these morphological traits (i.e., scores on PC1) and the prevalence of pairing within the Chaetodontidae (r (2) = 0.59; P = 0.026), Siganidae (r (2) = 0.72; P = 0.004), and Acanthuridae (r (2) = 0.82; P < 0.001). This was consistent when traits were corrected for phylogenetic effects. No pattern was evident in the scarine Labridae (r (2) = 0.15; P = 0.17). The morphological characteristics found among pairing species suggest that pairing species share common ecological traits, including foraging for small prey items in micro-topographically complex environments such as reef crevices.

"Brandt, LSE; Ludwar, BC; Greenfield, MD",2005,Co-occurrence of preference functions and acceptance thresholds in female choice: Mate discrimination in the lesser wax moth,ETHOLOGY,"Basic economic models adapted from foraging theory predict that decisions in mate choice may be determined either by 'best-of-n' preference functions or by sequential rules incorporating acceptance thresholds. However, in some species, more complex determinations that incorporate versions of both protocols are found. To understand the functions of co-occurring protocols, we studied mating decisions in the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), an acoustic species in which females prefer males, the advertisement songs of which are delivered at relatively high 'pulse-pair' rates. In addition to this preference, A. grisella females avoid mating with a male, the song of which does not exceed a minimum pulse-pair rate, and they hold to this criterion even when no other singing males are present and regardless of song amplitude. Thus, mating decisions are not simply based on acoustic power (pulse-pair rate x amplitude). We recorded male songs and female responses in an A. grisella population and found that male pulse-pair rates showed a median of 87/s and ranged from 50 to 115/s, while female acceptance thresholds for male song showed a median of 60/s and ranged from 30 to 105/s. The distributions of thresholds were approximately normal and were not significantly skewed toward the right. Male song rates declined slightly with age, but female thresholds remained stable over the adult lifespan. Both the male and female traits showed significant repeatability within individuals. Whereas phylogenetic inference indicates that hearing in pyralid moths originated as a means of avoiding predation by insectivorous bats, the specific distribution of female acceptance thresholds suggests that currently this protocol does not primarily function to preclude inappropriate, and potentially lethal, responses to bat echolocations: pulse rates in the searching-phase echolocations used by either aerial-hawking or substrate-gleaning bats mostly range from 10 to 20/s, and the lack of positive skew in the distribution of thresholds indicates an absence of directional selection from the left. Rather, we infer that thresholds augment preference functions in A. grisella by precluding mating with males which are markedly inferior in a critical song character. In general, co-occurring protocols may be important where population density fluctuates markedly, as preference functions may be ineffective in preventing mating with inferior males when density is low.",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01085.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Brantingham, PJ",1998,Hominid-carnivore coevolution and invasion of the predatory guild,JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY,"Coevolution is defined as reciprocal selective pressures that operate to make the evolution of one taxon partially dependent on the evolution another. This process often involves multiple species exploiting shared limiting resources. In classic coevolutionary models, populations of sympatric species are seen to diverge in one or more morphological, ecological, or behavioral traits to effect more even partitioning of resources and reduce levels of interspecific competition. Character displacement and resource partitioning are thought to be central not only to how species coexist on limited resources, but also to how species invade new resource niches. Hominid invasion of the predatory guild at least 2 my ago would have brought them into contact with a range of new selective pressures including competition with a number of large-bodied predators. This study explores resource partitioning between hominids and other Plio-Pleistocene large-bodied predators through analyses of predator food transport strategies. The anatomical content (head/limb MNE) of hominid transported faunal assemblages at Bed I Olduvai and FxJj 50 (Koobi Fora), when compared to modern predator control cases, suggests that Plio-Pleistocene hominids practiced food transport strategies intermediate between those of top predators such as wolves and those of confrontational scavengers such as spotted hyaenas. Plio-Pleistocene hominid food transport strategies do not resemble those of nonconfrontational scavengers such as brown and striped hyenas.

We tested four hypotheses related to the ecology and behavior of 75 species of African antelope using both conventional statistical techniques and techniques that account for the nonindependence of species by considering their phylogenetic relationships. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (1) dietary selectivity is correlated negatively with body mass, (2) dietary selectivity is correlated negatively with group size, (3) gregarious species either flee or counterattack when approached by predators, but solitary and pair-living species seek cover to hide, and (4) body mass and group size are correlated positively.

The results of our conventional and phylogenetically corrected analyses supported the hypotheses that group and body size vary predictably with feeding style and that antipredator behavior varies with group size. The hypothesis that body mass and group size are correlated positively was supported by conventional statistics, but these two traits were only weakly related using a phylogenetically corrected analysis. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative comparisons within each of the eight major African antelope tribes generally gave little support for the four hypotheses tested. Thus, although our analyses at the subfamily level provided results that were consistent with prior hypotheses, our analyses at the level of tribes were equivocal. We discuss several possible explanations for these differences.",10.1093/beheco/11.4.452,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Mammals,Broad,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behaviour",2,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = body mass, group size, diet, antipredator behaviour.

However, it is not clear whether such forms of competition can predict the collapse of communities and associated shifts in ecosystem function in the face of environmental change. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional trait data to test whether communities of two ecologically important guilds of tropical birds (frugivores and insectivores) are structured by species interactions in a fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. In both guilds, we found that forest patch size, quality, and degree of isolation influence the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of communities, with small, degraded, or isolated forest patches having an increased signature of competition (i.e., phylogenetic and functional trait overdispersion in relation to null models). These results suggest that local extinctions in the context of fragmentation are nonrandom, with a consistent bias toward more densely occupied regions of niche space. We conclude that the loss of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is mediated by niche-based competitive interactions among species, with potentially far-reaching implications for key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal and plant damage by phytophagous insects.",10.1890/14-1731.1.sm,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Birds,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,1,0,1,,,0,T,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = bill length, width and depth, wing length, length of primary projection, tarsus length, tail length -- extrapolated these traits to get = overall body size, trophic traits, locomotory traits, and dispersal traits.

For arthropods, environmental drivers of body size variation are still poorly documented and understood, especially in tropical regions. We use a unique dataset for two species-rich, phylogenetically independent moth taxa (Lepidoptera: Geometridae; Arctiinae), collected along an extensive tropical elevational gradient in Costa Rica, to investigate the correlates and possible causes of body-size variation. We studied 15 047 specimens (794 species) of Geometridae and 4167 specimens (308 species) of Arctiinae to test the following hypotheses: 1) body size increases with decreasing ambient temperature, as predicted by the temperature-size rule; 2) body size increases with increasing rainfall and primary productivity, as predicted from considerations of starvation resistance; and 3) body size scales allometrically with wing area, as elevation increases, such that wing loading (the ratio of body size to wing area) decreases with increasing elevation to compensate for lower air density. To test these hypotheses, we examined forewing length as a proxy for body size in relation to ambient temperature, rainfall, vegetation index and elevation as explanatory variables in linear and polynomial spatial regression models. We analysed our data separately for males and females using two principal approaches: mean forewing length of species at each site, and mean forewing length of complete local assemblages, weighted by abundance. Body size consistently increased with elevation in both taxa, both approaches, both sexes, and also within species. Temperature was the best predictor for this pattern (-0.98 < r < -0.74), whereas body size was uncorrelated or weakly correlated with rainfall and enhanced vegetation index. Wing loading increased with elevation. Our results support the temperature-size rule as an important mechanism for body size variation in arthropods along tropical elevational gradients, whereas starvation resistance and optimization of flight mechanics seem to be of minor importance.",10.1111/ecog.03917,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Tropcial Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,Traits Used = body size,

Curiously, little attention has been paid to the qualitative and quantitative variation of the seed-stored molecules and on their ecological significance. Here, we analysed the oil content and oil composition of ca. 200 weed seed species from agricultural fields in France based on single seed accessions, concentrating on interspecies differences and ignoring within-species variation. The relationships between seed weight, oil %, fatty acids (FAs) and the energetic value of the seed and its antioxidant properties were also investigated. The antioxidant activity could contribute to protect the oily seed reserves from alteration over time. Among the species analysed, we found a considerable quantitative (oil%) and qualitative variation of FAs stored in the seeds. Such variation was largely related to the plant family of the different species, but intrafamily variation was also found. Heavier seeds contained less oil on a per gram basis than lighter seeds, suggesting a trade-off between seed weight and oil ratio in the seed and that oil storage strategy depends on seed size. Moreover, oily seeds contained more polyunsaturated FAs. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we did not found a higher antioxidant capability in oily seed extracts than in non-oily seeds, nor to the quantitative or to the qualitative variation of FAs in the seeds.

Many scientific surveys already have such integrated databases. The present note aims to demonstrate that existing databases, herein from dedicated coastal nursery surveys, are actually underexploited. Such databases contain information on non-commercial taxa, which could greatly improve our knowledge on the organisation and functioning of coastal ecosystems. Using two datasets, a ""complete"" dataset composed of commercial and not-commercial epibenthic trawled species (fish and invertebrate) and a ""subset"" dataset characterized by commercial and routinely surveyed species (mainly fish and cephalopods), different measures of functional diversity are compared to identify the functional gains of including epibenthic species. The results show that, when included in the analyses. epibenthic taxa provide gains of functional information, associated mainly with the community feeding traits, i.e. organisms composing the primary and secondary consumer levels of the coastal nursery food web. Failure to include some of the primary (zooplanktivores and suspension feeders) and secondary consumers (detritivores-scavengers) in coastal survey analyses may, for instance, hamper our understanding of energy flux between the benthic and water column compartments of these ecosystems. The results also suggest that the exclusion of some taxa associated with these two food web compartments, may lead to the underestimation of the functional redundancy in coastal ecosystems.

"Bronikowski, AM; Clark, ME; Rodd, FH; Reznick, DN",2002,Population-dynamic consequences of predator-induced life history variation in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata),ECOLOGY,"A fundamental goal of population ecology is to quantify how spatial and temporal variation in life history traits translates into variation in population-level parameters such as vital rates and projected growth rate (lambda). Further emphasis has been on the sensitivity of lambda to absolute variation (sensitivities) and relative variation (elasticities) in vital rates, because lambda can be related to the evolutionary fitness of a life history phenotype (r = lnlambda). Furthermore, because density regulation can affect the expression and evolution of life history traits, which in turn can feed back on population dynamics, correctly incorporating the relationship between the two is critical to understanding the evolution and evolvability of life history strategies. Here we ask how life history variation affects projected population growth and evolutionary fitness dynamics in the long-term study system of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). There are striking differences in the life history traits of guppies that co-occur with two different assemblages of predators and so these populations are a model natural system for examining the fitness consequences of, and selective pressures on, traits that covary predictably. We found that populations experiencing high rates of predation had lower estimates of growth and fitness than did those experiencing low rates of predation (pooled r = 0.02 and 0.17, respectively). But when we incorporated density regulation in low predation sites, observed with field manipulations and modeled with simulations, this difference became negligible. Furthermore, for all populations irrespective of predators, growth rate was most sensitive to changes in neonatal growth and was contributed to maximally by early adult survival. Particularly in light of g-rowing concerns on correctly identifying sensitive life stages in overharvested fauna, addressing these questions in a long-term natural experimental system may provide guidance.",10.2307/3072051,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,1,0,,"Said N because I didn't see any relation to environmental filtering, but it did talk about population abundance, so I wanted to check that my estimation was right",

Here, we use null models and community phylogenetic analyses of co‐occurrence patterns to determine the role of pollinator‐mediated processes in structuring plant communities dominated by congeners. We surveyed three species‐rich genera (Limnanthes, Mimulus and Clarkia) with centres of diversity in the Sierra Nevada of California. Each genus contains species that co‐flower and share pollinators, and each has a robust phylogeny. Within each genus, we surveyed 44–48 communities at three spatial scales, measured floral and vegetative traits and tested for segregation or aggregation of: (i) species, (ii) floral traits (which are likely to be influenced by pollinators), and (iii) vegetative traits (which are likely affected by other environmental factors). We detected both aggregation and segregation of floral traits that were uncorrelated with vegetative trait patterns; we infer that pollinators have shaped the community assembly although the mechanisms may be varied (competition, facilitation, or filtering). We also found that mating system differences may play an important role in allowing species co‐occurrence.

This is surprising given the common co-occurrence of high levels of facilitation and clonality in some systems, for example arctic and alpine environments, and the possibility for clonality to play a role in regulating facilitation processes. I propose a number of areas where there is considerable potential for bringing these two topics together, including the re-analysis of large-scale databases and multi-site experiments, the development of modelling approaches combining both facilitation and clonality and the testing of these approaches through field experimentation.

However, it has previously been noted that this prediction does not agree with empirical observation in many signaling systems, where signals are limited to a small number of levels despite continuous variation in the trait being signaled. Typically, there is a critical value of the trait, with all individuals with trait values on one side of the threshold using the same cheap signal, and all those with trait values on the other side of the threshold using the same expensive signal. It has already been demonstrated that these classical models naturally predict such ""all-or-nothing signaling"" if it is additionally assumed that receivers suffer from perceptual error in evaluating signal strength. We show that such all-or-nothing signaling is also predicted if receivers are limited to responding to the signals in one of two ways.

For a long time, this topic has been addressed by traditional biodiversity experiments. Most of these approaches treat species as trait-free, taxonomic units characterizing communities only by species number without accounting for species traits. However, extinctions do not occur at random as there is a clear correlation between extinction risk and species traits. In this review, we assume that large species will be most threatened by extinction and use novel allometric and size-spectrum concepts that include body mass as a primary species trait at the levels of populations and individuals, respectively, to re-assess three classic debates on the relationships between biodiversity and (i) food-web structural complexity, (ii) community dynamic stability, and (iii) ecosystem functioning. Contrasting current expectations, size-structured approaches suggest that the loss of large species, that typically exploit most resource species, may lead to future food webs that are less interwoven and more structured by chains of interactions and compartments. The disruption of natural body-mass distributions maintaining food-web stability may trigger avalanches of secondary extinctions and strong trophic cascades with expected knock-on effects on the functionality of the ecosystems. Therefore, we argue that it is crucial to take into account body size as a species trait when analysing the consequences of biodiversity loss for natural ecosystems.

Food-web theory shows that the highest predator-prey body-mass ratios found in natural food webs may be especially important because they create weak interactions with slow dynamics that stabilize communities against perturbations and maintain ecosystem functioning. Identifying these vital interactions in real communities typically requires arduous identification of interactions in complex food webs. Here, we overcome this obstacle by developing predator-trait models to predict average body-mass ratios based on a database comprising 290 food webs from freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems across all continents. We analysed how species traits constrain body-size architecture by changing the slope of the predator-prey body-mass scaling. Across ecosystems, we found high body-mass ratios for predator groups with specific trait combinations including (1) small vertebrates and (2) large swimming or flying predators. Including the metabolic and movement types of predators increased the accuracy of predicting which species are engaged in high body-mass ratio interactions.

We describe a simple, generic approach to this problem - the core idea being to fit a predictive model for species abundance (or presence/absence) as a function of environmental variables, species traits and their interaction. We show that this method can be understood as a model-based approach to the fourth-corner problem - the problem of studying the environment-trait association using matrices of abundance or presence/absence data across species, environmental data across sites and trait data across species. The matrix of environment-trait interaction coefficients is the fourth corner. We illustrate that compared with existing approaches to the fourth-corner problem, the proposed model-based approach has advantages in interpretability and its capacity to perform model selection and make predictions. To illustrate the method we used a generalized linear model with a LASSO penalty, fitted to data sets from four different studies requiring different models, illustrating the flexibility of the proposed approach. Predictive performance of the model is compared with that of fitting SDMs separately to each species, and in each case, it is shown that the trait model, despite being much simpler, had comparable predictive performance, even significantly outperforming separate SDMs in some cases.",10.1111/2041-210X.12163,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Ecological traits, such as mobility or reproductive mode, explain variation in observed rates of shift for some taxa. However, estimates of relationships between traits and climate responses could be influenced by how responses are measured. We compiled a global data set of 651 published marine species' responses to climate change, from 47 papers on distribution shifts and 32 papers on phenology change. We assessed the relative importance of two classes of predictors of the rate of change, ecological traits of the responding taxa and methodological approaches for quantifying biological responses. Methodological differences explained 22% of the variation in range shifts, more than the 7.8% of the variation explained by ecological traits. For phenology change, methodological approaches accounted for 4% of the variation in measurements, whereas 8% of the variation was explained by ecological traits. Our ability to predict responses from traits was hindered by poor representation of species from the tropics, where temperature isotherms are moving most rapidly. Thus, the mean rate of distribution change may be underestimated by this and other global syntheses. Our analyses indicate that methodological approaches should be explicitly considered when designing, analysing and comparing results among studies. To improve climate impact studies, we recommend that (1) reanalyses of existing time series state how the existing data sets may limit the inferences about possible climate responses; (2) qualitative comparisons of species' responses across different studies be limited to studies with similar methodological approaches; (3) meta-analyses of climate responses include methodological attributes as covariates; and (4) that new time series be designed to include the detection of early warnings of change or ecologically relevant change.

Mathematical methods: We use the fitness-generating function (G-function) to derive ESS maximum principle and strategy dynamics along multi -dimensional adaptive landscapes. We apply the dynamics to two models of co-evolution of competitors and one model of predator-prey co-evolution. Results: When several traits evolve simultaneously (vector-valued strategies), a trait changes according to the product of each trait's fitness gradient and the matrix of covariances between the trait and the other traits. Only when these covariance terms are small does each trait in the strategy vector change in the direction of that trait's fitness gradient, similar to the scalar case. In the models, convergent stable points may be minima, maxima or saddle points. And the ESS may ultimately contain one, two or many species at distinct peaks of the adaptive landscape. The predator-prey model illustrates how the ESS strategy for the predator can result in an ESS for the prey that allows for any number of prey species to exist along a (flat) rim of a crater in the prey's adaptive landscape. Key conclusions: In going from a scalar to a vector-valued strategy, the adaptive dynamics become more complicated with respect to fitness gradients, the bestiary associated with convergent stable points increases, the avenues for adaptive speciation and achieving an ESS increase, and the number of non-ESS species that can co-exist ecologically increases.

Restoration of previously drained northern peatlands, primarily to promote peat and carbon accumulation, has created hundreds of thousands of new open water pools. We assessed the potential benefits of this wetland restoration for aquatic biodiversity, and how communities reassemble, by comparing pool ecosystems in regions of the UK Pennines on intact (never drained) versus restored (blocked drainage-ditches) peatland. We also evaluated the conceptual idea that comparing reference ecosystems in terms of their compositional similarity to null assemblages (and thus the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic assembly) can guide evaluations of restoration success better than analyses of community composition or diversity. Community composition data highlighted some differences in the macro invertebrate composition of restored pools compared to undisturbed peatland pools, which could be used to suggest that alternative end-points to restoration were influenced by stochastic processes. However, widely used diversity metrics indicated no differences between undisturbed and restored pools. Novel evaluations of restoration using null models confirmed the similarity of deterministic assembly processes from the national species pool across all pools. Stochastic elements were important drivers of between-pool differences at the regional-scale but the scale of these effects was also similar across most of the pools studied. The amalgamation of assembly theory into ecosystem restoration monitoring allows us to conclude with more certainty that restoration has been successful from an ecological perspective in these systems. Evaluation of these UK findings compared to those from peatlands across Europe and North America further suggests that restoring peatland pools delivers significant benefits for aquatic fauna by providing extensive new habitat that is largely equivalent to natural pools. More generally, we suggest that assembly theory could provide new benchmarks for planning and evaluating ecological restoration success. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Yet, surprisingly, the functional trait approach has not been applied to ecotones. A bog-forest sequence in southern New Zealand was sampled with a grid of quadrats, and eight traits related to leaf function were measured on the 54 species found. Two ecotones were identified using moving-window analysis: Ecotone I was the transition from bog to edge forest, and Ecotone II was the transition from edge forest to tall climax forest. No strict ecotonal species were present. In contrast to theoretical predictions, species richness was not higher or lower in either ecotone, rather, both ecotones represented a transition in richness from one community to the other. It has long been said that ecotones are mosaics, but species mosaicity was no higher in either ecotone than in the adjacent communities, in fact it was lower in Ecotone I. Functional trait diversity decreased along the sequence from bog to forest, with no deviation in either ecotone. However, examining mosaicity in terms of traits, there was a steady rise in Ecotone I and, in conformance with ecotone / functional trait theory, a clear peak in Ecotone II. We conclude that the features claimed for ecotones are often not present, and whether they are present is dependent on the components measured: species vs traits. Here, the clearest patterns were seen in trait mosaicity, but even this differed markedly between the two ecotones.

Raising awareness about the threat from multiple stressors has increased the number of experimental and observational studies specifically addressing consequences of stressor interactions on biota. Most studies measure the direct effects of multiple stressors and their interactions on biological endpoints such as abundance, biomass, or diversity of target organisms. This yields invaluable information for the management and restoration of stressed ecosystems. However, as we argue in our perspective paper, this common approach ignores a fundamental characteristic of communities and ecosystems, i.e., that organisms in ecosystems are interlinked by biotic interactions in ecological networks. Examples from the literature show that biotic interactions can modify stressor effects, transfer stressor effects to distant groups of organisms, and create new stressor interactions. These examples also suggest that changes in biotic interactions can have effects of similar or greater magnitude than direct stressor effects. We provide a perspective on how to include network characteristics and biotic interactions into analyses of multiple-stressor effects on ecosystems. Our approach can also make use of biomonitoring data produced with established and intercalibrated methods, and can combine it with novel metrics used to describe the functioning of ecosystems, such as trait information or stable-isotope measurements. The insights on network-mediated effects gained via the approach we propose can substantially increase mechanistic understanding of multiple-stressor effects, and in turn, the efficiency of ecosystem management and restoration.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

"Brunbjerg, AK; Ejrnaes, R; Svenning, JC",2012,Species sorting dominates plant metacommunity structure in coastal dunes,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"It has long been thought that environmental factors determine plant community assembly, but it is now increasingly argued that geographic spatial processes such as dispersal may also matter. Notably, the metacommunity framework considers local communities to be linked by dispersal and different theories hereunder assign varying importance to dispersal limitation and local environmental species sorting. At present the relative importance of these factors across habitats, geographic regions, and spatial scales remains unclear. The present study assessed the relative importance of species sorting by the local environment and broader-scale geographic spatial processes for local plant species composition using a data set of 3924 plots from coastal dunes across a large region (Denmark). We used ordination to identify the main gradients in species composition, and Linear Mixed-Effects modelling (LME) to estimate the relative importance of local environment and multi-scale random geographic factors as determinants of floristic gradients. In addition, we assessed the dependence of species composition on local environment and geographic distance using Mantel tests. The LME analyses found local species sorting to be the dominant determinant in this metacommunity system, with soil moisture, pH, and fertility requirement patterns explaining >= 77% of the compositional gradients, while geographic factors accounted for <= 2%. Partial Mantel tests confirmed this finding, with 31.6% of the variation in species dissimilarity explained by environmental species sorting and just 1.6% by geographical distance. The apparently limited impact of dispersal limitation or other geographic spatial processes may reflect high habitat continuity and efficient dispersal by strong winds and ocean currents in the Danish coastal-dune metacommunity system.

They create steep physiochemical gradients in the water column, which most notably include a dramatic draw down in oxygen concentrations over small vertical distances (<100 m). Microbial communities within OMZs play central roles in ocean and global biogeochemical cycles, yet we still lack a fundamental understanding of how microbial biodiversity is distributed across OMZs. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to investigate microbial diversity across a vertical gradient in the water column during three seasons in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) OMZ. Based on analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene fragments, we found that both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity declined steeply along the transition from oxygen-rich surface water to the permanent OMZ. We observed similar declines in the diversity of protein-coding gene categories, suggesting a decrease in functional (trait) diversity with depth. Metrics of functional and trait dispersion indicated that microbial communities are phylogenetically and functionally more over-dispersed in oxic waters, but clustered within the OMZ. These dispersion patterns suggest that community assembly drivers (e.g., competition, environmental filtering) vary strikingly across the oxygen gradient. To understand the generality of our findings, we compared OMZ results to two marine depth gradients in subtropical oligotrophic sites and found that the oligotrophic sites did not display similar patterns, likely reflecting unique features found in the OMZ.

We tested potential factors affecting variation in mean germination time (MGT), i.e., plant traits (adult longevity, dispersal mode and seed size) or phylogeny, to evaluate if these factors were independent or they had interaction. Nested ANOVA showed that taxonomic membership accounted for the majority of MGT variation (70%), and in the generalized linear model, family membership could explain independently the largest proportion of MGT variation (29%). The strong taxonomic effect suggests that MGT variation within taxonomic membership is constrained. The other plant traits could also explain MGT variation independently (1% by adult longevity and dispersal mode, respectively, and 2% by seed size). Thus, the phylogeny was an important constraint to maintain the stability of species, and we could simplify the question if we regarded the phylogeny as an individual factor, but we could not negate the adaptive significance of the relationship between other plant traits and seed MGT. In addition, a large percentage of the variance remained unexplained by our model, thus important selective factors or parameters may have been left out of this analysis. We suggest that other possible correlates may exist between seed germination time and additional ecological factors (for example, altitude, habitat and post-dispersal predation) or phylogenetic related morphological and physiological seed attributes (e.g., endosperm mass) that were not evaluated in this study.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,didn't actually test any ecological factors,

Yet, it is still difficult to predict how rapidly and consistently changes in one food web propagate to the other. An area of particular uncertainty is the response of plants to the changes in leaf litter nitrogen release caused by herbivores and detritivores. We combined a field experiment and theoretical analysis to assess how herbivory, fertilization, and detritivory changed leaf litter nitrogen release and plant growth. We produced leaf litter in greenhouse cages with a factorial combination of grasshopper herbivory and additional nitrogen fertilizer. Our experiment used the resulting N-15-labelled leaf litter to measure isopod litter consumption, litter nitrogen release, and plant nitrogen uptake in the field. We then used a dynamical systems model to distinguish whether plant growth relied (a) directly on litter nitrogen release or (b) on other nitrogen pathways so that changes in litter nitrogen release have little immediate impact. Our empirical results show that the effect of nitrogen fertilization on isopod processing of leaf litter was stronger than the effect of herbivory. Regardless, the available soil nitrogen and plant growth were independent of litter nitrogen release. Our dynamical model attributes the independence to other nitrogen sources and sinks, which buffer the plant-available nitrogen pool. Isopods and litter with a history of herbivory reduced above-ground plant growth when we accounted for initial field mesocosm conditions, especially the abundance of the competitively dominant goldenrods. Consequently, the impact of isopods and litter traits do propagate to influence plant growth, but do not have a large enough effect to overcome initial differences in plant biomass and community composition in one year. Synthesis. Our results indicate animals in green and brown food webs can alter plant litter nitrogen release without any significant nutrient recycling effect on plant growth. Considering the availability of external and soil-based nitrogen sources, as well as the current plant community and microbial biomass, may be critical to determining when plant growth will respond to animal-mediated changes in litter decomposition.",10.1111/1365-2745.13079,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

The positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) is a ubiquitous, but highly variable ecological pattern. Understanding this variation is a key challenge for community ecologists and little progress has been made using ecological trait data to predict variation in abundance and occupancy. 2. We used a data set from vascular plants in New Zealand South Island tussock grasslands measured at a landscape scale over 25 years to analyse AORs within a single habitat type. 3. We firstly modelled the interspecific relationship between abundance and occupancy across species. We then measured the deviations in the slopes of the abundance-occupancy relationship for individual species from this overall interspecific relationship and related these slope deviations to data on species' life-history and ecological traits. 4. Highly invasive species that increased their ranges and abundances during the 25-year study period had significantly steeper slopes in abundance-occupancy space than the interspecific relationship although species with increased dispersal ability did not. Those species that were clonal showed significantly shallower slopes suggesting that clonality causes species to respond more slowly in occupancy than abundance to changes in their environment. 5.

Community assembly is a fundamental process that has long been a central focus in ecology. Extending community assembly theory to communities of co-infecting parasites, we used a gastrointestinal nematode removal experiment in free-ranging African buffalo to examine the community assembly patterns and processes. 2. We first asked whether reassembled communities differ from undisturbed communities by comparing anthelmintic-treated and control hosts. Next, we examined the temporal dynamics of assembly using a cross-section of communities that reassembled for different periods of time since last experimental removal. Next, we tested for evidence of assembly processes that might drive such reassembly patterns: environmental filtering based on host traits (i.e. habitat patches), interspecific interactions, priority effects and chance dispersal from the environmental pool of infective stages (i.e. the regional species pool). 3. On average, reassembled parasite communities had lower abundance, but were more diverse and even, and these patterns varied tightly with reassembly time. Over time, the communities within treated hosts progressively resembled controls as diversity and evenness decreased, while total abundance increased. Notably, experimental removal allowed us to attribute observed differences in abundance, diversity and evenness to the process of community assembly. 4. During early reassembly, parasite accumulation was biased towards a subordinate species and, by excluding stochastic assembly processes (i.e. chance dispersal and priority effects), we were able to determine that early assembly is deterministic. Later in the reassembly process, we established that host traits, as well as stochastic dispersal from the environmental pool of infective stages, can affect the community composition. 5. Overall, our results suggest that there is a high degree of resiliency and environmental dependence to the worm communities of buffalo. More generally, our data show that both deterministic and stochastic processes may play a role in the assembly of parasite communities of wild hosts, but their relative importance may vary temporally. Consequently, the best strategy for managing reassembling parasite communities may also need to shift over time.",10.1111/1365-2656.12548,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,"They do talk about traits, but about the host traits, not the parasite traits, so there's actually no measure of how the traits of the organism (in this case the parasites) filter their distribution",

Here, I review major ecological patterns associated with the evolutionary history of cichlids, with particular focus on comparison of Afrotropical and Neotropical lineages. Specifically, I present major patterns of ecological diversification, potential mechanisms that may promote ecological diversification, and possible consequences of ecological diversification. Evolutionary convergence and specialization of ecological (e.g., diet), behavioral (e.g., benthic sifting), and morphological traits (e.g., oral dentition) characterize adaptive patterns that transcend continents. Craniofacial mechanics, the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, phenotypic plasticity, and hybridization may have facilitated diversification of cichlid fishes by generating functional, morphological, and/or genetic diversity. The benthic-pelagic axis has been an important source of divergence during adaptive radiation. Additionally, there are several discrepancies between Afrotropical and Neotropical lineages, such as the relative frequency of herbivorous species, the importance of hybridization in generating diversity, the relative frequency of dentition types, and relationships between dental organization and ecological function. Emphasis on contrasts between Neotropical and Afrotropical lineages improves characterization of patterns at a broader level of organization and indicates that the genetic basis, functional capacity, and ecological opportunity for many traits may be conserved across lineages.",10.1007/s10750-014-1960-z,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

We used stable isotope analysis to quantify TP among minnows across multiple assemblages that differed in their species composition, diversity and food web structure. Body size significantly predicted TP across different lineages and assemblages, and indicated a significant negative relationship. The observed negative relationship between body size and TP is contrary to conventional knowledge, and is likely to have arisen owing to highly clade-specific patterns, such that clades consist of either large benthic species or small pelagic species. Cyprinids probably subvert the physiological and mechanical constraints that generally produce a positive relationship between body size and TP using anatomical modifications and by consuming small-bodied prey, respectively. The need for herbivorous cyprinids to digest cellulose-rich foods probably selected for larger bodies to accommodate longer intestinal tracts and thereby to facilitate digestion of nutrient-poor resources, such as algae. Therefore, body size and TP are likely to have coevolved in cyprinids in association with specialization along the benthic to pelagic resource axis.",10.1098/rsos.150652,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Fish,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,Traits Used = body size,

They allow the detection of directional changes in community dynamics and ecosystemic processes, being an additional tool to assess biodiversity than species richness. Analysis of functional patterns in plant communities provides mechanistic insight into biodiversity alterations due to anthropogenic activity. Although studies have considered of either anthropogenic management or nutrient availability on functional traits in temperate grasslands, studies combining effects of both drivers are scarce. Here, we assessed the impacts of management intensity (fertilization, mowing, grazing), nutrient stoichiometry (C, N, P, K), and vegetation composition on community-weighted means (CWMs) and functional diversity (Rao's Q) from seven plant traits in 150 grasslands in three regions in Germany, using data of 6 years. Land use and nutrient stoichiometry accounted for larger proportions of model variance of CWM and Rao's Q than species richness and productivity. Grazing affected all analyzed trait groups; fertilization and mowing only impacted generative traits. Grazing was clearly associated with nutrient retention strategies, that is, investing in durable structures and production of fewer, less variable seed. Phenological variability was increased. Fertilization and mowing decreased seed number/mass variability, indicating competition-related effects. Impacts of nutrient stoichiometry on trait syndromes varied. Nutrient limitation (large N:P, C:N ratios) promoted species with conservative strategies, that is, investment in durable plant structures rather than fast growth, fewer seed, and delayed flowering onset. In contrast to seed mass, leaf-economics variability was reduced under P shortage. Species diversity was positively associated with the variability of generative traits. Synthesis.

Location: Australia.
Time Period: 1983Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012. Major Taxa Studied: Plants.
Methods: To quantify the scale and spatial patterns of this disparity, we estimated the existing tol- erance to thermal extremes of 7,124 Australian plants, more than one-third of the native continental flora, using data from cultivated records at 128 botanical gardens and nurseries. Hierarchical Bayesian beta regression was used to assess whether factors such as realized niches, traits or phylogeny could predict the incidence or magnitude of niche truncation (underestimation of thermal tolerances), while controlling for sources of collection bias.
Results: Approximately half of the cultivated species analysed could tolerate temperature extremes beyond those experienced in their native range. Niche truncation was predictable from the breadth and extremes of their realized niches and by traits such as plant growth form. Phylo- genetic relationships with niche truncation were weak and appeared more suited to predicting thermal tolerances directly.
Main conclusions: This study highlights a widespread disparity between realized and potential thermal limits that may have significant implications for speciesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ capacity to persist in situ with a changing climate. Identifying whether thermal niche truncation is the result of biotic interactions, dispersal constraints or other environmental factors could provide significant insight into commu- nity assembly at macroecological scales.

Because of these life-history associations, classification of foraging mode can be conceptually useful. Lizards figured prominently in the historical development of foraging mode concepts, yet our current understanding is dominated by only two lizard families which are good examples of the two extreme modes, sit-and-wait vs. active foraging. A great deal of lizard phylogenetic diversity remains unrepresented. Chameleons are a highly derived lizard taxon for which we have very little behavioural or ecological data, and no foraging mode data. Because chameleons are so unusual, it is not possible to predict where they will fit within the bimodal paradigm. I studied time budget and foraging mode in the Cape dwarf chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Several approaches were taken to assess foraging behaviour. First, lag-sequential analysis was applied to compare rates behaviours associated with observed eating events, which did not support a sit-and-wait foraging mode. Second, the number of moves per minute (MPM) and per cent time moving (%TM) were compared with those of other lizard taxa from the literature. Foraging in B. pumilum was found to be most consistent with an active foraging mode, although the MPM is unusually low. Thus I propose classification of B. pumilum as a cruise forager. Sufficient data are available to define a discriminant function for active vs. sit-and-wait modes among lizard speries, which classifys B. pumilum as active and additionally lends statistical support for good separation between foraging modes. These findings are discussed in relation to the evolution of foraging modes in chameleons and other lizard families.

"Butterfield, Bradley J.; Suding, Katharine N.",2013,Single-trait functional indices outperform multi-trait indices in linking environmental gradients and ecosystem services in a complex landscape,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"1. Functional traits can be used to describe the composition of communities through indices that seek to explain the factors that drive community assembly, biotic effects on ecosystem processes or both. Appropriately representing functional composition is therefore essential for predicting the consequences of environmental context and management actions for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in heterogeneous landscapes.2. Functional indices can be constructed from single or multiple traits; however, it is not clear how they differ in information content or ability to predict biodiversity - ecosystem function relationships in complex landscapes. Here, we compare the utility of analogous single-and multi-trait indices in linking environmental variation and functional composition to ESs in a heterogeneous landscape, relating functional indices based on three plant traits [height, relative growth rate and root density (RD)] to variation in the physical environment and to two ESs (forage production and soil carbon) and their net ES level.3. Two orthogonal gradients, elevation and soil bulk density (BD), explained significant variation in several dimensions of functional composition comprised of single traits. These traits in turn significantly predicted variation in ESs and their net values. Only one index measured with multiple traits (functional richness) varied with the physical environment, while none predicted variation in ES or net ES levels.4. One ES, soil carbon, increased with the community-average value of RD, while the other, forage production, was related to the range and community-average value of height. In turn, average RD increased with soil BD while the average and range of height declined with elevation. Due to these environmental patterns, soil carbon and forage production did not covary strongly, leading to moderate net ES levels across the landscape.5. Synthesis: Single-trait indices of functional composition best linked variation in environmental gradients with productivity and soil carbon. Because the environment-trait functioning relationships were independent of one another, the ESs were independently distributed across the landscape, providing little evidence of synergies or trade-offs. Single-and multi-trait indices contained unique information about functional composition of these communities, and both are likely to have a place in predicting variation in ESs under different scenarios.",10.1111/1365-2745.12013,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Physiological",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = height, relative growth rate, root density",

We analyzed the beta-taxonomic and beta-functional diversity across the main habitats and seasons, over a year time frame. Our results outline habitat type and vegetation biomass as the major factors structuring the communities. We found environmental variability to have a positive correlation with functional beta-diversity; however, no correlation was found with taxonomic a-diversity. Across the seasons, an asynchronous response of the functional and taxonomic beta-diversity was identified. The taxonomic composition displayed significant heterogeneity during the driest period and the functional composition during the rainy season. Across the habitats, the unvegetated ones presented higher taxonomic homogeneity and functional heterogeneity, contrary to the vegetated habitats that present higher taxonomic variability and functional homogeneity. Across the seasons and habitats, a pattern of functional redundancy and taxonomic replacement was identified. Moreover, high functional turnover versus low taxonomic turnover was documented in an anthropogenic organically enriched habitat We conclude that habitats display independent functional and taxonomic seasonal patterns and, thus, different processes may contribute to their variability.

However, Darwin provided two opposing predictions about the relatedness of introduced nonnatives to indigenous species.

Alternatively, if competition is important, we should expect successful invaders are distantly related to the native residents. These opposing expectations are referred to as Darwin's naturalization conundrum. The results of studies that examine nonnative species relatedness to natives are largely inconsistent. This inconsistency arises from the fact that studies occur at different spatial and temporal scales, and at different stages of invasion, and so implicitly examine different mechanisms. Further, while species have evolved ecological differences, the mode and tempo of evolution can affect species' differences, complicating the predictions from simple hypotheses.

"Cadotte, MW; Davies, TJ; Peres-Neto, PR",2017,Why phylogenies do not always predict ecological differences,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"The merger of phylogenies with ecology has given rise to the field of community phylogenetics, predicated on the assumption that ecological differences among species can be estimated from phylogenetic relationships (the phylogenetic distance/ecological difference, or PDED, hypothesis). A number of studies have failed to find strong support for this assumption, thus challenging the utility of phylogenetic approaches. This gap might highlight the fact that the PDED relationship is not useful for community assembly, but it is difficult to know because the lack of a relationship might also be due to a number of biological or methodological reasons, including inappropriate phylogenies, skewed distributions of phylogenetic distances, the lack of consideration of models of trait evolution, or the absence of sufficient niche space in experimental and observational venues. Each of these limitations, separately or combined, may confound recent experimental or observational results that examine relationships between phylogenetic distance and ecological differences. Notably, common evolutionary models can support alternative conclusions about the relationship between evolutionary distances and ecological differences than typically assumed and can change interpretations of community-based phylogenetic analyses. Here we review a number of issues that may lead to confounded effects in community phylogenetic analyses. In light of these potential pitfalls, we provide a number of guidelines for researchers to follow and stress that they need to address methodological shortcomings before concluding that ecological differences are unrelated to phylogenetic distances.",10.1002/ecm.1267,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Morphology is an integrative trait that combines functional and evolutionary information. However, the objective and quantitative description of the morphological diversity is quite challenging. Modern morphometrics encompass an array of mathematical approaches that turn shapes into quantitative variables. For models with no or only a few homologous points, outline analysis (e.g., elliptical Fourier transform) converts the outline geometry into quantitative variables, which can be used in the multivariate framework. The elliptical Fourier transform here describes the shape of 85 fish species found in the North Sea. This study shows that the main component of morphological diversity in the North sea is the elongation and development of dorsal, pelvic, and caudal fins. The spatial distribution of morphological diversity decreases along a latitudinal gradient, with higher diversity in the southern part of the study area. Compared to species diversity, our results indicate that environmental conditions filter morphological traits in the northern North Sea. Outline analysis is a powerful approach to provide an objective description of fish morphology and to improve our understanding of the diversity of large marine ecosystems. \",10.1002/ecs2.2220,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Fish,Continental Shelf,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = Body shape (used Fourier transformations to extrapolate from scoring of snout tip, anterior insertion of dorsal fin, dorsal and ventral insertion of the caudal fin, insertion of pelvic fin)",

Here, we use a large-scale and high-resolution data set on bird distribution to examine the robustness of the relationships between species diversity and functional or phylogenetic diversity. Location France Methods We measured the functional and phylogenetic diversity of 1914 bird assemblages monitored over 10 years with a standardized protocol. We investigated the consequences of incorporating abundance versus presence-absence data, changing the number and identity of traits considered, or varying the spatial scale used to estimate functional and phylogenetic diversity. We further examined the outcomes of different null model procedures that aim to reveal ecological processes influencing the distribution of each facet of diversity. Results We found that the shape and strength of the relationship between species diversity and functional diversity are structured by several methodological choices. We show that increasing the quantity of information yielded by the indices (in particular, including abundances or increasing the number of traits considered) decreases the amount of functional redundancy estimated. Reducing the number of functional traits used to estimate functional diversity can change and even reverse the relationship of interest. Moreover, using alternative null models, we highlighted the specific role of environmental filtering and the link between species abundances and their functional originality (defined for a given species as the average of the functional distances with other species). The same tests applied to phylogenetic diversity revealed that its relationship with species diversity varies differently suggesting that this latter index cannot be used as a proxy for functional diversity.

After briefly reviewing the timescale separations most common in coevolution theory, we use a general model of exploiter-victim coevolution to confront predictions from slow-evolution analysis with Monte Carlo simulations. We show how rapid evolution radically alters the dynamics and outcome of coevolutionary arms races. In particular, a fast-evolving exploiter can enable victim diversification and thereby lose a race it is expected to win. We explain simulation results, using mathematical analysis with relaxed timescale separations. Unusual mutation parameters are not required, since rapid evolution naturally emerges from slow competitive exclusion.

Posidonia oceanica (L) Delile meadows are experiencing severe decline, with significant effects on P. oceanica meadow biodiversity, food webs and associated ecological processes. Despite the importance of this habitat, very little information with which to comprehend and predict the effects of habitat loss on the trophic traits of meadow-dwelling species is available. 2. The study addressed the effect of changes in P. oceanica cover on the trophic niche of macroinvertebrate litter-associated species and on their consumption of various basal resources along the upper limit of a P. oceanica meadow in the central Tyrrhenian Sea. 3. Census data and C and N stable isotope analysis were used to characterize changes in the trophic niche of species and the contribution of basal resources to food webs along a meadow coverage gradient. 4. Falling P. oceanica cover was associated with lower species richness and animal density. In the low-coverage area of the meadow, the organic matter content of basal resources decreased, and the trophic generalism of species increased while their trophic niche overlap declined. In addition, consumption of living P. oceanica plants and epiphytes decreased, and consumption of sediment-derived organic matter increased. 5. The results suggest that the community associated with P. oceanica litter is particularly sensitive to meadow degradation, which affects trophic structuring and nutrient pathways within the food web.

Litterfall samples collected between 1996 and 2001 revealed that flowers and fruits were significantly more abundant in N-treated plots, and an analysis of oak tree abundance found significant variation both among and within plots. Acorn samples collected during 2003 and 2004 (a mast and a postmast year) were therefore analyzed using ANCOVA models that included an estimate of oak tree abundance. This tree abundance estimate was the only significant driver of increased acorn production during the mast year, and in both years it was a significant factor on plots receiving the highest levels of N. In the postmast year, acorn production was increased in direct response to N-related factors other than tree abundance. Our comparisons of control and N-treated plots for acorn quality traits (e.g. rates of acorn damage, germination percentage, seedling growth) revealed negligible or only transient differences.

Arboreal ants are extremely diverse and abundant, making them an interesting and valuable group for tackling this issue. Numerous studies have used observational data of species co-occurrence patterns to infer underlying assembly processes, but the complexity of these communities has resulted in few solid conclusions. This study takes advantage of an observational dataset that is unusually well-structured with respect to habitat attributes (tree species, tree sizes, and vegetation structure), to disentangle different factors influencing community organization. In particular, this study assesses the potential role of interspecific competition and habitat selection on the distribution patterns of an arboreal ant community by incorporating habitat attributes into the co-occurrence analyses. These findings are then contrasted against species traits, to explore functional explanations for the identified community patterns. We ran a suite of null models, first accounting only for the species incidence in the community and later incorporating habitat attributes in the null models. We performed analyses with all the species in the community and then with only the most common species using both a matrix-level approach and a pairwise-level approach. The co-occurrence patterns did not differ from randomness in the matrix-level approach accounting for all ant species in the community. However, a segregated pattern was detected for the most common ant species. Moreover, with the pairwise approach, we found a significant number of negative and positive pairs of species associations. Most of the segregated associations appear to be explained by competitive interactions between species, not habitat affiliations. This was supported by comparisons of species traits for significantly associated pairs. These results suggest that competition is the most important influence on the distribution patterns of arboreal ants within the focal community. Habitat attributes, in contrast, showed no significant influence on the matrix-wide results and affected only a few associations. In addition, the segregated pairs shared more biological characteristic in common than the aggregated and random ones.",10.1002/ece3.2606,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Tropical Rainforest,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,1,0,1,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = Nesting habitat preference, foraging strategy.

Mass at emergence is a life-history trait strongly linked to adult fitness. Therefore, when faced with transient food shortage in the larval stage, mass-correcting mechanisms are common. 2. These correcting mechanisms may carry costs with them. On one hand, these costs may be overestimated because they can be confounded with the direct effects of the transient food shortage itself. On the other hand, costs may be underestimated by ignoring physiological costs. Another largely neglected topic is that correcting mechanisms and costs may critically depend upon other stressors that often co-occur. 3. Here, we identify the mass-correcting mechanisms and their associated costs at emergence in the damselfly Coenagrion puella, after being stressed by a transient period of starvation and a subsequent exposure to pesticide stress during the larval stage. We introduce path analysis to disentangle direct costs of starvation and the mass-correcting mechanisms in terms of immune response. 4. As predicted, we found no differences in mass at emergence. Starvation directly resulted in a costly delayed emergence and a decreased immune response at emergence. Mass-correcting mechanisms included a prolonged post-starvation period, reduced mass loss at emergence and compensatory growth, although the latter only in females under pesticide stress. 5. The mass-correcting mechanisms were associated with beneficial effects on investment in immune response, but only in the absence of pesticide stress. Under pesticide stress, these beneficial effects were mostly undone or overruled, resulting in negative effects of the mass-correcting mechanisms in terms of immune response. 6.

M.",2013,"Movement, impacts and management of plant distributions in response to climate change: insights from invasions",OIKOS,"Synthesis Prediction and management of species responses to climate change is an urgent but relatively young research field. Therefore, climate change ecology must by necessity borrow from other fields. Invasion ecology is particularly well-suited to informing climate change ecology because both invasion ecology and climate change ecology address the trajectories of rapidly changing novel systems. Here we outline the broad range of active research questions in climate change ecology where research from invasion ecology can stimulate advances. We present ideas for how concepts, case-studies and methodology from invasion ecology can be adapted to improve prediction and management of species responses to climate change. A major challenge in this era of rapid climate change is to predict changes in species distributions and their impacts on ecosystems, and, if necessary, to recommend management strategies for maintenance of biodiversity or ecosystem services. Biological invasions, studied in most biomes of the world, can provide useful analogs for some of the ecological consequences of species distribution shifts in response to climate change. Invasions illustrate the adaptive and interactive responses that can occur when species are confronted with new environmental conditions. Invasion ecology complements climate change research and provides insights into the following questions: 1) how will species distributions respond to climate change? 2) how will species movement affect recipient ecosystems? And 3) should we, and if so how can we, manage species and ecosystems in the face of climate change? Invasion ecology demonstrates that a trait-based approach can help to predict spread speeds and impacts on ecosystems, and has the potential to predict climate change impacts on species ranges and recipient ecosystems. However, there is a need to analyse traits in the context of life-history and demography, the stage in the colonisation process (e.g. spread, establishment or impact), the distribution of suitable habitats in the landscape, and the novel abiotic and biotic conditions under which those traits are expressed. As is the case with climate change, invasion ecology is embedded within complex societal goals. Both disciplines converge on similar questions of when to intervene? and what to do? which call for a better understanding of the ecological processes and social values associated with changing ecosystems.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00430.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,"Don't test traits, just say we need to study them",

Strong relatedness of invaders to native communities as an indication of niche overlap could promote naturalization because of appropriate niche adaptation, but could also hamper naturalization because of negative interactions with native species (Darwin's naturalization hypothesis'). Although these hypotheses provide clear and opposing predictions for expected patterns of species relatedness in invaded communities, so far no study has been able to clearly disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesize that conflicting past results are mainly due to the neglected role of spatial resolution of the community sampling. In this study, we corroborate both of Darwin's expectations by using phylogenetic relatedness as a measure of niche overlap and by testing the effects of sampling resolution in highly invaded coastal plant communities. At spatial resolutions fine enough to detect signatures of biotic interactions, we find that most invaders are less related to their nearest relative in invaded plant communities than expected by chance (phylogenetic overdispersion). Yet at coarser spatial resolutions, native assemblages become more invasible for closely-related species as a consequence of habitat filtering (phylogenetic clustering). Recognition of the importance of the spatial resolution at which communities are studied allows apparently contrasting theoretical and empirical results to be reconciled. Our study opens new perspectives on how to better detect, differentiate and understand the impact of negative biotic interactions and habitat filtering on the ability of invaders to establish in native communities.",10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07479.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

A possibility that remains little-explored is that species differing in demographic or ecological attributes, or facing different selective pressures, show different community phylogenetic patterns, even within the same communities. Here I compare community phylogenetic patterns for fire-killed and fire-resistant Banksia species in the fire-prone shrublands of southwest Australia. Results: Using new Bayesian phylogenies of Banksia, together with ecological trait data and abundance data from 24 field sites, I find that fire regeneration mode influences the phylogenetic and phenotypic signal of species co-occurrence patterns. Fire-killed species (reseeders) show patterns of phylogenetic and phenotypic repulsion consistent with competition-driven niche differentiation, but there are no such patterns for fire-resistant species (resprouters). For pairs of species that differ in fire response, co-occurrence is mediated by environmental filtering based on similarity in edaphic preferences. Conclusions: These results suggest that it may be simplistic to characterize an entire community by a single structuring process, such as competition or environmental filtering. For this reason, community analyses based on pairwise species co-occurrence patterns may be more informative than those based on whole-community structure metrics.",10.1186/1472-6785-12-21,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial, Plants,Shrublands,0,0,0,1,0,Life History,1,1,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = fire resistance.

Recent studies have shown that a species' extinction risk may be determined by two types of factors: intrinsic biological traits and exposure to external anthropogenic threats. However, little is known about the relative and interacting effects of intrinsic and external variables on extinction risk. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that extinction risk in the mammal order Carnivora is predicted more strongly by biology than exposure to high-density human populations. However, biology interacts with human population density to determine extinction risk: biological traits explain 80% of variation in risk for carnivore species with high levels of exposure to human populations, compared to 45% for carnivores generally. The results suggest that biology will become a more critical determinant of risk as human populations expand. We demonstrate how a model predicting extinction risk from biology can be combined with projected human population density to identify species likely to move most rapidly towards extinction by the year 2030. African viverrid species are particularly likely to become threatened, even though most are currently considered relatively safe.

Why then, is it so hard to detect performance trade-offs at the whole-organismal level? Why do we sometimes even obtain positive correlations between two performance traits that are predicted to be negatively associated? Here we explore two plausible explanations. First, most analyses are based on individual maximal values (i.e., personal best), which could introduce a bias in the correlation estimates. Second, phenotypic correlations alone may be poor indicators of a trade-off when contrasting processes occur at the among-versus within-individual levels. One such scenario is the ""big houses big cars"" model developed in life-history theory to explain the existence of ""uberfleas"" that are superior in all regards (because they acquire more resources than others). We highlight that the exact opposite scenario might occur for performance trade-offs, where among-individual trade-offs may be masked by within-individual changes in physical condition. One of the best ways to test among these alternative scenarios is to collect repeated pairs of performance traits and analyze them using multivariate mixed models (MMMs). MMMs allow straightforward and simultaneous examination of trait correlations at the among-and within-individual levels. We use a simple simulation tool (SQuID package in R) to create a population of Krakens, a mythical giant squid-like sea creature whose morphology generates a performance trade-off between swimming speed and strength or ability to sink ships. The simulations showed that using individual maximum values introduces a bias that is particularly severe when individuals differ in the number of repeated samples (n(trial)). Finally, we show how MMMs can help detect performance (or any other type of) trade-offs and offer additional insights (e.g., help detect plasticity integration).

In this study, we ask whether populations within the monophyletic white protea clade (Protea section Exsertae, Proteaceae) differ in key functional traits along environmental gradients and whether differences are consistent with local adaptation. Using seven taxa, we measured trait-environment associations and selection gradients across 35 populations of wild adults and their offspring grown in two common gardens. Focal traits were leaf size and shape, specific leaf area (SLA), stomatal density, growth, and photosynthetic rate. Analyses on wild and common garden plants revealed heritable trait differences that were associated with gradients in rainfall seasonality, drought stress, cold stress, and less frequently, soil fertility. Divergent selection between gardens generally matched trait-environment correlations and literature-based predictions, yet variation in selection regimes among wild populations generally did not. Thus, selection via seedling survival may promote gradient-wide differences in SLA and leaf area more than does selection via adult fecundity.

However, current research has largely ignored the role of competition in modulating climate-growth relationships of mature trees. In this study, we assessed the effect of competition on tree responses to drought and interannual climate variability as well as linkages between climate sensitivity and morphological characteristics of the stem wood. We sampled 10 sites in north-eastern Washington, USA, and used dendroecology to quantify responses of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) to drought and climate variability. Tree-ring series were converted to basal area increment series, and the effects of competition on climate-growth relationships were assessed at the tree and site levels using a combination of correlation analyses and linear mixed-effects models. Competition did not affect tree responses to extreme drought. When soil moisture was below average, tree growth was tightly coupled to climate variability for all trees, regardless of their competitive status. However, in wet years, competition had a pronounced, positive effect on climate sensitivity of growth. Trees with more competition from neighbours exhibited a significantly higher proportion of sapwood area in latewood (a morphological trait associated with greater drought resistance).Synthesis. Our results suggest that a tree's ability to cope with environmental variability is driven not just by the proximate effects of neighbours on resource availability, but also by phenotypic plasticity and long-term adaptations to competitive stress (such as changes in carbon allocation).

Three open water stations were selected to reflect truly pelagic, influenced by littoral and riverine carbon sources: phytoplankton samples were collected from two water depths, 0-20 m and 25-50 m. Among stations differences in delta C-13 signatures of seston were statistically non significant, confirming that allochthonous input may become important only after exceptional rainfall events. Nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was utilized to identify among the phytoplankton parameters (taxonomic groups, MBFG, cell shapes, cell sizes) which were the best predictors of the PC variation. Bacillariophyceae and two morpho-functional groups, Group 6 (non-flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons) and Group 3 (large filamentous algae with aerotopes) were statistically significant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was used to investigate differences in phytoplankton samples and their relationship with delta C-13 variation.

Our study confirms that the variation in the pelagic VC seston most probably reflects changes in phytoplankton carbon isotopic signature, consequent to changes in availability of carbon sources depending on the season and due to different isotopic fractionation of phytoplankton taxonomic groups.

The trophic-functional types act as containers for individuals, within an individual-based model, sharing similar trophic behaviour and traits of biomass transformation. Biomass, or energy, flows between the types and this allows the key ecological properties of individual abundance and body mass, at each trophic height, to be followed through simulations. Our preliminary simulation results suggest that the model shows great promise. The simulation output for simple ecosystems, populated with realistic parameter values, is consistent with current laboratory observations and provides exciting indications that it could reproduce field scale phenomena. The model also produces output that links the individual, population and community scales, and may be analysed and tested using community, network (food web) and population dynamic theory. We show that we can include management effects, as perturbations to parameter values, for modelling the effects of change and indicating management responses to change. This model will require robust analysis, testing and validation, and we discuss how we will achieve this in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, their impact on the distribution of bee ecological traits has received little attention. In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes in the distribution of bee ecological traits along gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation were due to a direct effect of landscape context on multiple traits ('response traits') or to a correlation of response traits with other ecological traits not involved in the response of bee species to landscape context. In two study regions in southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat amount and fragmentation. Our findings suggest that improved knowledge about how trait-based responses mediate the impact of landscapes on wild bee communities will allow better prediction and understanding of subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning.",10.1111/ecog.02632,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,1,0,0,,,0,T,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = body size, diet breadth, nest location, sociality, timing of foraging season.

LocationCommon-environment study with Palaearctic and Nearctic pine species. MethodsWe grew 17 pine species (eight Palaearctic and nine Nearctic) in a common environment and measured the stem and needle concentrations of phenolics and non-volatile resin, two major quantitative chemical defences in pines. In particular, we studied the constitutive allocation to chemical defences (in control plants) and the potential inducibility of those traits in response to elicitation with hormonal analogues of the jasmonic acid (methyl jasmonate) and salicylic acid (benzothiadiazole) pathways of plant defence against herbivorous insects and pathogens. ResultsWe found a strong phylogenetic signal in the constitutive concentration of phenolics in the needles and resin in the stem, but not elsewhere. We found that Nearctic pines showed 70% greater concentration of constitutive needle phenolics than Palaearctic species. In contrast, the inducibility potential of defences did not differ between Nearctic and Palaearctic pine species. Main conclusionsOur findings suggest that macroevolutionary history (phylogeny and biogeographical origin combined) has played an important role in the evolution of needle constitutive defences among pine species, but not in that of induced defences. Specifically, constitutive allocation to pine chemical defences seems to be well preserved across the phylogeny.

Plant phenotypic traits are increasingly used as surrogates of species niches, but we lack an understanding of how key sampling decisions affect our ability to capture phenotypic differences among species. Using trait data of ecologically distinct monkeyflower (Mimulus) congeners, we employed linear discriminant analysis to determine how (1) dimensionality (the number and type of traits) and (2) variation within species influence how well measured traits reflect phenotypic differences among species. We conducted analyses using vegetative and floral traits in different combinations of up to 13 traits and compared the performance of commonly used functional traits such as specific leaf area against other morphological traits. We tested the importance of intraspecific variation by assessing how population choice changed our ability to discriminate species. Neither using key functional traits nor sampling across plant functions and organs maximized species discrimination. When using few traits, vegetative traits performed better than combinations of vegetative and floral traits or floral traits alone. Overall, including more traits increased our ability to detect phenotypic differences among species. Population choice and the number of traits used had comparable impacts on discriminating species. We addressed methodological challenges that have undermined cross-study comparability of trait-based approaches.

However, patterns of community dissimilarity (e.g. difference in species composition) are difficult to interpret in terms of the relative roles of these processes. Local communities can be more dissimilar (divergence) than, less dissimilar (convergence) than, or as dissimilar as a hypothetical control based on either null or neutral models. However, several mechanisms may result in the same pattern, or act concurrently to generate a pattern, and much research has recently been focusing on unravelling these mechanisms and their relative contributions. Using a simulation approach, we addressed the effect of a complex but realistic spatial structure in the distribution of the niche axis and we analysed patterns of species co-occurrence and beta diversity as measured by dissimilarity indices (e.g. Jaccard index) using either expectations under a null model or neutral dynamics (i.e., based on switching off the niche effect). The strength of niche processes, dispersal, and environmental noise strongly interacted so that niche-driven dynamics may result in local communities that either diverge or converge depending on the combination of these factors. Thus, a fundamental result is that, in real systems, interacting processes of community assembly can be disentangled only by measuring traits such as niche breadth and dispersal. The ability to detect the signal of the niche was also dependent on the spatial resolution of the sampling strategy, which must account for the multiple scale spatial patterns in the niche axis. Notably, some of the patterns we observed correspond to patterns of community dissimilarities previously observed in the field and suggest mechanistic explanations for them or the data required to solve them. Our framework offers a synthesis of the patterns of community dissimilarity produced by the interaction of deterministic and stochastic determinants of community assembly in a spatially explicit and complex context.",10.1371/journal.pone.0035942,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Yet, the majority of such research has been conducted on birds breeding at north-temperate latitudes. We tested the hypothesis that functional wing traits of Fork-tailed Flycatchers (Tyrannus savana), which migrate within South America, vary predictably between non-migratory and migratory flycatchers. Additionally, due to sex-specific differences in this species (e.g., males perform courtship displays), we explored sex-related variation in wing shape. We applied classic measures of wing shape (e.g., wing loading, length, aspect ratio, pointedness), as well as landmark-based morphometric analysis to describe the wing morphology of Fork-tailed Flycatchers from breeding populations across South America. We found that migratory flycatchers tend to have more pointed wings than non-migratory flycatchers. Additionally, we found that males have wings that are significantly longer, more pointed, with a higher aspect ratio and that are more swept than those of females, regardless of whether they migrate or not. Overall, our results suggest that wing shape of Fork-tailed Flycatchers is the result of a complex set of tradeoffs shaped by selective pressures exerted on both sexes (i.e., the need to forage on the wing, evade predators and migrate efficiently), as well as sex-specific behaviors (e.g., the need for males to execute acrobatic displays).",10.1007/s10682-018-9945-4,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = flight feather moult status, tarsus and bill length, body mass, wing pointedness, amount of subcutaneous fat, wing shape, wing loading, wing aspect ratio, ",

Although these interactions may rule the features of an infracommunity and may shape the infracommunity response to external perturbations, the resilience of ectoparasite communities to new infestations remains poorly explored. Methods: We analysed the composition of the ectoparasite communities found on 214 individual Iberian ibexes (Capra pyrenaica) inhabiting the Sierra Nevada Natural Space, southern Spain. Using classification and regression trees, we explored how the presence of Sarcoptes scabiei (a highly contagious mite), the off-host environment and the host sex govern the prevalence and abundance of lice and ticks. Null model analysis was applied to assess the impact of S. scabiei on the structure of the ectoparasite communities. Results: Our results suggest that S. scabiei infestation acts in tandem with off-host environment and host sex to define the prevalence and abundance of lice and ticks. We also provided evidence for differences in species co-occurrence only at the early stages of S. scabiei infestation. Regarding species diversity, we recorded that ectoparasite communities in scabietic ibexes reached a high richness faster than those in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Even though we show that ectoparasite burden is correlated with S. scabiei infestation, off-host environment and host sex, the species response to S. scabiei infestation and climate seem to be highly variable and influenced by ectoparasite life-history traits. Ectoparasite communities also appear resilient to perturbations which is in agreement with what was previously reported for endoparasites.

However, an acknowledged limitation of traditional models is that the inferred relationships are correlational, cannot easily distinguish direct from indirect determinants of disease risk, and are often considerable simplifications of complex interrelationships. This may be particularly important when attempting to infer causality in patterns of co-infection through pathogen-facilitation. Methods: We describe analyses of cross-sectional data using structural equation models (SEMs), a contemporary advancement on traditional regression approaches, based on our study system of feline gammaherpesvirus (FcaGHV1) in domestic cats. Results: SEMs strongly supported a latent (host phenotype) variable associated with FcaGHV1 exposure and co-infection risk, suggesting these individuals are simply more likely to become infected with multiple pathogens. However, indications of pathogen-covariance (potential facilitation) were also variably detected: potentially among FcaGHV1, Bartonella spp and Mycoplasma spp. Conclusions: Our models suggest multiple exposures are primarily driven by host phenotypic traits, such as aggressive male phenotypes, and secondarily by pathogen-pathogen interactions.

Some differences in eggshell coloration have been reported to co-vary with various measures of maternal condition and these patterns support the hypothesis that, in some bird species, several aspects of eggshell colour (i.e. primary chroma and brightness) function as a signal of maternal and offspring quality to induce greater paternal investment. We directly quantified eggshell pigment concentrations of blackbird Turdus merula and song thrush T. philomelos eggshells and tested how the two key pigments (protoporphyrin IX and biliverdin) co-varied with other eggshell traits and egg constituents as measures of maternal reproductive investment, including total yolk carotenoid concentration, total lipid concentration, yolk mass, and shell thickness. Contrary to predictions, we detected few statistical patterns overall. We found that protoporphyrin IX concentration was negatively associated with blue-green chroma in blackbirds but not in song thrush. The concentration of protoporphyrin IX was significantly greater in blackbirds and also showed different patterns of association with total yolk lipids and yolk carotenoid concentrations between these two species (significant species interaction terms). Our results reveal that it is not appropriate to simply assume in these two avian species that reflectance-based eggshell colour measures are a suitable proxy for eggshell pigment concentrations or can be used as consistent predictors of maternal reproductive investment.

"Castellanos, MC; Verdu, M",2012,Meta-analysis of meta-analyses in plant evolutionary ecology,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"After two decades of meta-analyses on plant traits, we can now look for global emergent patterns in plant evolutionary ecology. Hundreds of meta-analyses have focused on the effects of specific selection pressures on plant fitness, and the buildup of such results allows us to ask general questions regarding selection pressures and plant responses, a major focus of evolutionary ecology. Plant traits are affected by both abiotic and biotic factors. For example, biotic pressures like herbivory may affect physiological (i.e. secondary defences) and reproductive (i.e. seed predation) traits. Similarly, abiotic pressures such as increased CO2 may affect both plant physiology and reproduction. We tested whether biotic or abiotic selective pressures are more important for plant traits, and if the strength of the response to those pressures depends on the plant trait studied by meta-analyzing published meta-analyses on plant responses. We classify meta-analyses according to the type of response variable studied (fitness and non-fitness traits) and the type of selective pressure examined (biotic or abiotic). Our database showed biases in the meta-analysis literature, for example that the majority of studies are focused on non-fitness traits, i.e. on traits that are not directly related to reproduction or survival, and furthermore, on non-fitness traits under abiotic selection pressures. The meta-meta-analysis showed that the strength of responses to selection depends on the nature of selection (stronger for biotic than for abiotic factors) but, unexpectedly, not on the type of trait under study as previously found. The stronger responses to biotic factors can be explained if biotic selection is more variable in space and time, driven by interactions with other organisms. The relative importance of biotic versus abiotic factors on plant traits has been little studied in the past, and would benefit from more studies and reviews that fill the under-represented combinations of selective pressures and plant traits (i.e. abiotic factors on fitness traits).",10.1007/s10682-012-9562-6,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Catford, JA; Downes, BJ; Gippel, CJ; Vesk, PA",2011,Flow regulation reduces native plant cover and facilitates exotic invasion in riparian wetlands,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"P>1. River regulation and exotic plant invasion threaten riverine ecosystems, and the two often co-occur. By altering water regimes, flow regulation can facilitate plant invasion by providing conditions that directly benefit invading species, or by reducing competition from native species unsuited to the modified conditions. Integrating water and weed management has the potential to limit riparian plant invasion and maximize the ecological benefit of environmental flows. 2. We surveyed plant communities and modelled flood histories of 24 riparian wetlands along the regulated River Murray, south-eastern Australia. There were no suitable control rivers, so we compared modelled pre- and post-regulation hydrological data to quantify hydrological change in the study wetlands. Regression analyses revealed relationships between hydrological modification and cover of native non-weed, native weed and exotic weed groups and 10 individual species. 3. Exotic cover was highest and native non-weed cover lowest in wetlands that had experienced the greatest change in hydrology - a reduction in peak flow. Native weeds did not respond to hydrological modification indicating that exotic species' success was not reliant on their generalist characteristics. 4. By altering habitat filters, hydrological modification caused a decline in amphibious native non-weed species cover and simultaneously provided drier conditions that directly favoured the exotic species group dominated by terrestrial species. Exotic species were potentially further assisted by human-mediated dispersal. 5. Species and functional diversity was inversely related to exotic cover. By shifting the balance between native and exotic taxa and changing community functional composition, flow regulation may disrupt the ecological function and ecosystem services of floodplain wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Worldwide, flow regulation has led to riverine ecosystems becoming more terrestrial. The success of most introduced plants relies on minimal inundation. In this study, flood magnitude was more important than frequency, timing, or duration for wetland flora because it reflects spatial extent and depth of flooding. Augmenting natural spring floods with environmental flows will kill terrestrial weeds and facilitate native macrophyte growth. Combined with strategies for managing particular amphibious weeds, we recommend flows of 117 000-147 000 ML day-1 for at least 2 days every 10 years for River Murray wetland weed management.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01945.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

This study meets the call for addressing how life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish to future CO2 levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO2 levels by IPCC for 2050-2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries, upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher pCO(2) values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103 contrasts on 21 fish species using pCO(2) levels well above IPCC projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO2 emission scenarios, we found multiple CO2-dose-dependent effects on calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO2 and far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO2 levels well above IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification, while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO2 exposures in short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO2 levels considered, some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services.",10.1002/ecm.1297/full,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Metanalysis,Marine,Fish,Broad,1,0,1,1,1,"Physiological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,0,F,1,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = life stage, physiology (stenohaline or euryhaline), climatic zone inhabited, adult habitat.

"Cavalieri, LF; Kocak, H",1999,Comparative dynamics of three models for host-parasitoid interactions in a patchy environment,BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY,"Phenomenological models represent a simplified approach to the study of complex systems such as host-parasitoid interactions. In this paper we compare the dynamics of three phenomenological models for host-parasitoid interactions developed by May (1978), May and Hassell (1981) and May et al. (1981). The essence of the paper by May and Hassell ( 1981) was to define a minimum number of parameters that would describe the interactions, avoiding the technical difficulties encountered when using models that involve many parameters, yet yielding a system of equations that could capture the essence of real world interactions in patchy environments. Those studies dealt primarily with equilibrium and coexistence phenomena. Here we study the dynamics through bifurcation analysis and phase pot-traits in a much wider range of parameter values, carrying the models beyond equilibrium states. We show that the dynamics can be either stable or chaotic depending on the location of a damping term in the equations. In the case of the stable system, when host density dependence acts first, a stable point is reached, followed by a closed invariant curve in phase space that first increases then decreases, finally returning to an asymptotically stable point. Chaos is not seen. On the other hand, when parasitoid attack occurs before host density dependence, chaos is inevitably apparent. We show, as did May et al. ( 1981) and stated earlier by Wang and Gutierrez ( 1980), that the sequence of events in host-parasitoid interactions is crucial in determining their stability. In a chaotic state the size of the host (e.g., insect pests) population becomes unpredictable, frequently becoming quite large, a biologically undesirable outcome. From a mathematical point of view the system is of interest because it reveals how a strategically placed damping term can dramatically alter the outcome. Our study, reaching beyond equilibrium states, suggests a strategy for biological control different from that of May et al. (1981).

Small-sized teleost fish, occurring in fragmented populations under contrasting environments, have been widely used as study models to investigate these issues. In the present study, the Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus was used to investigate the relationships between some habitat features and life history strategy. We selected four sites in the Venice lagoon inhabited by this species, exhibiting different combinations of two factors: overall adult mortality, related to intertidal water coverage and a consequent higher level of predator exposure, and the level of sediment organic matter, as indicator of habitat trophic richness. Results showed that these were the two most important factors influencing demography and life history traits in the four sites. Fish from salt marshes with high predator pressure were smaller and produced a higher number of eggs, whereas bigger fish and a lower reproductive investment were found in the two closed, not tidally influenced habitats. Habitat richness was positively related with population density, but negatively related with growth rate. In particular the synergy between high resources and low predation level was found to be important in shaping peculiar life history traits. Results were discussed in the light of the interactions between selective demographic forces acting differentially on age/size classes, such as predation, and habitat trophic richness that may represent an important energetic constraint on life history traits. The importance to link habitat productivity and morphology to demographic factors for a better understanding of the evolution of life history strategy under contrasting environments was finally suggested.

The interaction network analysed exhibited a nested structure, an even distribution of interactions, and low specialization, properties shared with other obligated vascular epiphyte-host tree networks with a different assemblage structure. Interaction frequencies were predicted by the abundance of species, tree size and tree bark texture. Species abundance and tree size also predicted nestedness. Abundance indicated that abundant species interact more frequently; and tree size was an important predictor, since larger-diameter trees hosted more vascular epiphyte species than small-diameter trees. This is one of the first studies analyzing interactions between vascular epiphytes and host trees using a network approach in a subtropical forest, and taking the whole vascular epiphyte assemblage of the sampled community into account.

Despite the absence of dispersal barriers, we expected a clear separation of the phytoplankton communities between basins based on their physical distinctions: a shallow and a deep basin with low and high water residence time, respectively. To investigate seasonal succession and spatiality, taxa were classified according to their functional groups (FGs) and traits (FTs). Relationships between functional classifications and environmental parameters were assessed by non-metric multidimensional scaling integrated with cluster analysis.

"Ceradini, JP; Chalfoun, AD",2017,Species' traits help predict small mammal responses to habitat homogenization by an invasive grass,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Invasive plants can negatively affect native species, however, the strength, direction, and shape of responses may vary depending on the type of habitat alteration and the natural history of native species. To prioritize conservation of vulnerable species, it is therefore critical to effectively predict species' responses to invasive plants, which may be facilitated by a framework based on species' traits. We studied the population and community responses of small mammals and changes in habitat heterogeneity across a gradient of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover, a widespread invasive plant in North America. We live-trapped small mammals over two summers and assessed the effect of cheatgrass on native small mammal abundance, richness, and species-specific and trait-based occupancy, while accounting for detection probability and other key habitat elements. Abundance was only estimated for the most common species, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). All species were pooled for the trait-based occupancy analysis to quantify the ability of small mammal traits (habitat association, mode of locomotion, and diet) to predict responses to cheatgrass invasion. Habitat heterogeneity decreased with cheatgrass cover. Deer mouse abundance increased marginally with cheatgrass. Species richness did not vary with cheatgrass, however, pocket mouse (Perognathus spp.) and harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys spp.) occupancy tended to decrease and increase, respectively, with cheatgrass cover, suggesting a shift in community composition. Cheatgrass had little effect on occupancy for deer mice, 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), and Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). Species' responses to cheatgrass primarily corresponded with our a priori predictions based on species' traits. The probability of occupancy varied significantly with a species' habitat association but not with diet or mode of locomotion. When considered within the context of a rapid habitat change, such as caused by invasive plants, relevant species' traits may provide a useful framework for predicting species' responses to a variety of habitat disturbances. Understanding which species are likely to be most affected by exotic plant invasion will help facilitate more efficient, targeted management and conservation of native species and habitats.",10.1002/eap.1535/full,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Mammals,Grassland,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,0,0,,,0,E,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = habitat preference, diet (omnivore vs. insectivore vs. granivore), locomotion.

Functional traits are commonly used in predictive models that link environmental drivers and community structure to ecosystem functioning. A prerequisite is to identify robust sets of continuous axes of trait variation, and to understand the ecological and evolutionary constraints that result in the functional trait space occupied by interacting species. Despite their diversity and role in ecosystem functioning, little is known of the constraints on the functional trait space of invertebrate biotas of entire biogeographic regions.2. We examined the ecological strategies and constraints underlying the realized trait space of aquatic invertebrates, using data on 12 functional traits of 852 taxa collected in tank bromeliads from Mexico to Argentina. Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce trait dimensionality to significant axes of trait variation, and the proportion of potential trait space that is actually occupied by all taxa was compared to null model expectations. Permutational Analyses of Variance were used to test whether trait combinations were clade-dependent.3. The major axes of trait variation represented life-history strategies optimizing resource use and antipredator adaptations. There was evidence for trophic, habitat, defence and life-history niche axes. Bromeliad invertebrates only occupied 16%-23% of the potential space within these dimensions, due to greater concentrations than predicted under uniform or normal distributions. Thus, despite high taxonomic diversity, invertebrates only utilized a small number of successful ecological strategies.4. Empty areas in trait space represented gaps between major phyla that arose from biological innovations, and trait combinations that are unviable in the bromeliad ecosystem. Only a few phylogenetically distant genera were neighbouring in trait space. Trait combinations aggregated taxa by family and then by order, suggesting that niche conservatism was a widespread mechanism in the diversification of ecological strategies.",10.1111/1365-2435.13141,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Multiple,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits used = max body size, aquatic developmental stage, reprodu ction mode, dispersal mode, resistence forms, respiration mode, locomotion, food, feeding group, cohort production interval, morphological defense, body form.

"Cesar, CP; Frid, CLJ",2012,Benthic disturbance affects intertidal food web dynamics: implications for investigations of ecosystem functioning,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,"Analysis of biological traits within assemblages is increasingly used as a proxy for ecological functioning. However, taxa often show plasticity in the expression of traits and can potentially change trait expression depending on local conditions. While many forms of disturbance will lead to changes in the species composition of the assemblage, small-scale disturbances can trigger alterations in the behaviour of taxa and hence the ecological roles they are delivering. Such changes would not be detected by biological traits analysis (BTA) alone. BTA therefore has the potential to misinform as to the contribution of assemblages to ecological processes. To assess the potential for taxa to change their expression of traits, the feeding modes of 8 taxa from 2 intertidal assemblages in north-west England, UK, were investigated using stable isotope analyses following experimental sediment disturbance and removal of cockles Cerastoderma edule. Two of the 8 taxa exhibited significant changes to their isotopic composition within disturbed plots. Short-term plastic changes to food web dynamics following changes in environmental conditions have implications for the suitability of BTA as a tool for investigating ecosystem function. Although BTA provides much insight into the ecological roles of taxa within systems and can be extremely effective at identifying changes associated with different assemblage compositions, it is conceivable that changes to ecological functioning may be undetected by BTA alone, and hence there is the need for this approach to be supported by experimental observation.",unknown_3,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Broad,intertidal,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits used = feeding mode, diet ",

The study of plantpollinator interactions in a network context is receiving increasing attention. This approach has helped to identify several emerging network patterns such as nestedness and modularity. However, most studies are based only on qualitative information, and some ecosystems, such as deserts and tropical forests, are underrepresented in these data sets. 2. We present an exhaustive analysis of the structure of a 4-year plant-pollinator network from the Monte desert in Argentina using qualitative and quantitative tools. We describe the structure of this network and evaluate sampling completeness using asymptotic species richness estimators. Our goal is to assess the extent to which the realized sampling effort allows for an accurate description of species interactions and to estimate the minimum number of additional censuses required to detect 90% of the interactions. We evaluated completeness of detection of the community-wide pollinator fauna, of the pollinator fauna associated with each plant species and of the plant-pollinator interactions. We also evaluated whether sampling completeness was influenced by plant characteristics, such as flower abundance, flower life span, number of interspecific links (degree) and selectiveness in the identity of their flower visitors, as well as sampling effort. 3. We found that this desert plant-pollinator network has a nested structure and that it exhibits modularity and high network-level generalization. 4. In spite of our high sampling effort, and although we sampled 80% of the pollinator fauna, we recorded only 55% of the interactions. Furthermore, although a 64% increase in sampling effort would suffice to detect 90% of the pollinator species, a fivefold increase in sampling effort would be necessary to detect 90% of the interactions. 5. Detection of interactions was incomplete for most plant species, particularly specialists with a long flowering season and high flower abundance, or generalists with short flowering span and scant flowers. Our results suggest that sampling of a network with the same effort for all plant species is inadequate to sample interactions. 6. Sampling the diversity of interactions is labour intensive, and most plant-pollinator networks published to date are likely to be undersampled.

Although interactions among neighboring species and their inter-specific differences are known drivers of coexistence with a strong spatial signal, assessing the role of individual species on the functional structure of the community at different spatial scales remains a challenge. Here, we ask whether individual species exert a measurable effect on the spatial organization of different functional traits in local assemblages. We first propose and compute two functions that describe different aspects of functional trait organization around individual species at multiple scales: individual weighted mean area relationship and individual functional diversity area relationship. Secondly, we develop a conceptual model on the relationship and simultaneous variation of these two metrics, providing five alternative scenarios in response to the ability of some target species to modify its neighbor environment and the possible assembly mechanisms involved. Our results show that some species influence the spatial structure of specific functional traits, but their effects were always restricted to the finest spatial scales.

To this end, we develop and calibrate a trait-based model for unicellular planktonic organisms characterized by four traits: cell size and investments in phototrophy, nutrient uptake, and phagotrophy. We use the model to predict how optimal trophic strategies depend on cell size under various environmental conditions, including seasonal succession. We identify two mixotrophic strategies: generalist mixotrophs investing in all three investment traits and obligate mixotrophs investing only in phototrophy and phagotrophy. We formulate two conjectures: (1) most cells are limited by organic carbon; however, small unicellulars are colimited by organic carbon and nutrients, and only large photoautotrophs and smaller mixotrophs are nutrient limited; (2) trophic strategy is bottom-up selected by the environment, while optimal size is top-down selected by predation.

Assembly of grassland communities has long been scrutinized through the lens of functional diversity. Studies generally point to an overwhelming influence of climate on observed patterns of functional diversity, despite experimental evidence demonstrating the importance of biotic interactions. We postulate that this is because most observational studies neglect both scale dependencies of assembly processes and phenotypic variation between individuals. Here, we test for changes in the importance of abiotic filtering and biotic interactions along a stress gradient by explicitly accounting for different scales. In addition to quantifying intraspecific trait variability (ITV), we also vary the two components of spatial scale, including grain (i.e. community size) and extent (i.e. the geographical area that defines the species pool). 2. We sampled 20 grassland communities in ten sites distributed along a 975-m elevation gradient. At each site, we measured seven functional traits for a total of 2020 individuals at different spatial grains. We related community functional diversity metrics to the main environmental gradient of our study area, growing season length (GSL), and assessed the dependence of these relationships on spatial grain, spatial extent and ITV. 3. At large spatial grain and extent, the imprint of environmental filtering on functional diversity became more important with increasing stress (i.e. functional diversity decreased with shorter GSL). At small spatial grain and extent, we found a convex relationship between functional diversity and GSL congruent with the hypothesis that competition is dominant at low-stress levels while facilitative interactions are dominant at high-stress levels (i. e. high functional diversity at both extremes of the stress gradient). Importantly, the effect of intraspecific variability on assembly rules was noticeable only at small spatial grain and extent. 4. Synthesis. Our study reveals how the combination of abiotic stress and biotic interactions shapes the functional diversity of alpine grasslands at different spatial scales, and highlights the importance of phenotype variation between individuals for community assembly processes at fine spatial scale.

Methods Our approach gradually constrains null models by: (1) filtering out species not able to survive in the regional conditions in order to reduce the spatial scale, and (2) shuffling species only within lineages of different ages to reduce the evolutionary scale of the analysis. We first tested and validated this approach using simulated communities. We then applied it to study the functional diversity patterns of the leaf-height-seed strategy of plant communities in the French Alps. Results Using simulations, we found that reducing the spatial scale correctly detected a signature of competition (functional divergence) even when environmental filtering produced an overlaying signal of functional convergence. However, constraining the evolutionary scale did not change the identified functional diversity patterns. In the case study of alpine plant communities, investigating scale effects revealed that environmental filtering had a strong influence at larger spatial and evolutionary scales and that neutral processes were more important at smaller scales.

Recently, functional and phylogenetic diversities have been suggested as indicators of these assembly processes. Assuming that diversity is a good proxy for niche overlap, high beta-diversity along environmental gradients should be the result of environmental filtering while low beta-diversity should stem from competitive interactions. So far, studies trying to disentangle the relative importance of these assembly processes have provided mixed results. One reason for this may be that these studies often rely on a single measure of diversity and thus implicitly make a choice on how they account for species relative abundances and how species similarities are captured by functional traits or phylogeny. Here, we tested the effect of gradually scaling the importance of dominance (the weight given to dominant vs. rare species) and species similarity (the weight given to small vs. large similarities) on resulting beta-diversity patterns of an alpine plant meta-community. To this end, we combined recent extensions of the Hill numbers framework with Pagel's phylogenetic tree transformation approach. We included functional (based on the leaf height seed spectrum) and phylogenetic facets of beta-diversity in our analysis and explicitly accounted for effects of environmental and spatial covariates. We found that functional beta-diversity was high when the same weight was given to dominant vs. rare species and to large vs. small species' similarities. In contrast, phylogenetic beta-diversity was low when greater weight was given to dominant species and small species' similarities. Those results suggested that different environments along the gradients filtered different species according to their functional traits, while, the same competitive lineages dominated communities across the gradients. Our results highlight that functional vs. phylogenetic facets, presence-absence vs. abundance structure and different weights of species' dissimilarity provide complementary and important information on the drivers of meta-community structure.

Furthermore, latent heterogeneity in fitness components might be expressed differently in contrasted environmental conditions, an issue that has only rarely been investigated. Here, we assessed (i) the potential existence of latent individual heterogeneity and (ii) the nature of its expression (fixed vs. variable) in a population of female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), using a hierarchical modeling approach on a 30-year mark-recapture data set consisting of 954 individual encounter histories.

Modeling effects of such fluctuations is challenging because prey populations may vary with multiple climate oscillations occurring at different time scales. The analysis of a 28-yr time series of capture-recapture data of a tropical seabird, the Nazca Booby (Sula granti), in the Galapagos, Ecuador, allowed us to test for demographic effects of two major ocean oscillations occurring at distinct time-scales: the inter-annual El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and inter-decadal oscillations. As expected for a tropical seabird, survival of fledgling birds was highly affected by extreme ENSO events; by contrast, neither recruitment nor breeding participation were affected by either ENSO or decadal oscillations. More interesting, adult survival, a demographic trait that canalizes response to environmental variations, was unaffected by inter-annual ENSO oscillations yet was shaped by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and small pelagic fish regime. Adult survival decreased during oceanic conditions associated with higher breeding success, an association probably mediated in this species by costs of reproduction that reduce survival when breeding attempts end later.

To better understand these implications, we develop a non-linear age-structured mathematical model to qualitatively examine the evolutionary consequences of a heritable boldness personality trait within an animal population. We assume that this heritable boldness trait is positively correlated with boldness towards predators and intraspecific aggressiveness. This assumption leads to a growth/reproductive success versus mortality trade-off, which is thoroughly investigated and documented in the literature. Another life-history trade-off we include in the model is future versus current reproduction, which was shown by Wolf et al. [1] to be a possible mechanism for the evolution of behavioural syndromes within an animal population. The stability of the system is analysed, whereby the characteristic equation is in the form of a homogeneous Fredholm equation of the second kind which depends on both the perturbation and equilibrium solution. The system is found to be stable due to the competition between individuals of similar boldness acting as a negative feedback mechanism. Using numerical simulations we examine the qualitative features of the solution to the system. In particular, we investigate the interplay between the mutation and competition strength between two individuals with different boldness, whereby we find that an increasing competition range acts to push individuals to both extremes of the shy-bold axis, while an increasing mutation range counteracts this effect. This qualitative trait of aggregation of individuals around the shy and bold extremes is also found when examining different birth, mortality and competition functions.",10.1371/journal.pone.0084774,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Major pathways in primary metabolism were identified, indicating significant plasticity in autotrophic, heterotrophic, and diazotrophic strategies supporting microbial communities.

"Chandrasegaran, K; Juliano, SA",2019,How Do Trait-Mediated Non-lethal Effects of Predation Affect Population-Level Performance of Mosquitoes?,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Non-lethal, trait-mediated effects of predation impact prey behavior and life-history traits. Studying how these effects in turn influence prey demography is crucial to understand prey life-history evolution. Mosquitoes are important vectors that claim several million lives every year worldwide by transmitting a range of pathogens. Several ecological factors affect life-history traits of both larval and adult mosquitoes, creating effects that cascade to population-level consequences. Few studies have comprehensively explored the non-lethal effects of predation and its interactions with resources and competition on larval, adult, and population traits of mosquitoes. Understanding these interactions is important because the effects of predation are hypothesized to rescue prey populations from the effects of density-dependence resulting from larval competition. Aedes aegypti larvae reared at two different larval densities and subjected to three non-lethal predator treatments were monitored for survival, development time, and adult size through the larval stages to adult eclosion, and adult females were monitored for survival and reproduction through their first gonotrophic cycle. Intraspecific competition increased larval development time, yielded small-bodied adults, and reduced fecundity in individuals exposed to predatory chemical cues as larvae. Exposure to cues from a living predator affected both body size and latency to blood feed in females. Analysis of life-table traits revealed significant effects of competition on net reproductive rate (R-0) of mosquitoes. The interaction between competition and predator treatments significantly affected the cohort rate of increase (r) and the index of performance (r'). The index of performance, which estimates rate of population change based on the size-fecundity relationship, was significantly and positively correlated with r, but overestimated r slightly. Lack of significant effect of predator treatments and larval density on cohort generation time (T-c) further suggests that the observed effects of treatments on r and r' were largely a consequence of the effects on R-0. Also, the significant effects of treatment combinations on larval development time, adult body size and fecundity were ultimately manifested as effects on life-table traits estimated from adult survival and reproduction.",10.3389/fevo.2019.00025,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Broad,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,0,0,0,1,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = median development time, liklihood of survival to adulthood, mean body size, liklihood of females surviving to blood feed, mean number of feeding bouts required to take a blood meal, mean fecundity in the first gonotrophic cycle",

An analysis of a 15-30 year succession series of degraded forest restoration sample plots at the Xiaoliang Research Station for Restoration of Tropical Coastal Degraded Ecosystem was performed to evaluate the patterns in the phylogenetic structure of tropical forest over time in the early stage of succession. In our study, we attempted to determine whether it was possible to predict future variations in the community composition based on the phylogenetic positions of different species. The results showed that the random colonization pattern of pioneer species resulted in the random community phylogenetic structure in the early stage of succession. Subsequently, the rapid development of species with close genetic relationships possess similar traits which were adaptive to the local homogeneous environment resulted in phylogenetic clustering. We also proposed a new method to determine the relationships between the phylogenetic positions of the species in a community and the quantitative dynamics of their populations. The results indicated that species with close initial community phylogenetic positions (lnD << 0) had more related species, high population growth rates, whereas species with relatively unrelated initial community phylogenetic positions (lnD >> 0) had fewer related species, low population growth rates, and even decreased populations.

However, humans have altered the occupancy and abundance patterns of many speciesthe basis upon which we define rarity. Here, we use a globally unique dataset from hydrothermal ventsan untouched ecosystemto test whether rare species over-contribute to functional diversity. LocationJuan de Fuca Ridge hydrothermal vent fields, Northeast Pacific Ocean. MethodsWe first conduct a comprehensive review to set up expectations for the relative contributions of rare and common species to functional diversity. We then quantify the rarity and commonness of 37 vent species with relevant trait information to assess the relationship between rarity and functional distinctivenessa measure of the uniqueness of the traits of a species relative to traits of coexisting species. Next, we randomly assemble communities to test whether rare species over-contribute to functional diversity in artificial assemblages ranging in species richness. Then, we test whether biotic interactions influence functional diversity contributions by comparing the observed contribution of each species to a null expectation. Finally, we identify traits driving functional distinctiveness using a distance-based redundancy analysis. ResultsAcross functional diversity metrics and species richness levels, we find that both rare and common species can contribute functional uniqueness. Some species always offer unique trait combinations, and these species host bacterial symbionts and provide habitat complexity. Moreover, we find that contributions of species to functional diversity may be influenced by biotic interactions. Main conclusionsOur findings show that many common species make persistent, unique contributions to functional diversity.

For an old-growth Appalachian forest, we used path analysis to understand how patterns of tree functional diversity relate to topography and soil gradients and to determine whether topographic effects are mediated through soil chemistry. All of our path models supported the idea of environmental filtering: stressful areas (high elevation, low soil moisture, low soil nutrients) were occupied by communities of low functional diversity, which suggests a selective effect for species with traits adapted to such harsh conditions. The effects of topography (slope, aspect, elevation) on functional diversity were often indirect and moderated through soil moisture and fertility. Soil moisture was a key component of our models and was featured consistently in each one, having either strong direct effects on functional diversity or indirect effects via soil fertility. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the interplay among functional trait assemblages, topography, and edaphic conditions and contribute to the baseline understanding of the role of environmental filtering in temperate forest community assembly.",10.3390/f9010019,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits used = specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, Wood density, Seed mass, and max height.

"Charette, C; Derry, AM",2016,Climate alters intraspecific variation in copepod effect traits through pond food webs,ECOLOGY,"Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are primarily generated by phytoplankton in aquatic ecosystems, and can limit the growth, development, and reproduction of higher consumers. Among the most critical of the EFAs are highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), which are only produced by certain groups of phytoplankton. Changing environmental conditions can alter phytoplankton community and fatty acid composition and affect the HUFA content of higher trophic levels. Almost no research has addressed intraspecific variation in HUFAs in zooplankton, nor intraspecific relationships of HUFAs with body size and fecundity. This is despite that intraspecific variation in HUFAs can exceed interspecific variation and that intraspecific trait variation in body size and fecundity is increasingly recognized to have an important role in food web ecology (effect traits). Our study addressed the relative influences of abiotic selection and food web effects associated with climate change on intraspecific differences and interrelationships between HUFA content, body size, and fecundity of freshwater copepods. We applied structural equation modeling and regression analyses to intraspecific variation in a dominant calanoid copepod, Leptodiatomus minutus, among a series of shallow north-temperate ponds. Climate-driven diurnal temperature fluctuations favored the coexistence of diversity of phytoplankton groups with different temperature optima and nutritive quality. This resulted in unexpected positive relationships between temperature, copepod DHA content and body size. Temperature correlated positively with diatom biovolume, and mediated relationships between copepod HUFA content and body size, and between copepod body size and fecundity. The presence of brook trout further accentuated these positive effects in warm ponds, likely through nutrient cycling and stimulation of phytoplankton resources. Climate change may have previously unrecognized positive effects on freshwater copepod DHA content, body size, and fecundity in the small, shallow bodies of inland waters that are commonly found in north--temperate landscapes.",10.1890/15-0794.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Other,North-Temperate Ponds,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History  ",2,1,0,0,1,,0,F,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,,"Taxonomic = Copepods.

In spite of the attention that this hypothesis has given rise to, the empirical evidence remains sparse, mostly because of the difficulties of controlling for the many environmental factors that may covary with both the paternal phenotype and offspring fitness. Here, we tested the hypothesis that offspring sired by males of a preferred phenotype should have better survival in an endangered bird, the houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata).Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested if natural and experimentally-induced variation in courtship display (following an inflammatory challenge) predicts the survival of offspring. Chicks were produced by artificial insemination of females, ensuring that any effect on survival could only arise from the transfer of paternal genes. One hundred and twenty offspring were equipped with radio transmitters, and their survival monitored in the wild for a year. This allowed assessment of the potential benefits of paternal genes in a natural setting, where birds experience the whole range of environmental hazards. Although natural variation in sire courtship display did not predict offspring survival, sires that withstood the inflammatory insult and maintained their courtship activity sired offspring with the best survival upon release.Conclusions: This finding is relevant both to enlighten the debate on ""good genes'' sexual selection and the management of supportive breeding programs.",10.1371/journal.pone.0025305,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Chattopadhyay, D; Zuschin, M; Tomasovych, A",2014,Effects of a high-risk environment on edge-drilling behavior: inference from Recent bivalves from the Red Sea,PALEOBIOLOGY,"Edge-drilling is an unusual predation pattern in which a predatory gastropod drills a hole on the commissure between the valves of a bivalve. Although it is faster than wall drilling, it involves the potential risk of amputating the drilling organ. We therefore hypothesize that this risky strategy is advantageous only in environments where predators face high competition or predation pressure while feeding. The high frequency of edge-drilling (EDF, relative to the total number of drilled valves) in a diverse Recent bivalve assemblage from the Red Sea enables us to test this hypothesis, predicting (1) a low EDF in infaunal groups, (2) a high EDF in bivalves with elongated shape, (3) high incidence of edge-drilling in groups showing a high wall-drilling frequency, and (4) high EDF in shallow habitats. We evaluate these predictions based on >15,000 bivalve specimens. Among ecological attributes, we found substrate affinity and predation intensity of a species to be good predictors of edge-drilling incidence. Infaunal taxa with high length/width ratio have a low EDF, in accordance with our predictions. Predation intensity is also a significant predictor of edge-drilling; groups with high predation intensity show higher incidence of edge-drilling, confirming our prediction. Although water depth fails to show any significant effect on EDF, this analysis generally supports the high-risk hypothesis of edge-drilling incidence because shallow depths have considerable microhabitat variability. Classically the drill hole site selection has often been linked to predatory behavior. Our study indicates that prey attributes are also crucial in dictating the behavioral traits of a driller such as site selection. This calls for considering such details of the prey to fully understand predation in modern and fossil habitats. Moreover, this perspective is important for tackling the longstanding riddle of the limited temporal and spatial distribution of edge-drilling.",10.1666/13024,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Other,Enclosed Sea,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,"Taxonomic = gastropods.

"Chaves, LF; Harrington, LC; Keogh, CL; Nguyen, AM; Kitron, UD",2010,Blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes: random or structured?,FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY,"Background: The foraging behavior of blood-sucking arthropods is the defining biological event shaping the transmission cycle of vector-borne parasites. It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns. Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases. Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.",10.1186/1742-9994-7-3,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,,

It has been shown that the deposition of calcium carbonate is affected by the ingestion of organic compounds. We hypothesize that organic compounds not synthesized by the snails are important for shell strength and must be obtained from the diet. We tested this idea indirectly by evaluating whether the abundance of the organic matter that snails eat is related to the strength of their shells. We measured shell crushing resistance in the snail Mexipyrgus churinceanus and the abundance of the most common aquatic macrophyte, the water lily Nymphaea ampla, in ten bodies of water in the valley of Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. We used stable isotopes to test the assumption that these snails feed on water lily organic matter. We also measured other factors that can affect crushing resistance, such as the density of crushing predators, snail density, water pH, and the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the water. The isotope analysis suggested that snails assimilate water lily organic matter that is metabolized by sediment bacteria. The variable that best explained the variation in crushing resistance found among sites was the local abundance of water lilies. We propose that the local amount of water lily organic matter provides organic compounds important in shell biomineralization, thus determining crushing resistance. Hence, we propose that a third trophic level could be important in the coevolution of snail defensive traits and predatory structures.",10.1371/journal.pone.0044374,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

To determine the role of pollinators in generating selection effects on floral traits, we compared the phenotypic selection gradients in open-pollinated and hand-pollinated plants. Our results show that pollinator-mediated linear selection on flowering start and correlational selection on the number of flowers and scape height explains most of the net phenotypic selection on these traits suggesting pollinators played an important role in shaping floral diversity.

We used a dataset of 4008 Australian species to provide the first continental-scale tests of a series of hypotheses about the factors that might affect fruit type. We found a significant latitudinal gradient in the proportion of Fleshy-fruited species, with the percentage of fleshy-fruited species rising from 19% at 43.75 degrees S to 49% at 9.25 degrees S. Species bearing fleshy fruits were more frequent on the coastal fringes of Australia, while species bearing non-fleshy fruits became more frequent toward the arid centre. Wet, warm and stable climates favoured fleshy-fruited species, with the two best predictors of the proportion of fleshy-fruited species being maximum precipitation over five days (R-2 = 0.40), and precipitation in the wettest month (R-2 = 0.25). These results remained consistent after accounting for phylogenetic correlation among species. A combined model including variables of precipitation, temperature, and climatic variation explained 67% of the variation in the proportion of fleshy-fruited species. Our results are consistent with the idea that plant reproductive strategies are more often tied to conditions during the parts of the year in which they grow than to conditions during the harsh parts of the year.

However, all previous studies about the latitudinal gradient in seed predation were either based on single species or compiled data from studies that used different methods in different ecosystems. Our goal was to provide the first broad-scale quantification of the latitudinal gradient in seed predation at both cross-species and within-species levels.Location: Twenty-five sites spanning 28 degrees of latitude on the east coast of Australia.Methods: Using consistent protocols, we measured pre-dispersal seed predation for 256 species x site combinations (including a total of 170 species) and post-dispersal seed removal for 126 species x site combinations (including a total of 91 species), as well as removal of standard rice grains at each site. The relationships between seed predation and latitude were quantified using generalized mixed-effects models and meta-analyses.Results: Contrary to expectations, the proportion of seeds lost to pre-dispersal seed predation increased with latitude at the cross-species level and showed no latitudinal trend at the within-species level. There was no significant relationship between latitude and the proportion of seeds lost to post-dispersal seed removal, either within species or across species. We found significantly higher removal of standard rice grains at lower latitudes, but this trend reversed if we excluded the four island sites from analysis.Main conclusions: Seed predation on natural seeds was not higher at lower latitudes. Thus, our study joins a growing body of evidence contrary to the idea that tropical species suffer greater losses to herbivores than do temperate species. The latitudinal gradient in removal rates for standard rice grains suggests that natural seeds from low latitudes may have achieved a similar predation rate to high-latitudinal species through increased investment in defenses.

Understanding how traits evolved among coexisting species helps to infer community assembly processes. We propose fatty acid composition in consumer tissue as a functional trait related to both food resources and physiological functions of species. We measured phylogenetic signal in fatty acid profiles of 13 field-sampled Collembola (springtail) species and then combined the data with published fatty acid profiles of another 24 species. Collembola fatty acid profiles generally showed phylogenetic signal, with related species resembling each other. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, related to physiological functions, demonstrated phylogenetic signal. In contrast, most food resource biomarker fatty acids and the ratios between bacterial, fungal, and plant biomarker fatty acids exhibited no phylogenetic signal. Presumably, fatty acids related to physiological functions have been constrained during Collembola evolutionary history: Species with close phylogenetic affinity experienced similar environments during divergence, while niche partitioning in food resources among closely related species favored species coexistence. Measuring phylogenetic signal in ecologically relevant traits of coexisting species provides an evolutionary perspective to contemporary assembly processes of ecological communities.

Seventy seven out of 83 species collected were classified under four ecological groups based on the life-history traits and sensitivity to organic gradients. The mean ATZI marine biotic index (AMBI) derived from these ecological groups showed spatial difference among the five sampling locations. In particular, the presence of different percentages of polychaete species from Groups III (unbalanced community) and IV (polluted community) suggested the presence of pollution stress in certain degree at all sampling locations. However, no significant temporal changes were noted over the study period. From all polychaete species identified, they were classified into 13 feeding guilds. The mean diversity of these feeding guilds at most of the sampling locations was significantly higher than that at one of the inside-harbour locations. The composition of feeding guilds was also significantly different spatially. At one of the inside-harbour locations, the dominant feeding guilds were motile/discretely motile surface deposit feeders with tentaculates or unarmed pharynx, and motile omnivores with jawed pharynx in the first year of study, but were replaced by motile, jawed carnivores in the second year of study. The increased proportion of carnivores over the study period can be seen as a sign of recovery in the community structure since abundance of predators is commonly higher in habitats with better environmental quality.

In three different experiments (totaling 121 individuals) we used image analysis to measure body size and four wing traits among newly-emerged butterflies prior to flight trials: wing area, aspect ratio (length/width), melanism, and orange hue. Results showed that monarchs with darker orange (approaching red) wings flew longer distances than those with lighter orange wings in analyses that controlled for sex and other morphometric traits. This finding is consistent with past work showing that among wild monarchs, those sampled during the fall migration are darker in hue (redder) than non-migratory monarchs. Together, these results suggest that pigment deposition onto wing scales during metamorphosis could be linked with traits that influence flight, such as thorax muscle size, energy storage or metabolism.

This study re-assesses evolutionary relationships within heliothines, providing an improved phylogeny and classification to support ongoing intensive research on heliothine genomics, systematics, and biology. Our phylogeny estimate is based on two nuclear gene regions, namely elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha; 1240 bp) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC; 687 bp), and on the barcoding region of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI; 708 bp), providing a total of 2635 bp. These were sequenced for 71 heliothines, representing all major genera and nearly all recognized subgenera and species groups, and for 16 outgroups representing all major lineages of trifine Noctuidae. Analysis of the combined data by maximum likelihood, unweighted parsimony and Bayesian methods gave nearly identical topologies, and the individual gene trees showed only one case of potentially strong conflict. Relationships among genera and subgenera are resolved with strong bootstrap support. The earliest-diverging lineages (c. 200 species in total) consist almost entirely of host specialists, reflecting the inferred ancestral heliothine host range under parsimony. The remaining species form a clade - the Heliothis group - that includes most of the polyphages (30% of heliothines) and all of the major pests. Many other species in the Heliolhis group, however, are host specialists. Our results extend previous efforts to subdivide this large clade, and show the most notorious pest groups, the corn earworm complex (Helicoverpa) and the tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) group, to be closely related, joining with a small oligophagous genus in what we term the major-pest lineage. Thus, genomic/experimental results from one model pest may extrapolate well to other pest species. The frequency of evolutionary expansion and contraction in host range appears to increase dramatically at the base of the Heliothis group, in contrast to the case for earlier-diverging lineages. We ascribe this difference provisionally to differential evolutionary constraints arising from contrasting life-history syndromes.

Bulk sequencing was conducted on some 800 individuals of Diptera obtained by canopy fogging of a single tree in Borneo dominated by small (<1.5mm) individuals. Specimens were split into five body size classes for DNA extraction, to equalize read numbers across specimens and to study how body size, a key ecological trait, interacts with species and phylogenetic diversity. Genome assembly produced 304 orthologous mitochondrial contigs presumed to each represent a different species. The small-bodied fraction was the by far most species-rich (187 contigs). Identification of contigs was through phylogenetic analysis together with 56 reference mitogenomes, which placed most of the Bornean community into seven clades of small-bodied species, indicating phylogenetic conservation of body size. Mapping of shotgun reads against the mitogenomes showed wide ranges of read abundances within each size class. Ranked read abundance plots were largely log-linear, indicating a uniformly filled abundance spectrum, especially for small-bodied species. Small-bodied species differed greatly from other size classes in neutral metacommunity parameters, exhibiting greater levels of immigration, besides greater total community size. We suggest that the established uses of mitochondrial metagenomics for analysis of species and phylogenetic diversity can be extended to parameterize recent theories of community ecology and biodiversity, and by focusing on the number mitochondria, rather than individuals, a new theoretical framework for analysis of mitochondrial abundance spectra can be developed that incorporates metabolic activity approximated by the count of mitochondria.",10.1111/mec.14258,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

The analysis of functional diversity can improve our understanding of these dynamics by identifying community assembly processes. Aims: We studied the effect of environment-community covariations on both functional diversity and functional structure of xerophytic shrub communities for inferring the community assembly processes shaping this vegetation type. Methods: Functional diversity was quantified using (1) community-weighted mean of the studied traits, (2) functional groups, defined using Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering method and (3) Rao's quadratic entropy. Relationships between functional diversity and environmental gradients were identified by Spearman correlations and modelled using generalised additive models. Results: Variations in community composition and functional diversity correlated with soil nutrient availability and aridity. Increasing nutrient availability resulted in both greater average plant height and higher abundance of plants with green photosynthetic organ colour, whereas the abundance of nanophanerophytes increases with aridity.

In this study, we analyzed species and phylogenetic diversity and community structures for woody and herbaceous plants along two elevational transects on Mt. Baekhwa, South Korea. The species richness and phylogenetic diversity of woody plants showed monotonic declining patterns with increasing elevation along all transects, whereas herbaceous plants showed different patterns, such as no relationship and a reversed unimodal pattern, between the study transects. The main drivers of these patterns were climate and habitat variables for woody and herbaceous plants, respectively. In addition, the phylogenetic community structure primarily showed phylogenetic clustering regulated by deterministic processes, especially environmental filtering, such as climate or habitat factors, along the two transects, although herbaceous plants along a transect depicted phylogenetic randomness as a result of a neutral process.

"Ciccarelli, D",2015,Mediterranean coastal dune vegetation: Are disturbance and stress the key selective forces that drive the psammophilous succession?,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"Plant communities of coastal dunes are distributed along a characteristic sea-inland gradient. Generally, there is a shift from annual and short height species with small leaves in the initial successional stages to perennial tall shrubs with tough leaves in later phases. Assessing the community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values is used in plant ecology to describe ecosystem properties especially during succession. In particular, CSR (Competitive, Stress-tolerant, and Ruderal strategy) classification allows us to explore community functional shifts in terms of disturbance, stress and competition selective forces. The functional basis of the psammophilous succession was studied based on the following questions: (1) Can we circumscribe different functional types among plant species of Mediterranean coastal dunes? (2) How do CWM trait values vary along the environmental sea-inland gradient? (3) What is the relative importance of competition, stress and disturbance in the processes of plant community assembling? (4) Can we postulate that along primary successions there is generally a shift from ruderality to stress-tolerance? An explorative analysis of functional groups was performed by Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysing nine morpho-functional traits measured for 45 taxa from 880 dune plots localised in Tuscany (central Italy, Europe). NMDS ordination showed a scattered distribution of psammophytes that could not be delimited in precise plant functional types. The first NMDS axis has been interpreted as a leaf economics axis because it was correlated to leaf area (LA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), while the second one was a plant size axis because of its correlation with canopy height. Along the sea-inland gradient, pioneer plant communities of upper beach were dominated by ruderals (with the lowest values of LDMC and specific leaf area - SLA), well-adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of coastal dunes. More distant from the sea, where ecological conditions were less extreme, late-successional communities of backdunes were characterised by the prevalence of stress-tolerance. This study suggested that psammophytes have evolved not a single but multiple adaptive strategies showing a high degree of functional diversity and complexity. Moreover, CSR classification supported the hypothesis of a functional shift from R-strategists in early successional stages to S-strategists in late-successional communities along a primary succession.

We first assess the direct epidemiological consequences of supplementation, highlighting the similarities and differences between food provisioning and two widespread forms of nutrient input: agricultural fertilization and aquatic nutrient enrichment. We then review an aquatic disease system and a general model to assess whether predator and competitor species can enhance or overturn the direct effects of enrichment. All forms of supplementation can directly affect epidemics by increasing host population size or altering parasite production within hosts, but food provisioning is most likely to aggregate hosts and increase parasite transmission. However, if predators or competitors increase in response to supplementation, they could alter resource-fuelled outbreaks in focal hosts. We recommend identifying the traits of hosts, parasites or interacting species that best predict epidemiological responses to supplementation and evaluating the relative importance of these direct and indirect mechanisms. Theory and experiments should examine the timing of behavioural, physiological and demographic changes for realistic, variable scenarios of supplementation.

Species interactions have long been thought to be key drivers of trait evolution. However, models for comparative data that account for interactions between species are lacking. One of the challenges is that such models are intractable and difficult to express analytically. Here we present phylogenetic models of trait evolution that include interspecific competition among chosen species. Competition is modeled as a tendency of sympatric species to evolve toward difference from one another, producing trait overdispersion and high phylogenetic signal. The model predicts elevated trait variance across species and a slowdown in evolutionary rate both across the clade and within each branch. The model also predicts a reduction in correlation between otherwise correlated traits. We use an approximate Bayesian computation approach to estimate model parameters. We find reasonable power to detect competition in sufficiently large (20 + species) trees compared with Brownian trait evolution and with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and early burst models. We apply the model to examine the evolution of bill morphology of Darwin's finches and find evidence that competition affects the evolution of bill length.",10.1086/689819,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Classen, Alice; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf; Kindeketa, William J.; Peters, Marcell K.",2017,Integrating intraspecific variation in community ecology unifies theories on body size shifts along climatic gradients,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Physiological and energetic mechanisms have been proposed to constrain body sizes of organisms along climatic gradients; however, these provide contrasting predictions. While Bergmann's rule predicts increases in body sizes in cooler climates resulting from physiological constraints, energy-based community assembly rules suggest declines in the mean body size of species caused by increased extinction probabilities for large-bodied species in low-energy habitats. We tested these contrasting hypotheses by quantifying trait distributions in bee communities along a 36-km elevational gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro. Traditionally, intra- and interspecific trait shifts along environmental gradients have been investigated in isolation. However, a surge of theoretical approaches and studies on plants demonstrated that the explicit integration of trait variation among and within species can be essential for identifying the mechanisms that shape traits and related ecosystem functions along environmental gradients. We therefore studied variation in body size and related morphological traits at both the intra- and interspecific level. We found support for both physiological constraints and energy-based community assembly rules as drivers of trait distribution in bee communities along elevational gradients, which, however, affected different levels of biotic organization, that is the population and community level. While the number of bee species with large body sizes declined with elevation, individuals within species became on average larger, resulting in contrasting trends in morphometric parameters at the community versus population level. Furthermore, body size within bee communities became less variable at higher elevations, largely as a result of a non-random, directive loss of species, but paralleled by a decline in intraspecific variance, suggesting intensified filtering effects with increasing elevation. Similar patterns were found for other functional traits related to the foraging ecology of bees (tongue length, relative forewing length). We conclude that along climatic gradients both physiological and energetic constraints shape trait distributions of pollinators, but at different levels of biological organization.",10.1111/1365-2435.12786,y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,1,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = body size, relative forewing length, glossa length",

Community assembly theories predict that the success of invading species into a new community should be predictable by functional traits. Environmental filters could constrain the number of successful ecological strategies in a habitat, resulting in similar suites of traits between native and successfully invading species (convergence). Conversely, concepts of limiting similarity and competitive exclusion predict native species will prevent invasion by functionally similar exotic species, resulting in trait divergence between the two species pools. Nutrient availability may further alter the strength of convergent or divergent forces in community assembly, by relaxing environmental constraints and/or influencing competitive interactions. 2. To investigate how nutrient availability influences forces of divergence and convergence during the invasion of exotic species into native communities, we conducted multivariate analyses of community composition and functional traits from naturally assembled plant communities in long-term nitrogen (N) addition experiments across North America. 3. Relative abundances of key functional traits differed between the native and exotic plant communities, consistent with limiting similarity or a trait bias in the exotic species pool. Environmental context also played an important role in invasion because sites varied in the identity of the traits that predicted dissimilarity between native and exotic communities. Nitrogen enrichment did not alter these patterns. 4. Nitrogen enrichment tended to increase exotic abundance, but this result was driven by a dramatic increase in exotics in only a few experiments. When similarity between native and exotic communities was included in the statistical model, N enrichment no longer predicted an increase in exotic relative abundance. Instead, sites with the highest abundance of exotic species were the ones where native and exotic communities had the highest trait similarity. 5. Synthesis. Our analysis of natural patterns of invasion across herbaceous communities in North America found evidence of both divergent and convergent forces on community assembly with exotic species. Together, these results suggest that while functionally dissimilar exotic species may be more likely to invade, they are unlikely to become abundant unless they have traits pre-adapting them to environmental conditions in their invaded range.

We investigated phylogenetic turnover and functional gene composition of saprotrophic fungi along a 4000-year glacial chronosequence. A direct relationship between -diversity and geographic distance, a proxy for time since deglaciation, indicated that dispersal limitation shapes saprotrophic fungal communities. Further, we infer that dispersal limitation may also influence fungal functional properties as metabolic potential and functional richness increased with site age. Despite attempts to minimize environmental variation, a direct relationship between -diversity and biogeochemical differences across sites indicated that environmental filtering further shapes fungal community composition. However, environmental filtering was overshadowed by the effect of dispersal limitation when tested by multiple regression. Fungal -diversity and composition of functional genes involved in plant litter decay were unrelated, suggesting that functional traits are not phylogenetically conserved across this chronosequence.

The NVH has important ecological and evolutionary implications but has been controversial since its inception. Recent interpretations have supported the NVH by directly comparing among-individual diet variation with population dietary niche breadth. Traditional studies of the NVH focused on morphological traits as proxies of niche variation, with contradictory results. Gape-limited predators may be relatively likely to show effects of morphological variation on diet breadth because gape size can strongly limit diet. We used five anurans to test NVH predictions, including three true frogs, Rana catesbeiana, R. clamitans, and R. sphenocephala, and two toads, Anaxyrus americanus and A. fowleri. We combined recent and traditional approaches by comparing both individual variation in diet and variation in gape width with dietary niche breadth. We found support for the NVH within two species of the three true frogs but not for either toad species, a difference likely driven by greater strength of the feeding limitation caused by gape width in the frogs. Toads had higher gape width to snout-vent length ratios, reducing the strength of the feeding limitation imposed by gape width. We found strong support for the NVH among species; species with more among-individual variation in diet and species with more variation in gape width had broader niches.

Even closely related animals often differ in their fear of humans and/or novelty, their behavioural responses to pain; and when captive, their overall welfare and the form and frequency of their stereotypies. Such species differences stimulate hypotheses about 1) the way that responses to challenge co-vary with other biological traits, 2) the adaptive value of particular responses, and 3) the factors predicting responses to evolutionarily new scenarios, such as captivity. We illustrate how these ideas can be statistically tested with multi-species comparisons, and show how techniques such as the Comparative Analysis of Independent Contrasts can be used to control for any non-independence of data points caused by species' relatedness. For each of the three types of hypothesis, we then provide several welfare-relevant examples including one that has been fully tested (respectively, the relationships between sociality and anti-predator behaviour in antelopes, predation pressure, foraging niche and neophobia in parrots, and home range size and stereotypy in carnivores). Ultimate explanations such as these, based on species' ecology and evolutionary history, have great explanatory appeal. Species comparisons can also have great practical value, allowing the test of hypotheses that would be almost impossible to investigate experimentally, and generating principles that allow predictions about the welfare of similar unstudied species.

Understanding individual diet specialization empirically requires the ability to quantify individual diet preferences accurately. Here we compare the currently used frequentist maximum likelihood approach, which infers individual preferences using the observed prey proportions to Bayesian hierarchical models that instead estimate these proportions. Using simulated and empirical data, we find that the approach of using observed prey proportions consistently overestimates diet specialization relative to the Bayesian hierarchical approach when the number of prey observations per individual is low or the number of prey observations vary among individuals, two common features of empirical data. Furthermore, the Bayesian hierarchical approach permits the estimation of point estimates for both prey proportions and their variability within and among levels of organization (i.e., individuals, experimental treatments, populations), while also characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates in ways inaccessible to frequentist methods.

Studies using isogenic animal populations exposed to a stress paradigm could elucidate the relative contributions of genotype and environment to endophenotypic expression. The prevalence of individuals displaying severely compromised behavioural responses to predator scent stress (PSS) was assessed in six inbred strains of mice in an animal model of PTSD that classifies individuals into groups according to the degree of their behavioural response. The choice of strains was based on the frequent use of these mice in transgenic research. The prevalence of extreme behavioural response in the elevated plus maze and the acoustic startle response paradigms, performed in sequence, was assessed at baseline and 7 d after PSS exposure between and within strains, and compared to differences in circulating corticosterone levels. Narrow-sense trait heritability was determined by comparing the between-strain variance to the total variance. Although strain-specific differences in anxiety-like behaviours were demonstrated, the results revealed a significant degree of individual variability in response patterns within each of the inbred strains, yielding a baseline heritability factor for anxiety-like behaviours of 30%, but only 10% for response to stress exposure. Baseline anxiety-like behaviours were found not to be predictive of post-exposure behavioural responses.

"Colautti, RI; Lau, JA",2015,"Contemporary evolution during invasion: evidence for differentiation, natural selection, and local adaptation",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Biological invasions are natural' experiments that can improve our understanding of contemporary evolution. We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently inferred, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation is only marginally lower (similar to 3.5%) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by nonrandom geographic sampling; simulations suggest this causes a high false-positive discovery rate (>50%) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (|s|) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (||) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that nonadaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization (similar to two-thirds of simulations). Additionally, Q(ST)-F-ST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species.

We tested for stabilizing selection and the effect of growing environment on 13 populations of the invasive plant Lythrum salicaria sampled along a latitudinal gradient. Plants were grown under uniform glasshouse conditions and in a 3-year common garden field experiment at midlatitude. Consistent with model assumptions, the ranking of population means was highly correlated across the 3 years, and with glasshouse measurements, despite significant interannual differences in flowering time and vegetative size. As predicted, the first principal component (PC1) of flowering time and size was under stabilizing selection, and directional selection was detected on PC2, thus favoring plants that flowered earlier at a larger size.

The objective classification of 68 species on this basis, using multivariate analyses, identified seven distinct ecological groups that were primarily determined by size, diel activity and diet (e.g. large Carabus spp., nocturnal plant feeders and species feeding on Collembola). The influence of agricultural land use and management intensity on these ecological groups was then investigated. The percentage of both Carabus spp. and individuals was greater on heather moorland and semi-natural grassland sites than in intensively managed arable or grassland sites. The percentage of Carabus spp. was also adversely affected by intensive agricultural management. A higher percentage of carabids feed specifically on Collembola in intensive grassland sites than in arable or semi-natural grassland sites suggesting that Collembola were more available in intensive grassland. This study introduces a non-taxonomic method of classifying carabids on the basis of their ecology. Such classification methods not only enable influences of agriculture to be detected across broad ecological groups rather than being reliant on the presence of a few key indicator species, but may also help in predicting how such changes to the community structure may influence ecosystem functioning.

Besides a conservation value per se, biodiversity is related to the services that ecosystems provide to society and the ability of these to cope with stressors, including climate change. Using macro-invertebrates and fish as sentinel organisms, this overview presents a synthesis of the state of the art in the application of biomarkers (stress and enzymatic responses, endocrine disruptors, trophic tracers, energy and bile metabolites, genotoxic indicators, histopathological and behavioural alterations, and genetic and cutting edge omic markers) to determine the causes and effects of anthropogenic stressors on the biodiversity of European Mediterranean rivers. We also discuss how a careful selection of sentinel species according to their ecological traits and the food-web structure of Mediterranean rivers could increase the ecological relevance of biomarker responses. Further, we provide suggestions to better harmonise ecological realism with experimental design in biomarker studies, including statistical analyses, which may also deliver a more comprehensible message to managers and policy makers. By keeping on the safe side the health status of populations of multiple-species in a community, we advocate to increase the resilience of fluvial ecosystems to face present and forecasted stressors.

Other studies dealt with the accumulation of pollution through the food web, the impact of aquaculture or the ecosystem effects of climate change. They contributed to the scientific aspects of an ecosystem-based approach in the region because they integrated human activities within an ecosystem context and evaluated their impact on the marine food web, including environmental factors.

Moreover, our analysis evidenced the importance of top predators and small pelagic fish in Mediterranean ecosystems, in addition to the structural role of benthos and plankton organisms. The impact of fishing was high and of a similar intensity in the western, central and eastern regions and showed differences between ecosystem types.

We describe the primary functionality of ECOIND and provide an example of its application in both static and temporal-spatial dynamic modelling, while we highlight several related features including a new taxonomy input database (species traits) and the ability to analyse input uncertainty on output results.

This creates uncertainty about the roles of fish and other consumers in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem processes, the extent of human and environmental impacts and fishery potential. We develop and use a size-based macroecological model to assess the effects of parameter uncertainty on predicted consumer biomass, production and distribution. Resulting uncertainty is large (e.g. median global biomass 4.9 billion tonnes for consumers weighing 1 g to 1000 kg; 50% uncertainty intervals of 2 to 10.4 billion tonnes; 90% uncertainty intervals of 0.3 to 26.1 billion tonnes) and driven primarily by uncertainty in trophic transfer efficiency and its relationship with predator-prey body mass ratios. Even the upper uncertainty intervals for global predictions of consumer biomass demonstrate the remarkable scarcity of marine consumers, with less than one part in 30 million by volume of the global oceans comprising tissue of macroscopic animals. Thus the apparently high densities of marine life seen in surface and coastal waters and frequently visited abundance hotspots will likely give many in society a false impression of the abundance of marine animals. Unexploited baseline biomass predictions from the simple macroecological model were used to calibrate a more complex size- and trait-based model to estimate fisheries yield and impacts. Yields are highly dependent on baseline biomass and fisheries selectivity. Predicted global sustainable fisheries yield increases &#8776;4 fold when smaller individuals (< 20 cm from species of maximum mass < 1kg) are targeted in all oceans, but the predicted yields would rarely be accessible in practice and this fishing strategy leads to the collapse of larger species if fishing mortality rates on different size classes cannot be decoupled. Our analyses show that models with minimal parameter demands that are based on a few established ecological principles can support equitable analysis and comparison of diverse ecosystems. The analyses provide insights into the effects of parameter uncertainty on global biomass and production estimates, which have yet to be achieved with complex models, and will therefore help to highlight priorities for future research and data collection. However, the focus on simple model structures and global processes means that non-phytoplankton primary production and several groups, structures and processes of ecological and conservation interest are not represented. Consequently, our simple models become increasingly less useful than more complex alternatives when addressing questions about food web structure and function, biodiversity, resilience and human impacts at smaller scales and for areas closer to coasts.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

We present a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships for all of the currently recognized species of northern hemisphere Nucella, based on an analysis of 718 base pairs of nucleotide sequence from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The order of appearance of species in the fossil record is congruent with this hypothesis. The topology of the inferred phylogeny of Nucella, coupled with ecological, morphological, and fossil evidence, was used to address three main questions: (1) At what time and by which route was the North Atlantic invaded from the North Pacific compared to prior studies of the trans-Arctic interchange? (2) Do patterns of molecular variation within species corroborate the importance of climatic cycles in driving speciation in north temperate marine animals? (3) Was radiation in the direction of increased or decreased ecological specialization, body size, or Vulnerability to predation? Molecular evidence confirmed that the sole North Atlantic species, N. lapillus, arose from a North Pacific ancestor. Biogeographic and paleontological evidence supported the dispersal of Nucella, and perhaps other interchange species, via the Eurasian Arctic. Rather intriguingly, the linkage of N. lapillus to a western as opposed to eastern Pacific clade, and the biogeographic origins of the eastern Pacific species, parallel closely similar patterns observed in another genus of rocky-shore gastropods, Littorina. This congruence, in conjunction with information on the climatic and geographic histories of the region, as well as the geographic arrangement of mtDNA haplotypes within Nucella species, supports a model of speciation in Nucella driven by cycles of climatic amelioration and deterioration that began during the Miocene. Calibrations from the fossil record of Nucella suggest that third position transitions and transversions accrue at a rate of 3-4% and 0.5% respectively per million yr. This supports an early participation by Nucella in the trans-Arctic interchange, as suggested by paleobiogeographic studies. Consistent with the unstable taxonomic history of species of Nucella, we found few nonmolecular traits to be phylogenetically informative. Among North Pacific species, more recently derived species (N. canaliculata and the N. emarginata clade) were more ecologically specialized (narrower diet and habitat range). Consistent with extensive intraspecific variation, shell traits were quite labile evolutionarily: neither overall size nor development of antipredatory traits exhibited consistent evolutionary trends over the history of the genus. Nurse eggs (unfertilized eggs consumed by developing embryos) were an ancestral trait that was lost evolutionarily in the two clades that also exhibited increased body size, suggesting that these two life-history traits may be coupled. The reduced number of chromosomes in N. lapillus is clearly a derived state and is consistent with White's (1978) observations on chromosome evolution in other clades.",10.2307/2410698,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,Didn't use the traits in a way we can classify it,

Constructing these networks requires considerable empirical efforts, and this remains highly challenging due to sampling limitations and the laborious and notoriously limited, error-prone process of traditional taxonomic identification. Recent advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing and high-performance computing provide new ways to address these challenges. DNA metabarcoding, a method of bulk taxonomic identification from DNA extracted from environmental samples, can generate detailed biodiversity information through a standardizable analytical pipeline for species detection. When this biodiversity information is annotated with prior knowledge on taxon interactions, body size, and trophic position, it is possible to generate trait-based networks, which we call ""heuristic food webs"". Although curating trait matrices for constructing heuristic food webs is a laborious, often intractable process using manual literature surveys, it can be greatly accelerated via text mining, allowing knowledge of relevant traits to be gathered across large databases. To explore this possibility, we employed a General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) system to create a hybrid text-mining pipeline combining rule-based and machine-learning modules. This pipeline was then used to query online repositories of published papers for missing data on a key trait, body size, that could not be gathered from existing trophic link libraries of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates. Combining text-mined body size information with feeding information from existing sources allowed us to generate a database of over 20,000 pairwise trophic interactions. Next, we developed a pipeline that uses taxa lists generated from DNA metabarcoding and annotates this matrix with trophic information from existing databases and text-mined body size data. In this way, we generated heuristic food webs for wetland sites within a large delta complex formed by the confluence of the Peace and Athabasca rivers in northern Alberta: the Peace Athabasca delta. Finally, we used these putative food webs and their network properties to resolve spatial and temporal differences between the benthic subwebs of wetlands in the Peace and Athabasca sectors of the delta complex. Specifically, we asked two questions. (1) How do food web properties (e.g. number of links, linkage density, trophic height) differ between the wetlands of the Peace and Athabasca deltas? (2) How do food web properties change temporally in wetlands of the two deltas? We discuss using DNA-generated, trait-based food webs as a powerful tool for rapid bioassessment, assess the limitations of our current approach, and outline a path forward to make this powerful tool more widely available for land managers and conservation biologists.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Carbon storage in vegetation and soil underpins climate regulation through carbon sequestration. Because plant species differ in their ability to capture, store and release carbon, the collective functional characteristics of plant communities (functional diversity) should be a major driver of carbon accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems.2. Three major components of plant functional diversity could be put forward as drivers of carbon storage in ecosystems: the most abundant functional trait values, the variety of functional trait values and the abundance of particular species that could have additional effects not incorporated in the first two components.3. We tested for associations between these components and carbon storage across 16 sites in the Chaco forest of Argentina under the same climate and on highly similar parental material. The sites differed in their plant functional diversity caused by different long-term land-use regimes.4. We measured six plant functional traits in 27 species and weighted them by the species abundance at each site to calculate the community-weighted mean (CWM) and the functional divergence (FDvar) of each single trait and of multiple traits (FDiv). We also measured plant and soil carbon storage. Using a stepwise multiple regression analysis, we assessed which of the functional diversity components best explained carbon storage.5. Both CWM and FDvar of plant height and wood-specific gravity, but no leaf traits, were retained as predictors of carbon storage in multiple models. Relationships of FDvar of stem traits and FDiv with carbon storage were all negative. The abundance of five species improved the predictive power of some of the carbon storage models.6. Synthesis. All three major components of plant functional diversity contributed to explain carbon storage. What matters the most to carbon storage in these ecosystems is the relative abundance of plants with tall, and to a lesser extent dense, stems with a narrow range of variation around these values. No consistent link was found between carbon storage and the leaf traits usually associated with plant resource use strategy. The negative association of trait divergence with carbon storage provided no evidence in support to niche complementarity promoting carbon storage in these forest ecosystems.",10.1111/1365-2745.12012,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = high leaf concentration of nitrogen, low leaf dry matter content, tensile strength, specific leaf area, plant height, wood specific gravity",

Developing models to predict potential spread and effects is difficult because local adaptation may have occurred among populations, parameter values for biological characteristics vary widely for these opportunistic generalists, and methodological differences complicate comparison and synthesis of studies. I review bigheaded carp biological parameters across a wide range of literature, including studies of native and introduced populations. I then evaluate how predictive models are parameterized, noting inconsistencies and highlighting data gaps. My analysis finds that although parameter values tend to vary substantially among and within systems, models are generally parameterized using the best information available, although bioenergetics and trophic models particularly need improvement. Some predictive tools can be updated using existing data (e.g., velocity requirements for spawning), but in other cases further research is needed. Research priorities include (1) better understanding bigheaded carp phenotypic plasticity among and within systems, (2) determining key biological traits of bigheaded carp populations at risk of seeding further invasions (e.g., Illinois River populations that may spread to Lake Michigan), and (3) monitoring bigheaded carp ecological effects on native fishes and plankton communities.

Predation and parasitism are important factors in the ecology and evolution of natural populations and may, along with other environmental factors, interact with the impact of anthropogenic pollutants. 2. Our study aimed at identifying potential interactions between three stressors (predation threat, parasitism and pesticide exposure) and at exploring the predictability of their joint effects by using the model of independent action. We assessed in a full-factorial design the impacts of these stressors on key life-history traits and population growth rate of the water flea Daphnia magna. 3. When applied as single stressors, predation threat and parasite challenge induced varying stressor-specific adaptive responses. The pesticide carbaryl was applied at a generally sublethal concentration, which caused low mortality only in first-brood offspring. 4. Pesticide exposure interacted synergistically with parasite challenge regarding survival, which suggests immunomodulatory activity of the pesticide. Predation threat by phantom midge larvae showed antagonistic interactions for amount of first-brood offspring with both parasite challenge and carbaryl exposure. All stressors additively affected age and size at maturity, which added up to a considerable delay in the onset of reproduction in the three-stressor combination. The intrinsic rate of natural increase, r, reflected the non-additive and additive effects on single endpoints and showed significant synergistic interactions for all two-stressor combinations. The combination of all stressors resulted in a dramatic reduction of r compared to the stressor-free control. 5. The model of independent action proved useful in quantitatively predicting effects of additively acting stressors, and in visualizing the occurrence and magnitude of non-additive effects in accordance with results of analysis of variances. 6. Synthesis and applications. Cumulative additive effects and non-additive interactions of natural antagonists and pollutants are shown to result in considerable impacts on ecologically relevant parameters. As a starting point for an environmentally more realistic risk assessment of chemicals, it may be a valuable strategy to screen for non-additive effects among many stress factors simultaneously in simplified experimental designs by using the model of independent action.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01566.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,No environmental filtering,

"Corbin, Jeffrey D.; D'Antonio, Carla M.",2011,Abundance and productivity mediate invader effects on nitrogen dynamics in a California grassland,ECOSPHERE,"Soil nitrogen (N) transformations have been shown to be influenced by plant community composition. Identifying species traits that control nitrogen dynamics is more straightforward when species dramatically differ in N input via litter (e.g., N-fixing invaders in a non-fixing community) or in litter carbon: N or lignin: N ratios. Cases where invaders and residents are more similar for such traits are more challenging to evaluate. In these settings, a species' relative abundance and its contribution to overall ecosystem productivity are likely to contribute significantly to the development of effects on N availability and cycling.We compared soil N dynamics in experimental grassland communities dominated by native perennial grasses (NP), exotic annual grasses (EA), and exotic perennial grasses (EP), as well as mixtures of the native perennial grasses with each exotic grass group (NP + EA and NP + EP). These groups differ from each other in subtle ways in traits likely to influence soil N cycling including annual productivity, allocation to roots versus shoots, litter production, litter chemistry, and degree of summertime activity. We found that ecosystem N dynamics were significantly different between the various species groups with the greatest differences occurring between EA plots and other community types: soils in EA plots had significantly lower rates of net N mineralization, net nitrification, and microbial biomass-N compared to either NP or NP + EA plots, and lower extractable nitrate in the spring compared to either NP or EP plots. The higher the proportion of productivity in a plot that derived from exotic species, particularly exotic annual species, the lower were the measured rates of net N mineralization. Stepwise regression analysis showed that vegetation productivity was the best predictor of N cycling metrics: the higher the productivity, the higher the rates of net mineralization and nitrification, and microbial biomass-N.We conclude that species' abundance and productivity were strong controlling factors in the development of differences in ecosystem N dynamics between our experimental treatments. Inclusion of relative proportion of productivity contributed by community members in models of the development of species effects will likely aid in predicting when and where invasive species will alter ecosystem N dynamics.",10.1890/ES10-00113.1,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = annual productivity, allocation to roots vs shoots, litter production, litter chemistry, and degree of summertime activity",
"Cornelissen, JHC; Song, YB; Yu, FH; Dong, M",2014,Plant traits and ecosystem effects of clonality: a new research agenda,ANNALS OF BOTANY,"Background Clonal plants spread laterally by spacers between their ramets (shoot-root units); these spacers can transport and store resources. While much is known about how clonality promotes plant fitness, we know little about how different clonal plants influence ecosystem functions related to carbon, nutrient and water cycling. Approach The response-effect trait framework is used to formulate hypotheses about the impact of clonality on ecosystems. Central to this framework is the degree of correspondence between interspecific variation in clonal 'response traits' that promote plant fitness and interspecific variation in 'effect traits', which define a plant's potential effect on ecosystem functions. The main example presented to illustrate this concept concerns clonal traits of vascular plant species that determine their lateral extension patterns. In combination with the different degrees of decomposability of litter derived from their spacers, leaves, roots and stems, these clonal traits should determine associated spatial and temporal patterns in soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient availability and water retention. Conclusions This review gives some concrete pointers as to how to implement this new research agenda through a combination of (1) standardized screening of predominant species in ecosystems for clonal response traits and for effect traits related to carbon, nutrient and water cycling; (2) analysing the overlap between variation in these response traits and effect traits across species; (3) linking spatial and temporal patterns of clonal species in the field to those for soil properties related to carbon, nutrient and water stocks and dynamics; and (4) studying the effects of biotic interactions and feedbacks between resource heterogeneity and clonality.

"Cornwell, WK; Ackerly, DD",2010,A link between plant traits and abundance: evidence from coastal California woody plants,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"P>1. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that plant traits play a crucial role in determining the success or failure of species in a given environment. However, whether traits play a role in determining species' abundance and rarity among the co-occurring species within a community remains an unresolved question. 2. To address this, we analysed the abundance of California coastal woody plant species at landscape and local scales in relation to 11 leaf, wood and seed traits. 3. At the landscape scale, we found no significant relationship between traits and abundance. In contrast, at the local scale we found significant relationships between abundance and four traits: specific leaf area (SLA), height, lumen fraction and wood density. For SLA and height, the relationship was linear; for lumen fraction, it was quadratic. For wood density, the direction of the trait-abundance relationship was dependant on the abiotic context, that is, it shifted across a gradient in soil water content. 4.Synthesis. Understanding the connections between traits and abundance is important for two reasons. First, there is an ongoing debate about the degree to which commonness and rarity are the result of drift among ecologically equivalent species or niche processes. These results suggest that there are non-random, trait-based processes affecting abundance and rarity. Secondly, species' traits have been shown to have a strong effect on photosynthesis and decomposition rates, mediated by the abundance of the species.

The model included previously modeled areas in the NW Mediterranean (the Gulf of Lions and the Southern Catalan Sea) and expanded their ranges, covering 45,547 km(2), with depths from 0 to 1000 in. The study area was chosen to specifically account for the connectivity between the areas and shared fish stocks and fleets. Input data were based on local scientific surveys and fishing statistics, published data on stomach content analyses, and the application of empirical equations to estimate consumption and production rates. The model was composed of 54 functional groups, from primary producers to top predators, and Spanish and French fishing fleets were considered. Results were analyzed using ecological indicators and compared with outputs from ecosystem models developed in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Cadiz prior to this study. Results showed that the main trophic flows were associated with detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Several high trophic level organisms (such as dolphins, benthopelagic cephalopods, large demersal fishes from the continental shelf, and other large pelagic fishes), and the herbivorous salema fish, were identified as keystone groups within the ecosystem. Results confirmed that fishing impact was high and widespread throughout the food web. The comparative approach highlighted that, despite productivity differences, the ecosystems shared common features in structure and functioning traits such as the important role of detritus, the dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and the importance of benthic pelagic coupling.

However, it is unclear how the magnitude of additive genetic variation in the evolving species mediates those effects. In this study, I explore how the magnitude of prey additive genetic variation determines what effects prey evolution has on the dynamics and stability of predator-prey systems. I use linear stability analysis to decompose the stability of a general eco-evolutionary predator-prey model into components representing the stabilities of the ecological and evolutionary subsystems as well as the interactions between those subsystems. My results show that with low genetic variation, the cyclic dynamics and stability of the system are determined by the ecological subsystem. With increased genetic variation, disruptive selection always destabilizes stable communities, stabilizing selection can stabilize or destabilize communities, and prey evolution can alter predator-prey phase lags. Stability changes occur approximately when the magnitude of genetic variation balances the (in) stabilities of the ecological and evolutionary subsystems. I discuss the connections between my stability results and prior results from the theory of adaptive dynamics.",10.1086/687393,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Cortez, MH",2018,Genetic variation determines which feedbacks drive and alter predator-prey eco-evolutionary cycles,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"Evolution can alter the ecological dynamics of communities, but the effects depend on the magnitudes of standing genetic variation in the evolving species. Using an eco-coevolutionary predator-prey model, I identify how the magnitudes of prey and predator standing genetic variation determine when ecological, evolutionary, and eco-evolutionary feedbacks influence system stability and the phase lags in predator-prey cycles. Here, feedbacks are defined by subsystems, i.e., the dynamics of a subset of the components of the whole system when the other components are held fixed; ecological (evolutionary) feedbacks involve the direct and indirect effects between population densities (species traits) and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involve the direct and indirect effects between population densities and traits. When genetic variation is low in both species, ecological feedbacks and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving either the predator or the prey trait have the strongest effects on system stability, when genetic variation is high in one species, evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving that species' trait have the strongest effects, and, when genetic variation is high in both species, evolutionary feedbacks involving one or both traits and eco-coevolutionary feedbacks involving both traits have the strongest effects. I present the biological conditions under which each feedback can destabilize the whole system and cause predator-prey cycles. Predator-prey cycles can also arise when all feedbacks are stabilizing. This counterintuitive outcome occurs when feedbacks involving many variables are more stabilizing than feedbacks involving fewer variables or vice versa. I also identify how the indirect effects of prey and predator density on the predator dynamics (mediated by evolutionary responses in one or both species) alter the phase lags in predator-prey cycles. I present conditions under which the trait-mediated indirect effects introduce delays that cause the lag between prey and predator peaks to increase. This work explains and unifies empirical and theoretical studies on how predator-prey coevolution alters the dynamics of predator-prey systems and how those effects depend on the magnitudes of prey and predator standing genetic variation.",10.1002/ecm.1304/full,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,Never actually tested any real species traits#,
"Cortois, R.",2015,Predictability of plant-soil feedback.,Predictability of plant-soil feedback,"This thesis explores the role of soil biota as possible drivers of linkages between plant community diversity and plant productivity. The study was carried out in the framework of a large grassland biodiversity experiment in Jena, Thuringia, Germany, the so-called Jena Experiment. Chapter 1 explains how soil biota may exert control over plant community productivity by recycling organic material and by intimately interacting with plant roots, either acting as antagonists to plants or as plant growth-promoting symbionts. In the second chapter, studies that use an experimental approach of inoculating live soils into sterilized background soils to study the effects of root symbionts on plant growth, are reviewed. Chapter 3 tests how plant traits relate to PSF using a 49 grassland plant species of the Jena Experiment. In chapter 4, the relation between phylogenetic relatedness and the feedback effect of one (soil conditioning) plant species to another (responding) plant species, is examined. Further, chapter 5 uses the PSFmixed values of chapter 3 in a correlational analysis to test how short-term PSFs relate to longer-term species' performances in the field, using established monocultures and species-rich (60 species) plant communities of the Jena Experiment. Finally, chapter 6 examines the role of quality and quantity of plant biomass in driving nematode feeding group abundance and diversity. A strong positive effects of both plant species- and plant functional group-richness on abundances of plant feeding, bacterial feeding and fungal feeding nematodes, as well as omnivores, but not for predators, was established. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis showed that the positive effect of plant diversity on the abundance of microbial feeding nematodes (fungal plus bacterial feeders) could not be explained by increased microbial biomass. Similarly, the abundance of plant feeding nematodes was not driven by the higher plant biomass in species rich plant communities. Instead, increased plant biomass explained the positive relation between plant species richness and the abundance of microbial feeding nematodes, while for plant feeding nematodes, increased C to N ratio of aboveground plant biomass appeared to explain the positive relation between the abundance of plant feeding nematodes and plant species and functional group richness. Importantly, the density of plant feeding nematodes per unit root biomass decreased with increasing plant diversity, indicating a root feeder dilution effect. It is concluded that plant diversity does not explain nematode community composition primarily by simple bottom-up relations, but that other aspects, such as quality of resource and microhabitats quality, may play a role as well.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,Does look at what we're after but can't get access to the book,
"Costanzo, KS; Taylor, DJ",2010,Rapid ecological isolation and intermediate genetic divergence in lacustrine cyclic parthenogens,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: Ecological shifts can promote rapid divergence and speciation. However, the role of ecological speciation in animals that reproduce predominantly asexually with periodic sex and strong dispersal, such as lacustrine cladocerans, is poorly understood. These life history traits may slow or prevent ecological lineage formation among populations. Proponents of the postglacial ecological isolation hypothesis for Daphnia suggest that some species have formed postglacially in adjacent, but ecologically different habitats. We tested this hypothesis with ecological, morphological, and multilocus coalescence analyses in the putative lacustrine sister species, Daphnia parvula and Daphnia retrocurva. Results: Daphnia parvula and D. retrocurva showed strong habitat separation with rare co-occurrence. Lakes inhabited by D. parvula were smaller in size and contained lower densities of invertebrate predators compared to lakes containing D. retrocurva. In the laboratory, D. retrocurva was less vulnerable to invertebrate predation, whereas D. parvula was less vulnerable to vertebrate predation and was smaller and more transparent than D. retrocurva. The species are significantly differentiated at mitochondrial and nuclear loci and form an intermediate genetic divergence pattern between panmixia and reciprocal monophyly. Coalescence and population genetic modelling indicate a Late or Post Glacial time of divergence with a demographic expansion. Conclusions: Despite their young age and mixed breeding system, D. parvula and D. retrocurva exhibit significant ecological and genetic divergence that is coincident with the formation of deep temperate glacial lakes. We propose that predation may have facilitated the rapid divergence between D. parvula and D. retrocurva and that intermediate divergence of aquatic cyclic parthenogens is likely more common than previously thought.",10.1186/1471-2148-10-166,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Other,Lake,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = daphnia.

However, numerous studies have found considerable heritable variation in traits related to immune function, which should be closely linked to fitness. This could be due to trade-offs maintaining variation in these traits. We used the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, as a model system to examine the quantitative genetics of insect immune function. We estimated the heritabilities of several different measures of innate immunity and the genetic correlations between these immune traits and a number of life history traits. Our results provide the first evidence for a potential genetic trade-off within the insect immune system, with antibacterial activity (lysozyme-like) exhibiting a significant negative genetic correlation with haemocyte density, which itself is positively genetically correlated with both haemolymph phenoloxidase activity and cuticular melanization.

"Cottingham, KL; Schindler, DE",2000,Effects of grazer community structure on phytoplankton response to nutrient pulses,ECOLOGY,"Sensitivity, the magnitude of change following perturbation, and return rate, the rate of recovery, are two key components of ecological stability. We quantified these properties for phytoplankton in lakes using pulsed nutrient loading as the perturbation. Theory predicts that grazer community structure should influence how phytoplankton respond to pulsed nutrient loading. In particular, phytoplankton in lakes with large, effective grazers such as Daphnia are expected to be less sensitive to, but recover more slowly from, nutrient perturbations than phytoplankton in lakes with smaller grazers. We tested these predictions by adding standardized small and large pulses of nutrients (similar to 10 and similar to 100 mu g P/L of epilimnion; with N at an N: P ratio of similar to 25:1 by mass) to two natural ponds with contrasting grazer communities that resulted from the deliberate addition of planktivorous fishes to one pond. Site-specific responses were examined by conducting the experiment in the same ponds over two consecutive summers (1994 and 1995), but switching the fish treatments between years.In both years, phytoplankton in the pond with large-bodied zooplankton grazers were less sensitive to small pulses of nutrients than were phytoplankton in the pond with small grazers, confirming the expectation that large zooplankton can buffer lakes against nutrient perturbations. However, responses to the large nutrient pulse were less consistent: phytoplankton in the pond with large zooplankton were less sensitive to the large perturbation only in 1995. This unexpected result appears to be due mainly to a 2.6 times greater total zooplankton biomass in the pond with small grazers on the day of the large pulse in 1994. Thus, although the presence of large-bodied zooplankton appears to reduce phytoplankton sensitivity to small nutrient pulses, other factors, including zooplankton biomass, need to be incorporated into predictions for phytoplankton responses to large perturbations.Consistent with expectations, larger zooplankton appeared to slow recovery from nutrient perturbations, since the pond with fish and small grazers had faster return rates following the large nutrient pulse in both years of the experiment. Differences in life history traits between small and large species of zooplankton appear to account for these differences in recovery rates. Our results thus provide some support for theoretical expectations that management activities which alter grazer community structure may also affect the stability of phytoplankton communities to nutrient perturbations; additional experiments are needed to confirm the generality of this result.",10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0183:EOGCSO]2.0.CO;2,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Freshwater,Plankton,Lake,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,Traits Used = body size,

We analysed a two-species competition-colonisation model of vegetation with intra-specific variability in juvenile growth. On each patch colonised by both species, the winner was the juvenile with higher individual growth. Intra-specific variability disproportionately favoured the more fecund species because the tail of its distribution represented more individuals. In some cases, this process could even lead to a reversal of competition hierarchy and exclusion of the species with higher mean juvenile performance. In the space of species 2 mean growth and fecundity traits, the combinations of traits allowing coexistence with species 1 appeared close to an ideal trade-off curve. Along this curve, species 2 and species 1 coexisted at similar abundance. The balance of relative abundances diminished with the distance of species 2 from this curve. For a given level of relative species performances, coexistence stability increased continuously as species differentiation increased. In contrast to classical models that exhibit abrupt changes of equilibrium community properties when species traits vary, our model displayed continuous changes of these properties in relation to the balance of life traits within and among species.

"Courchamp, F; Langlais, M; Sugihara, G",2000,Rabbits killing birds: modelling the hyperpredation process,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. Introduced rabbits are known to have catastrophic effects on oceanic islands, either by direct destruction of the vegetative cover, or by the resulting disturbance of indigenous vertebrates.2. Another dramatic effect, less well known, but potentially of major importance, is the hyperpredation process. This process, related to apparent competition, predicts that an introduced prey species, well adapted to high predation pressure, could induce the extinction of an indigenous prey, through the sudden increased population size of an introduced predator. In many island ecosystems, the simultaneous presence of introduced feral cats and rabbits is thus potentially a further threat for small vertebrates endemic of these islands.3. Through a mathematical model, we tested this hypothesis, using a tri-trophic system comprising an indigenous prey (birds), an introduced prey (rabbits) and an introduced predator (cats), and we demonstrated the theoretical existence of the hyperpredation process.4. In addition, the numerical analysis of the model allowed a quantification of this process. It shows that the conditions required for an indigenous species to cope with the hyperpredation process imply very high intrinsic growth rates and/or carrying capacity, as well as behavioural anti-predator response to the introduced predator. Since these conditions are unlikely to be met, this process is a further potential threat to most indigenous vertebrate prey.5. Finally, our model shows that, although it can be induced by both types of adaptation together or alone, behavioural adaptations alone are more powerful in generating the hyperpredation process, than are life history traits adaptations.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2000.00383.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Here, we applied a trait-based framework to address whether and how environmental filtering and niche differentiation influence the diversity of ECM fungal enzymatic activities in two oak-dominated forest ecosystems. We hypothesized that fungal enzymatic activities and ECM community assembly are influenced by the availability of targeted resources in the surrounding soil. We pinpointed a major influence of environmental filtering on ECM fungal taxonomic and functional composition. Contrasted taxonomic composition among forest ecosystems was linked to broad interspecific trait variation and entailed contrasted functional responses at community level. However, intraspecific trait variation contributed to community response within ecosystems. We characterized a strong relationship between enzymatic activities and targeted resource availability in surrounding soil, suggesting a functional role of the enzymes for the acquisition of these resources.

Mc1r is an important gene in the melanin synthesis pathway and is associated with ecologically important variation in color pattern in birds, mammals, and other squamate reptiles.

Tests of the SDH at limited spatial scales have thus far demonstrated equivocal support and no prior study has assessed the generality of the SDH at continental scales. We examined over 53 000 tree communities spanning the eastern United States to determine whether functional trait variation and phylogenetic diversity support the SDH for gradients of water and soil nutrient availability. This analysis incorporated two complementary datasets, those of the U. S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis National program and the Carolina Vegetation Survey, and was based on three ecologically important traits: leaf nitrogen, seed mass, and wood density. We found that mean trait values were weakly correlated with water and soil nutrient availability, but that trait diversity did not vary consistently along either gradient. This did not conform to trait variation expected under the SDH and instead suggested that environmental filters structure tree communities throughout both gradients, without evidence for an increased role of competition in less stressful environments. Phylogenetic diversity of communities was principally driven by the ratio of angiosperms to gymnosperms and therefore did not exhibit the pattern of variation along stress gradients expected under the SDH.

The approach can be applied to phylogenetic analysis of taxonomically selected taxa, as an economical alternative to mitogenome sequencing from individual species, or to environmental samples of mixed specimens, such as from mass trapping of invertebrates. The routine generation of mitochondrial genome sequences has great potential both for systematics and community phylogenetics. Mapping of reads from low-coverage shotgun sequencing of environmental samples also makes it possible to obtain data on spatial and temporal turnover in whole-community phylogenetic and species composition, even in complex ecosystems where species-level taxonomy and biodiversity patterns are poorly known. In addition, read mapping can produce information on species biomass, and potentially allows quantification of within-species genetic variation. The success of MMG relies on the formation of numerous mitochondrial genome contigs, achievable with standard genome assemblers, but various challenges for the efficiency of assembly remain, particularly in the face of variable relative species abundance and intra-specific genetic variation. Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated the power of mitogenomes from MMG for accurate phylogenetic placement, evolutionary analysis of species traits, biodiversity discovery and the establishment of species distribution patterns; it offers a promising avenue for unifying the ecological and evolutionary understanding of species diversity.",10.1186/s13742-016-0120-y,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this genus consists of three main lineages. Two of the lineages include highly generalized basal species and relatively specialized distal species, and one of the lineages comprises four specialized species. We tested for phylogenetic conservatism in the traits studied via randomizing host-plant use, and the four basic Timema colour patterns, across the tips of the phylogeny, and determining if the observed number of inferred changes was significantly low compared to the distribution of numbers of inferred changes expected under the null model. This analysis showed that (1) host-plant use has evolved nonrandomly, such that more closely related species tend to use similar sets of hosts and (2) colour pattern evolution exhibits considerable lability. Inference of ancestral states using maximum parsimony, under four models for the relative ease of gain and loss of plant hosts or colour morphs, showed that (1) for all models with gains of host-plants even marginally more difficult than losses, and for most optimizations with gains and losses equally difficult, the ancestral Timema were generalized, feeding on the chaparral plants Ceanothus and Adenostoma and possibly other taxa, and (2) for all models with gains of colour morphs more difficult than losses, the ancestral Timema were polymorphic for colour pattern. Generation of null distributions of inferred ancestral states showed that the maximum-parsimony inference of host-plant generalization was most robust for the most speciose of the three main Timema lineages. Ancestral states were also inferred using maximum likelihood, after recoding host-plant use and colour polymorphism as dichotomous characters. Likelihood analyses provided some support for inference of generalization in host-plant use at ancestral nodes of the two lineages exhibiting mixtures of generalists and specialists, although levels of uncertainty were high. By contrast, likelihood analysis did not estimate ancestral colour morph patterns with any confidence, due to inferred rates of change that were high with respect to speciation rates. Information from biogeography, floristic history and the timing of diversification of the genus are compatible with patterns of inferred ancestral host-plant use. Diversification in the genus Timema appears to engender three main processes: (1) increased specialization via loss of host-plants, (2) retention of the same, single, host-plant and (3) shifts to novel hosts to which lineages were 'preadapted' in colour pattern. Our evidence suggests that the radiation of this genus has involved multiple evolutionary transitions from individual-level specialization (multiple-niche polymorphism) to population-level and species-level specialization. Ecological studies of Timema suggest that such transitions are driven by diversifying selection for crypsis.

The strawberry poison frog Dendrobates pumilio is an exceptionally polytypic (populations are phenotypically distinct) aposematic frog exhibiting variation in warning color and brightness. In the Solarte population, males and females both respond differentially to male brightness variation. Here, we demonstrate through spectrophotometry and visual modeling that aposematic brightness variation within this population is likely visible to two putative predators (crabs, snakes) and conspecifics but not to the presumed major predator (birds). This study thus suggests that signal brightness within D. pumilio populations can be shaped by sexual selection, with limited opportunity for natural selection to influence this trait due to predator sensory constraints.

Between-species variation in mating behaviour was a more significant factor affecting species exclusion than variation in development time. Specifically, the ability of B to copulate more effectively than other species resulted in a faster rate of population increase for B, as well as a reduced rate of population growth for other species, leading to species exclusion. The greater ability of B to evolve resistance to insecticides also contributed to exclusion of other species in some cases. 5.

However, evaluating the appropriateness of hybrids for use in restoration programs is difficult. Past the F1 generation, the proportion of a progenitor's genome can vary widely, as can the combinations of parental genomes. Detailed genetic analysis can reveal this information, but cannot expose phenotypic alterations due to heterosis, transgressive traits, or changes in metabolism or development. In addition, because evolution is often driven by extreme individuals, decisions based on phenotypic averages of hybrid classes may have unintended results. We demonstrate a strategy to evaluate hybrids for use in restoration by visualizing hybrid phenotypes across selected groups of traits relative to both progenitor species. Specifically, we used discriminant analysis to differentiate among butternut (Juglans cinerea L.), black walnut (J. nigra L.), and Japanese walnut (J. ailantifolia Carr. var. cordiformis) using vegetative characters and then with functional adaptive traits associated with seedling performance. When projected onto the progenitor trait space, naturally occurring hybrids (J. x bixbyi Rehd.) between butternut and Japanese walnut showed introgression toward Japanese walnut at vegetative characters but exhibited a hybrid swarm at functional traits. Both results indicate that hybrids have morphological and ecological phenotypes that distinguish them from butternut, demonstrating a lack of ecological equivalency that should not be carried into restoration breeding efforts. Despite these discrepancies, some hybrids were projected into the space occupied by butternut seedlings' 95% confidence ellipse, signifying that some hybrids were similar at the measured traits. Determining how to consistently identify these individuals is imperative for future breeding and species restoration efforts involving hybrids. Discriminant analysis provides a useful technique to visualize past selection mechanisms and current variation in hybrid populations, especially when key ecological traits that distinguish progenitors are unknown. Furthermore, discriminant analysis affords a tool to assess ecological equivalency of hybrid populations and breeding program efforts to select for certain traits and monitor the amount of variability of those traits, relative to progenitors.",10.3389/fpls.2016.01741,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Specifically, these new metrics are mathematically independent of the number of organisms analysed and account for the abundance of organisms. They can also be calculated with more than two stable isotopes. In addition, we also provide a procedure for calculating the levels of isotopic overlap (similarity and turnover) between two groups of organisms. These metrics have been implemented into new functions in R made freely available to users and we illustrated their application using stable isotope values from a freshwater fish community.

This assumption has been challenged by the neutral theory that assumes that the maintenance of biodiversity mainly depends on the ecological drift and dispersal limitation. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity depends on decomposing the variation of species diversity into the contributions from the various components that affect it. We investigated and partitioned the effects of the biotic component (productivity, forest spatial structure) and the environmental component (topography and soil fertility) on the distribution of tree species richness jointly (the combined effect of environment and biotic process) and separately (the effect of environment or biotic process alone) in 25 permanent plots of 600 m(2) in a subtropical evergreen broadleaf secondary forest in southern China.

Our results indicated that (1) tree species richness had significant negative relationship with productivity and a unimodal relationship with its spatially structured distribution; (2) biotic and environmental factors both have significant influence on species richness and jointly explain similar to 60% of the variation for the overall tree assemblage, and the variation explained by the two components jointly increased across growth stages (34%, 44%, and 75%, respectively); (3) additive variation partitioning revealed that the tree species richness was dominantly controlled by environmental factors (32%), while the biotic component also independently contributed a non-negligible effect (16%); and (4) the dominant fraction changed from the biotic component to the environmental component across growth stages.

We quantified the size-specific probability of different modes of death and the resultant potential for successful spawning, and then modelled the theoretical relationship between female length and fitness (spawning success) in the population.This optimal distribution closely matched the observed length distribution of the focal population, when removals by the size-selective commercial fishery were included. We then used a likelihood-based approach to compare competing model predictions to length distributions from other populations in the watershed with different levels of size-selective freshwater mortality, as determined by the physical characteristics of the spawning grounds.This study provides a quantitative framework for assessing female spawning success in wild populations, as represented by the expected number of eggs deposited per spawning female. These results advance previous analyses of natural selection in that predictions for phenotypic distributions were generated and then compared to those observed in situ, rather than assuming the adaptive nature of observed distributions.Lay Summary",10.1111/1365-2435.12112,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Fish,Estuary,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,Traits Used =  body size.

Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. The model captured >70% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems.

To identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled, dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on species' connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further, to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models. This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover, there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low trophic levels.

Location: A mainland-island landscape in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. Methods: Dung beetles were sampled along 100 sampling units within four large forest fragments. We partitioned beta diversity into SCBD and LCBD aiming to explore their relationships to species and site characteristics, respectively. We then used a combination of multivariate methods and beta regression analyses to examine patterns in SCBD and LCBD. The occupancy, total abundance, niche position, niche breadth and biological traits of species were used as predictor variables for SCBD values. Community metrics, environmental and spatial variables, and temporal patterns in the beta diversity components of turnover and nestedness were used as predictor variables for LCDB values. Results: We found that SCBD was strongly related to various species characteristics, such as occupancy, abundance and niche position, but was not related to biological traits of species and niche breadth. In particular, occupancy and its quadratic term showed a very strong unimodal relationship with SCBD, suggesting that intermediate species in terms of site occupancy contribute most to beta diversity. LCBD was mostly explained by variation in species richness, with a negative relationship being detected. Litter height and large-scale spatial variables were also important in explaining variation in LCBD. Main conclusions: SCBD and LCBD were highly predictably related to species occupancy and species richness, respectively. Environmental conditions and large-scale spatial variables also correlated with LCBD values.

Adaptive behavioral responses are thought to play a major role in animals' success or failure in such new environments. Approaches based on functional traits have proven especially valuable to understand how species communities respond to environmental gradients. Until recently, they have, however, often ignored the potential consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV). When ITV is prevalent, it may highly impact ecological processes and resilience against stressors. This may be especially relevant in animals, in which behavioral traits can be altered very flexibly at the individual level to track environmental changes. We investigated how species turnover and ITV influenced community-level behavioral responses in a set of 62 sites of varying levels of urbanization, using orb web spiders and their webs as models of foraging behavior. ITV alone explained around one-third of the total trait variation observed among communities. Spider web structure changed according to urbanization, in ways that increase the capture efficiency of webs in a context of smaller urban prey. These trait shifts were partly mediated by species turnover, but ITV increased their magnitude, potentially helping to buffer the effects of environmental changes on communities. The importance of ITV varied depending on traits and on the spatial scale at which urbanization was considered.

Species-specific models are not generalizable, whereas broad plant functional type models lack important detail. Here we consider plant trait patterns at the local scale and ask whether plant chemical traits are more closely linked to environmental gradients or to changes in species composition. We used the visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectrometer of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory to develop maps of four plant chemical traits-leaf nitrogen per mass, leaf carbon per mass, leaf water concentration, and canopy water content-across a diverse Mediterranean-type ecosystem (Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, CA). For all four traits, plant community alone was the strongest predictor of trait variation (explaining 46-61% of the heterogeneity), whereas environmental gradients accounted for just one fourth of the variation in the traits. This result emphasizes the critical role that species composition plays in mediating nutrient and carbon cycling within and among different communities.

However, it is unclear whether different biodiversity components, that is, taxonomy, function and phylogenetic, respond similarly to these filters. The integration of these different components into coherent and comprehensive analytical frameworks also remains unclear. In this study, we developed an approach to test the relative effects of elevation, habitat fragmentation and grazing management on the functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic structures of mountain pastures. Thirty summer farms, distributed along an elevational gradient were surveyed in the Italian Alps. Within these farms (around 100 ha), we identified all areas as one of two types of management (intensive or extensive), and we sampled three plots for each area, a total of 180 plots. Using the same mathematical framework, we quantified the functional (FD), phylogenetic (PD) and taxonomic (TD) diversity of each plot. We tested the influences of three environmental filters (elevation, habitat fragmentation and grazing management), using a series of partial regression analyses within a univariate and multivariate framework, as well as specific permutation schemes that accounted for our nested design. We found that elevation, habitat fragmentation, and grazing management affected the community structure, but in different ways. This finding confirmed that these filters operate at different scales and, despite some similarities, have different effects on various biodiversity components. Interestingly, FD was the only component that responded to all three types of predictors. Regarding functional aspects, elevation, as a broad-scale environmental gradient, showed a greater influence on dominant trait values, whereas at finer scales, grazing management had a primary effect on both dominant trait values and diversity measures. Habitat fragmentation showed a primary influence on TD, probably because the effect on dispersal limitations concerned mostly species availability. The hierarchical, multi-faceted approach adopted in this study yielded insights into the factors influencing biodiversity and community assembly processes in mountain pastures, thereby highlighting the importance of considering multiple facets of diversity in assessing the role of environmental filtering in vegetation structure.

This was done using a combination of metacommunity analysis and variance partitioning based on canonical correspondence analysis. Coccidian and ectoparasite metacommunities did not exhibit coherent structure. In contrast, helminths and the full parasite metacommunity had Clementsian and quasi-Clementsian structure, respectively, indicating that parasite species distributions for these metacommunities were compartmentalized along a dominant gradient. Variance decomposition indicated that characteristics associated with the host environment consistently explained more variation than did host traits associated with transmission opportunities or host phylogeny, indicating that the host environment is primary in shaping parasite species distributions among host species. Moreover, the importance of different types of host traits in structuring parasite metacommunities was consistent among taxonomic groups (i.e. full metacommunity, coccidians, and helminths) despite manifest differences in emergent structures (i.e. Clementsian, quasi-Clementsian, and random) that arose in response to variation in host environment.",10.1111/oik.00707,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Mammals,Desert,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,1,1,1,"Traits Used = adult mass, reproductive potential, longevity, trophic status, diet breadth, home range size.

Elizabeth",2011,"Seed survival in soil: interacting effects of predation, dormancy and the soil microbial community",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"P>1. Plant defence theory provides a robust framework for understanding interactions between plants and antagonists, and for interpreting broad patterns in the functional-trait composition of plant communities. However, this framework has been built almost entirely on traits expressed by seedlings and mature plants.2. No equivalent seed defence theory exists that recognizes the distinct suite of natural enemies that seeds encounter, and the unique constraints to their response. Furthermore, most attention has been paid to insect and vertebrate seed predators active above ground, whereas microbes in soil also have large effects on seed survival, particularly for plants that recruit from soil seed banks.3. We suggest that concurrent selection on seed dormancy and resistance to microbial antagonists should result in distinct seed defence syndromes. We predict that species with physical seed dormancy will rely on physical defences to exclude predators and pathogens, and rapid seed germination to escape pathogens at the emergence stage. In contrast, species with physiological seed dormancy will deploy a continuum of physical and chemical defences, depending on soil pathogen pressure and duration of seed persistence. Finally, seeds of some species persist in the soil in a non-dormant, imbibed state, and lack obvious chemical and physical defences. These seeds may be especially dependent upon protection from beneficial seed-inhabiting microbes.4. Framing a general 'seed defence theory' may help to account for the distribution of seed dormancy types across ecosystems. We predict that physiological dormancy will be favoured in dry or well-drained environments where pathogen pressure is relatively low, germination cues are most unpredictable, and seedling recruitment success is most variable. In contrast, physical dormancy should be favoured in warm and moist environments where pathogen pressure is high, and where germination cues are a stronger predictor of recruitment success. Persistent, non-dormant seeds are restricted to relatively aseasonal environments where favourable conditions for recruitment can occur over most of the year.5. Synthesis. Integrating seed defence and dormancy traits can provide new insights into selection on dormancy types, and will help elucidate major trends in seed ecology and evolution. Understanding how seeds are defended also may improve our ability to predict plant regeneration and help develop innovative management strategies for weedy and invasive species.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01739.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,"Said N because they don't actually test the traits they mention, they just postulate it might be a thing.

Investigations were carried out in two heavily industrialized and urbanized river basins from the NE of Spain (Llobregat and Besos). Measures of energy consumption (i.e. algal grazing), and of specific biochemical responses (biomarkers) were conducted on individuals transplanted upstream and downstream from effluent discharges of sewage treatment plants. In both rivers there was a clear deterioration of the ecological water quality parameters and benthic communities towards downstream reaches. In all but one of the 19 locations studied, transplanted organisms were affected in at least one of the five measured responses. In three of them, significant effects were detected in most of the traits considered. Principal Component and Partial Least Square Projections to Latent Structures regression analyses indicated that the measured responses in D. magna in situ bioassays and those of macroinvertebrate assemblages were affected by distinct environmental factors. From up to 20 environmental variables considered, seven of them including habitat degradation, suspended solids, nitrogenous and conductivity related parameters affected macroinvertebrate assemblages. On the other hand, levels of organophosphorus compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were high enough to trigger the responses of D. magna in situ bioassays.

A growing body of literature, however describes interactions whose strength is modified by the density of either a third species or by one of the species involved in a pairwise interaction. These modified interactions have been treated as indirect effects, and the terminology addressing them is diverse and overlapping. In this paper we develop a general analytical framework based on a qualitative analysis of community structure to account for the consequence of modified interactions in complex ecological communities. Modified interactions are found to create both direct and indirect effects between species. The sign of a direct effect can change in some instances depending on the magnitude of a key variable or parameter which leads to a threshold change in system structure and dynamics. By considering alternative structures of a community, we extend our ability to model perturbations that move the system far from a previous equilibrium. Using specific examples, we reinterpret existing results, develop hypotheses to guide experiments or management interventions, and explore the role of modified interactions and positive feedback in creating and maintaining alternative stable states.

We tested whether disturbance has led to spatial homogenization or heterogenization, and to decoupling or strengthening of community-environment relationships.We used a reconstruction of pre-industrial tree communities based on historical land survey records (1854-1935), together with modern data, to assess changes in tree beta-diversity patterns. Then, beta-diversity was partitioned into fractions explained by spatial (dbMEM) and environmental variables (latitude, elevation, slope, drainage and surface deposits) in order to assess changes in spatial structures and community-environment relationships.In pre-industrial times, environmental variables explained only a small proportion of beta-diversity since dominant taxa were present across the range of environmental gradients, whereas habitat specialists were very rare. Between pre-industrial and modern times, our analysis highlights an increase in beta-diversity and the proportion of beta-diversity that was explained by environmental variables. Increased disturbance rates have favored early-successional habitat specialist taxa and reduced the habitat breadth of pre-industrial generalists, thereby increasing the strength of community-environment relationships.Our results support that disturbance can alter the strength of community-environment relationships and also suggest that functional traits of species within the regional pool could predict whether or not disturbance alters such relationships.",10.1007/s10980-017-0591-y,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Since fire is considered a key factor in Neotropical savannas, we investigated to what extent the functional effects of fire in a Brazilian savanna occurs via intra- or interspecific trait variability. We sampled 12 traits in communities subjected to three fire regimes in the last 12 years: annual, biennial, and protected. To evaluate fire's relative effects, we fitted a general linear mixed models with species as random and fire as fixed factors, using: (1) all species in the communities (i.e., considering intra- and interspecific variabilities); (2) 18 species common to all fire regimes (i.e., intraspecific variability only); and (3) all species with their overall average trait values (i.e., interspecific variability only). We assessed the relative role of intra- or interspecific variability by comparing the significance of each trait in the three analyses. We also compared the within and between fire variabilities with a variance component analysis. Five traits presented larger intraspecific than interspecific variability, and the main effect of fire occurred at the intraspecific level. These results confirm that it is important to consider intraspecific variability to fully understand fire-prone communities. Moreover, trait variability was larger within than among fire regimes. Thus, fire may act more as an external filter, preventing some of the species from the regional pool from colonizing the cerrado, than as an internal factor structuring the already filtered cerrado communities.",10.1007/s00442-012-2431-8,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,1,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = plant height, basal area, bark thickness, wood density, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur in leaves.",

In this study, we use a trait-based null modelling approach to test for evidence of deterministic assembly of species according to flowering time in an old-field plant community. Plant species coexisting in one-metre-square plots overlapped in flowering time significantly more than expected. This flowering synchrony was more pronounced when analyses focused on bee-pollinated species. Flowering synchrony was also observed for wind-pollinated species, although for only one of our two null model tests, highlighting the sensitivity of some results to different randomization methods. In general, these patterns suggest that relationships between pollinators and plants can influence community assembly processes. Because our study community is composed of approximately 43% native plant species and 57% exotic species, and because the arrival of new species may complicate plantpollinator interactions, we tested whether flowering time overlap was altered by introduced species. Flowering synchrony was greater in plots with a higher proportion of introduced species. This pattern held for both null model tests, but was slightly stronger when analyses focused on bee-pollinated species. These results indicate that introduced species alter community flowering distributions and in so doing will inevitably affect pollinatorplant interactions. Finally, we tested whether our results were influenced by variation among study plots in above-ground biomass production, which some theory predicts will be related to the importance of competition. Our results were not influenced by this variation, suggesting that resource variation among our plots did not contribute to observed patterns. Synthesis: Our results provide support for predictions that coexisting species should display flowering synchrony, and provide no support for species coexistence via temporal niche partitioning at this scale in this study community. Our results also indicate that introduced species significantly alter the community assembly process such that flowering synchrony is more pronounced in plots with a greater proportion of introduced plant species.",10.1111/1365-2435.12061,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Meanwhile, molecular studies are increasingly revealing morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species with presumably similar ecological roles. Determining the geographic distribution of such cryptic species provides opportunities to contrast predictions of niche vs. neutral models. Discovery of sympatric cryptic species increases alpha diversity and supports neutral models, while documentation of allopatric/parapatric cryptic species increases beta diversity and supports niche models. We tested these predictions using morphological and molecular data, coupled with environmental niche modelling analyses, of a fig wasp community along its 2700-km latitudinal range. Molecular methods increased previous species diversity estimates from eight to eleven species, revealing morphologically cryptic species in each of the four wasp genera studied. Congeneric species pairs that were differentiated by a key morphological functional trait (ovipositor length) coexisted sympatrically over large areas. In contrast, morphologically similar species, with similar ovipositor lengths, typically showed parapatric ranges with very little overlap. Despite parapatric ranges, environmental niche models of cryptic congeneric pairs indicate large regions of potential sympatry, suggesting that competitive processes are important in determining the distributions of ecologically similar species. Niche processes appear to structure this insect community, and cryptic diversity may typically contribute mostly to beta rather than alpha diversity.",10.1111/mec.13985,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Observational/Q Model,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = ovipositor length, body size",

Natural sounds also have the potential to affect the behaviour and ecology of animals, but it is currently unknown if the effects of natural sounds match those of anthropogenic sounds. Here, we quantified and compared the effects of natural and anthropogenic sounds on avian song performance by calculating trade-off frontiers based on trill rate and bandwidth of 2 emberizid species. Chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina) and white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia luecophrys) were recorded in areas with and without anthropogenic sound and along a natural sounds gradient generated from ocean surf, respectively. We analysed individuals' song performance relative to the trade-off frontier and found that both species vocalizing in environments with louder background sounds sang songs that were significantly further below the trade-off frontier than songs sung by birds in quiet settings. Chipping sparrows vocalizing in noisy areas sang almost twice as far below the trade-off frontier than individuals in quiet areas, and white-crowned sparrow song performance declined by similar to 25% with each 3 dB(A) increase in environmental sounds, or halving the size of a signaller's listening area. These results suggest that natural and anthropogenic sounds can have a significant effect on song performance, a trait known to influence the outcome of male-male contests and influence female mate choices. Considering that natural sounds are pervasive, quiet acoustic refuges may be far more important than previously thought, and anthropogenic development may be infringing on larger portions of prime habitat than we realize.",10.1093/beheco/arx036,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

These differential responses have been shown to result in ecological mismatches that can have negative fitness consequences. However, the ways in which climate change has shaped changes in biodiversity within and across communities are not well understood. Here, we build on our previous results that established a link between plant species' phenological response to climate change and a phylogenetic bias in species' decline in the eastern United States. We extend a similar approach to plant and bird communities in the United States and the UK that further demonstrates that climate change has differentially impacted species based on their phylogenetic relatedness and shared phenological responses. In plants, phenological responses to climate change are often shared among closely related species (i.e. clades), even between geographically disjunct communities. And in some cases, this has resulted in a phylogenetically biased pattern of non-native species success. In birds, the pattern of decline is phylogenetically biased but is not solely explained by phenological response, which suggests that other traits may better explain this pattern. These results illustrate the ways in which phylogenetic thinking can aid in making generalizations of practical importance and enhance efforts to predict species' responses to future climate change.",10.1098/rstb.2010.0130,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Multiple,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = birds & plants.

Restoration of degraded plant communities requires understanding of community assembly processes. Human land use can influence plant community assembly by altering environmental conditions and species' dispersal patterns. Flooding, including from environmental flows, may counteract land use effects on wetland vegetation. We examined the influence of land use history and flood frequency on the functional composition of wetland plant communities along a regulated river. 2. We applied fourth corner modelling to determine species' trait-based responses to flooding and land use by combining data on (i) the occupancy and abundance of species in propagule banks and standing vegetation, (ii) species traits, and (iii) environmental conditions of 22 standing vegetation and 108 soil propagule bank study sites. We used analysis of deviance to test how well each dataset characterised trait-environment interactions, and generalised linear models to identify traits related to species' responses. 3. The occupancy and abundance of native species in the propagule bank and standing vegetation increased with flood frequency and decreased with duration of agricultural land use. Species in standing vegetation with water-borne propagule dispersal (hydrochory) showed similar trends. In contrast, species with higher specific leaf area were associated with longer land use duration. 4. Identifying trait-based differences in the propagule bank and standing vegetation can help disentangle effects of dispersal and environmental filters. The occupancy and abundance of hydrochorous species in standing vegetation were negatively related to land use duration, but hydrochorous species were positively related to land use duration based on their abundance in the propagule bank. This suggests that land use does not limit plant dispersal, but acts as an insitu abiotic filter, limiting species present in standing vegetation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Land use duration and flood frequency have opposite effects on plant community traits in floodplain wetlands of the Macquarie Marshes, Australia. Legacies of agriculture can impede restoration of plant communities. Environmental flows that increase flooding may alleviate these impacts, especially in areas that have been used for agriculture for over 20years, by providing dispersal and environmental filters that favour native wetland species. More flooding will likely be required to restore floodplains with longer histories of agricultural land use compared to floodplains less impacted by agriculture.",10.1111/1365-2664.12922,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Plants,Wetland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,P,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = SLA, seed mass, native provenance, primary dispersal mode, longevity, woody",
"Daza, RC; Korb, J",2019,Phylogenetic Community Structure and Niche Differentiation in Termites of the Tropical Dry Forests of Colombia,INSECTS,"The mechanisms that structure species communities are still debated. We addressed this question for termite assemblages from tropical dry forests in Colombia. These forests are endangered and poorly understood ecosystems and termites are important ecosystem engineers in the tropics. Using biodiversity and environmental data, combined with phylogenetic community analyses, trait mapping, and stable isotopes studies, we investigated the termite community composition of three protected dry forests in Colombia. Our data suggest that the structuring mechanisms differed between sites. Phylogenetic overdispersion of termite assemblages correlated with decreasing rainfall and elevation and increasing temperature. Food niche traitsclassified as feeding groups and quantified by N-15 parts per thousand and C-13 parts per thousand isotope signatureswere phylogenetically conserved. Hence, the overdispersion pattern implies increasing interspecific competition with decreasing drier and warmer conditions, which is also supported by fewer species occurring at the driest site. Our results are in line with a hypothesis that decreased biomass production limits resource availability for termites, which leads to competition. Along with this comes a diet shift: termites from drier plots had higher C-13 signatures, reflecting higher C-13 values in the litter and more C4 plants. Our study shows how a phylogenetic community approach combined with trait analyses can contribute to gaining the first insights into mechanisms structuring whole termite assemblages.",10.3390/insects10040103,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Tropical Seasonal Forest,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = feeding group, stable isotope mean of C and N values",

Forest recovery following management interventions is important to maintain ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. It remains, however, largely unclear how above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery of species-rich tropical forests is affected by disturbance intensity and post-disturbance (remaining) tree-community attributes, following logging and thinning interventions.2. We investigated whether annual AGB increment (Delta AGB) decreases with management-related disturbance intensity (disturbance hypothesis), and increases with the diversity (niche-complementarity hypothesis) and the community-weighted mean (CWM) of acquisitive traits of dominant species (biomass-ratio hypothesis) in the remaining tree community.3. We analysed data from a long-term forest-management experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over two recovery periods: post-logging (1983-1989) and post-thinning (1995-2012). We computed the Delta AGB of surviving trees, recruit trees and of the total tree community. Disturbance intensity was quantified as basal area reduction and basal area remaining. Remaining diversity (taxonomic, functional and structural) and CWM of five functional traits linked to biomass productivity (specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorous concentration, leaf toughness and wood density) were calculated for the post-intervention inventories. Predictors were related to response variables using multiple linear regressions and structural equation modelling.4. We found support for the disturbance hypothesis in both recovery periods. AGB increment of survivors and of the total tree community increased with basal area remaining, indicating the importance of remaining growing stock for biomass recovery. Conversely, AGB increment of recruit trees increased with basal area reduction because changes in forest structure increased resource availability for young trees. We did not find consistent support for the niche-complementarity and biomass-ratio hypotheses, possibly because of a high redundancy in these extremely species-rich forests.5. Synthesis and applications. The intensity of disturbance through management, expressed as basal area reduction and basal area remaining, was consistently more important for explaining forest biomass recovery following harvesting and thinning than remaining diversity or trait composition. This points to the importance of controlling logging and thinning intensity in forests of the eastern Amazon. Given the high intervention intensities applied in this experiment, it is likely that low to moderate harvesting intensities permitted by the current legislation for the Brazilian Amazon (30 m(3)/ha) will not impair biomass recovery in these forests.",10.1111/1365-2664.13134,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,,

It has been recommended that both functional and phylogenetic information should be combined, and some researchers have even suggested that functional information for species should be 'corrected' because species are not phylogenetically independent. Here, we address these issues by identifying key types of questions in functional trait-based ecology and discussing the utility of phylogenetic information for answering them, either as a correction or in combination with functional traits. Phylogenetic analyses are identified as essential to answer questions related to the evolution of adaptations to abiotic and biotic conditions. However, we argue that phylogenetic information is not always relevant for functional trait studies, and should not be incorporated into ecological analyses without clear justification. Phylogenetic relatedness between species should not be considered a bias to be corrected, but rather an evolutionary signal that allows results to be interpreted at different evolutionary scales. Furthermore, if traits are conserved, phylogeny can be used as a proxy for missing information on traits and functional trait diversity. We conclude by providing guidelines on when to apply, and how to interpret, results obtained using phylogenetic information for a variety of ecological questions linked to functional traits.",10.1007/s12224-015-9228-6,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Functional traits and phylogeny offer different, and often complementary, information about ecological differences between species, an essential step to uncover biodiversity assembly mechanisms and their feedbacks to ecosystem functions. However, traits and phylogeny are often related due to underlying trait evolution. Consequently, when combined, their shared information can be overemphasized, hindering their complementarity. It is therefore desirable to decouple their unique and overlapping contributions. 2. We propose a conceptual and mathematical framework that produces a set of meaningful measures of ecological differences between species. 3. We test the properties of these measures and the validity of the approach with extensive simulated data to show (i) the information provided by decoupling traits from phylogeny and vice versa, and (ii) that decoupling trait and phylogenetic information can uncover otherwise hidden signals underlying species coexistence and turnover. The application of the approach is further illustrated using a large dataset of Central European meadows as a case study. 4. Decoupling traits and phylogeny particularly reveals the importance of differentiation between phylogenetically related species, which can be essential to understand species replacements along environmental gradients and the combined action of environmental filtering and limiting similarity within communities. 5. Decoupling traits and phylogeny provides an avenue for connecting macro-evolutionary and local factors affecting coexistence and for understanding how complex species differences affect multiple ecosystem functions.

To analyse brown trout habitat suitability, we therefore combined the relative importance of the food availability (overall abundance of benthic and drifting invertebrates), with the potential food vulnerability (accessibility, conspicuousness and ease of handling), the latter depending on both physical habitat characteristics (flow patterns and structural complexity of habitat) and invertebrate traits (size and other biological traits). We considered the trophic patterns of trout at two spatial scales: the reach scale (unregulated reach versus regulated reach) and the macrohabitat scale (e.g. riffles and pools). Discharge regulation reduced trout abundance, biomass, and temperature-independent growth rates. In the regulated reach, trout had a lower total prey consumption, a higher consumption of terrestrial There were no macrohabitat-specific differences in the total prey consumption and in the potential food availability within each reach. However, brown trout diets differed between the macrohabitats of each reach, in relation to differences in potential invertebrate vulnerability, invertebrates and a higher diet diversity than in the unregulated reach, indicating that trout were food-limited. However, the potential availability of food supplies per individual trout was similar for the two reaches. Thus, trout prey consumption in the regulated reach should have been predominantly affected by the decrease in both the availability of large invertebrates in the drift and their vulnerability in the total food supplies. There were no macrohabitat-specific differences in the total prey consumption and in the potential food availability within each reach. However, brown trout diets differed between the macrohabitats of each reach, in relation to differences in potential invertebrate vulnerability. Therefore, the potential vulnerability of invertebrates to predation was more relevant in the ecological evaluation of salmonid habitat suitability than the total food availability. The analysis at the macrohabitat scale provided a better understanding of the switches in brown trout diet and enabled a finer and more realistic analysis of trout feeding patterns.

Identifying the spatial scale that most influences the species-environment relationships is a major goal of community ecology. We evaluated the importance of catchment and site scales and associated environmental variables in shaping Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in Neotropical savanna headwater streams. Sampling sites were associated with 20 catchment-scale variables that depicted land cover and land use as well as natural geophysical variables such as altitude and climate. Site-scale habitat was characterised by 55 variables that described habitat hydromorphology, substrate, flow, canopy, in-stream cover and water quality. EPT traits were assessed using 28 categories of 7 biological traits, which represented the best available current knowledge for EPT in Neotropical savanna streams. We analysed the relationships between the catchment- and site-scale habitat variables and the taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages using 1,760 samples collected in 160 stream sites. Catchment- and site-scale variables both explained significant variation in EPT taxon and trait composition. Substrate, habitat hydromorphology and land use most influenced variation in taxonomic composition, whereas trait composition was mainly affected by land use. Catchment geographic position explained less assemblage variation.

One of those possible pitfalls - collinearity among environmental predictors - is assumed as an important source of model uncertainty, although it has not been subjected to a detailed evaluation in recent SDM studies. It is expected that collinearity will increase uncertainty in model parameters and decrease statistical power. Here we use a virtual species approach to compare models built using subsets of PCA-derived variables with models based on the original highly correlated climate variables. Moreover, we evaluated whether modelling algorithms and species data characteristics generate models with varying sensitivity to collinearity. As expected, collinearity among predictors decreases the efficiency and increases the uncertainty of species distribution models. Nevertheless, the intensity of the effect varied according to the algorithm properties: more complex procedures behaved better than simple envelope models. This may support the claim that complex models such as Maxent take advantage of existing collinearity in finding the best set of parameters. The interaction of the different factors with species characteristics (centroid and tolerance in environmental space) highlighted the importance of the so-called ""idiosyncrasy in species responses"" to model efficiency, but differences in prevalence may represent a better explanation. However, even models with low accuracy to predict suitability of individual cells may provide meaningful information on the estimation of range-size, a key species-trait for macroecological studies. We concluded that the use of PCA-derived variables is advised both to control the negative effects of collinearity and as a more objective solution for the problem of variable selection in studies dealing with large number of species with heterogeneous responses to environmental variables.",10.1371/journal.pone.0202403,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

To assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have collated from the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity at sites facing land-use change and intensification, and assess whether bee responses to these pressures vary across 11 regions (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe; North, Central and South America; Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia; Middle and Southern Africa) and between bumblebees and other bees.

Such pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning. We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70056 records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and traitxland-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats.Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in particular, conversion to urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination services.

An occurrence matrix containing 44 localities and 20 species was build from data sets of different studies carried out in Haute Normandie (France). The whole data set included species lists from the three main landscape units and from a range of land use types from unmanaged forests and grasslands to intensive pastures and annual crops. We used species pool, multivariate (correspondence analysis) and null model analyse to explore how species occurring in a given community are sorted from the regional species pool. Special attention was paid to identifying non-randomness in co-occurrence and morpho-ecological patterns and to describing community patterns in response to habitat constraints. Twenty species of Lumbricidae were identified in the total species pool. We found no significant effect of landscape units on species richness and density, while land use type had a significant impact on both variables, with the lowest values in crops and forests, and the highest values in grasslands. Correspondence analysis highlighted how broad land use types, soil gradients and land use intensity influence patterns of community composition and ecological coherence. Non-random patterns in guild proportion were found in a few situations, with differences between grasslands and forests. This shows that environmental filters select species at specific scales according to particular ecological traits, resulting in a convergence of these traits between species of a given community. Local species richness never exceeded nine species and species co-occurrence was significantly lower than expected by chance and much lower than described in the literature for other taxa. Although no significant patterns of limiting similarity were observed at the scale of our study, we conclude that earthworm communities are also highly structured by competition. Our study thus agrees with the idea that both habitat and competitive constraints operate simultaneously to determine how community assembly takes place. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely tested, and in some systems, gradients of predation risk may more accurately characterize spatial variation in vital rates than gradients described by habitat selection studies. Here, we separately measured spatial patterns of both resource selection and predation risk and tested their relationships with a key demographic trait, adult female survival, for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin). We also evaluated whether exposure to gradients in both predation risk and resource selection value was manifested temporally through instantaneous or seasonal effects on survival outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards spatial survival modelling to assess the relative support for 5 selection- and risk-based definitions of habitat quality, as quantified by woodland caribou adult female survival. These hypotheses included scenarios in which selection ideally mirrored survival, risk entirely drove survival, non-ideal selection correlated with survival but with additive risk effects, an ecological trap with maladaptive selection and a non-spatial effect of annual variation in weather. Indeed, we found positive relationships between the predicted values of a resource selection function (RSF) and survival, yet subsequently incorporating an additional negative effect of predation risk greatly improved models further. This revealed a positive, but non-ideal relationship between selection and survival. Gradients in these covariates were also shown to affect individual survival probability at multiple temporal scales. Exposure to increased predation risk had a relatively instantaneous effect on survival outcomes, whereas variation in habitat suitability predicted by an RSF had both instantaneous and longer-term seasonal effects on survival. Predation risk was an additive source of hazard beyond that detected through selection alone, and woodland caribou selection thus was shown to be non-ideal.

The aim of this paper was to determine the climatic factors and the inter-and intra-specific competition traits that drive intra-annual secondary growth dynamics in three Mediterranean tree species that naturally co-exist in the Spanish Northern Plateau (Pinus pinea L., Juniperus thurifera L., and Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.). For this purpose, we obtained girth increment data from band dendrometers installed on 58 trees from May 2012 to April 2015. Half of them were located in a high-density plot and half were in a low-density plot. These data were analysed through a nonlinear multifactorial model considering daily and cumulative climatic effects together with inter-and intra-specific competition indices. Our results provide evidence of a spatiotemporal niche separation between species. Compared with other species, Q. ilex subsp. ballota showed a wider thermal amplitude, a higher mean optimum temperature for growth, and a milder effect of drought on its secondary growth.

To identify possible mechanisms that influence avian species assemblages in the tropical Andes, we studied the functional and phylogenetic diversity and the structure of species assemblages of an avian feeding guild. We analysed how functional and phylogenetic diversity, structure and composition of frugivorous bird assemblages changed along a 3300 m elevational transect from the lowlands to the tree line with a novel combination of functional and phylogenetic approaches, and used null models to infer possible drivers of the observed patterns. Species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased almost monotonically with increasing elevation, but assemblage structure and composition changed abruptly in the Andean foothills at around 1200 m. In the lowland assemblages, species were functionally and phylogenetically less similar than expected from null models, whereas species in the highland assemblages were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance, suggesting an abrupt reduction in the number of functionally and phylogenetically distinct species in the transition from lowlands to the highlands. Nevertheless, the functional and phylogenetic evenness of the assemblages, i.e. the regularity of the spacing of species in functional trait space and phylogeny, remained constant along the gradient, which suggests that the mechanisms that influence the co-occurrence of species within the assemblages are similar in lowlands and highlands. The observed differences between lowland and highland assemblages imply sharp distributional limits for frugivorous bird species in the Andean foothills, probably caused by environmental factors other than climate, e.g. changes in habitat types or topography, or independent species radiations in lowlands and highlands. These strong distributional limits may hinder uphill range shifts of frugivorous bird species, and the plant species they disperse, in the tropical Andes as a response to climate change.",10.1111/ecog.00623,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Birds,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = beak length height and width, wing length, tail length, Kipp's distance (distance from the tip of the first secondary to the wing tip), tarsus length, sagittal and laterual diameter of tarsus",

An interaction between resource and consumer species usually requires trait matching (e.g. a congruence in the morphologies of interaction partners). Species' morphology should therefore determine species' functional roles in ecological processes mediated by mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. We tested this assumption for Neotropical plant-bird mutualisms. We used a new analytical framework that assesses a species's functional role based on the analysis of the traits of its interaction partners in a multidimensional trait space. We employed this framework to test (i) whether there is correspondence between the morphology of bird species and their functional roles and (ii) whether morphologically specialized birds fulfil specialized functional roles. We found that morphological differences between bird species reflected their functional differences: (i) bird species with different morphologies foraged on distinct sets of plant species and (ii) morphologically distinct bird species fulfilled specialized functional roles.

"Dell, AI; Pawar, S; Savage, V",2014,Temperature dependence of trophic interactions are driven by asymmetry of species responses and foraging strategy,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"Environmental temperature has systematic effects on rates of species interactions, primarily through its influence on organismal physiology. We present a mechanistic model for the thermal response of consumer-resource interactions. We focus on how temperature affects species interactions via key traits - body velocity, detection distance, search rate and handling time - that underlie per capita consumption rate. The model is general because it applies to all foraging strategies: active-capture (both consumer and resource body velocity are important), sit-and-wait (resource velocity dominates) and grazing (consumer velocity dominates). The model predicts that temperature influences consumer-resource interactions primarily through its effects on body velocity (either of the consumer, resource or both), which determines how often consumers and resources encounter each other, and that asymmetries in the thermal responses of interacting species can introduce qualitative, not just quantitative, changes in consumer-resource dynamics. We illustrate this by showing how asymmetries in thermal responses determine equilibrium population densities in interacting consumer-resource pairs. We test for the existence of asymmetries in consumer-resource thermal responses by analysing an extensive database on thermal response curves of ecological traits for 309 species spanning 15 orders of magnitude in body size from terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. We find that asymmetries in consumer-resource thermal responses are likely to be a common occurrence. Overall, our study reveals the importance of asymmetric thermal responses in consumer-resource dynamics. In particular, we identify three general types of asymmetries: (i) different levels of performance of the response, (ii) different rates of response (e.g. activation energies) and (iii) different peak or optimal temperatures. Such asymmetries should occur more frequently as the climate changes and species' geographical distributions and phenologies are altered, such that previously noninteracting species come into contact. By using characteristics of trophic interactions that are often well known, such as body size, foraging strategy, thermy and environmental temperature, our framework should allow more accurate predictions about the thermal dependence of consumer-resource interactions. Ultimately, integration of our theory into models of food web and ecosystem dynamics should be useful in understanding how natural systems will respond to current and future temperature change.",10.1111/1365-2656.12081,Y,0,0,0,0,0,0,T Model,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,,"Traits = body velocity, detection distance, search rate and handling time",

The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87% are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 +/- 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle-stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 +/- 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed.

Both are endemic to the Gulf of California, being derived from taxa on the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula, and both exhibit phenotypic plasticity for traits affecting their coevolutionary interactions. Consistent with expectations based on differences in dispersal, C. anisopoma populations generally lack geographic structure, while those of M. l. angelica are more strongly structured. However, the variable degree of differentiation in both species suggests that the extent of reciprocal selection and local adaptation in the species will vary geographically, a result consistent with the concept of a geographic mosaic of coevolution. The pattern of variation in C. anisopoma shows clear evidence of recent spatial expansion, possibly due to increased habitat availability following the last glacial maximum. Phylogeographic analyses suggest that M. l. angelica diversified into three distinct clades after the colonization of the Gulf.

We examined the relative roles played by the physical and biological environment, and by purely spatial processes, in shaping the composition and diversities of these vertebrate assemblages. Then, based on the theory that the Guianan forest cover shrank to isolated pockets during the late Pleistocene-Holocene, we tested if the past forest refugia may have shaped current vertebrate assemblages. Location: French Guiana, Guiana Shield, South America. Methods: Abundances of 19 medium- and large-sized vertebrates were estimated at 21 locations in undisturbed Guianan rain forests. Using taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic metrics, we partitioned the effects of a range of physical and biological environmental conditions and purely spatial predictors in shaping both assemblage composition and (alpha and beta) diversities. Results: We identified a significant, but weak relationship between taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic assemblage composition and environmental conditions. Assemblage diversity patterns were mainly explained by spatial predictors irrespective of the metrics. Current assemblage diversities are correlated with Pleistocene-Holocene forest history, with the highest alpha diversities outside of putative forest refugia, and the highest beta diversities inside these areas. Main conclusions: Current vertebrate assemblage composition is not strongly marked by common environmental factors. Our main conclusion is that assemblage composition results from individual species responses to the environment. Our findings also suggest that dispersal-related processes or more probably historical processes shape (alpha and beta) diversity patterns. In fact, forest fragmentation during Pleistocene-Holocene climate changes could have led to isolated vertebrate assemblages evolving into unique species assemblages creating the current high beta diversity inside refugia, whereas the lower habitat stability outside of refugia could have led to mixed assemblages in areas recolonized by forest vertebrates (current high alpha diversity outside of refugia).",10.1111/ddi.12790,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Broad,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = body mass, body size, size of home range, mean group size, habitat preference, diet",

When heterochrony produces polymorphisms, it offers the possibility to test hypotheses that could explain its success across environments. Amphibians are particularly suitable to exploring these questions because they express complex life cycles (i.e. metamorphosis) that have been disrupted by heterochronic processes (paedomorphosis: retention of larval traits in adults). The large phenotypic variation across populations suggests that more complex processes than expected are operating, but they remain to be investigated through multivariate analyses over a large range of natural populations across time. In this study, we compared the likelihood of multiple potential environmental determinants of heterochrony. We gathered data on the proportion of paedomorphic and metamorphic palmate newts (Lissotriton helveticus) across more than 150 populations during 10years and used an information-theoretic approach to compare the support of multiple potential processes. Six environmental processes jointly explained the proportion of paedomorphs in populations: predation, water availability, dispersal limitation, aquatic breathing, terrestrial habitat suitability and antipredator refuges. Analyses of variation across space and time supported models based on the advantage of paedomorphosis in favourable aquatic habitats. Paedomorphs were favoured in deep ponds, in conditions favourable to aquatic breathing (high oxygen content), with lack of fish and surrounded by suitable terrestrial habitat. Metamorphs were favoured by banks allowing easy dispersal. These results indicate that heterochrony relies on complex processes involving multiple ecological variables and exemplifies why heterochronic patterns occur in contrasted environments. On the other hand, the fast selection of alternative morphs shows that metamorphosis and paedomorphosis developmental modes could be easily disrupted in natural populations.",10.1111/1365-2656.12173,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Obersational,Freshwater,Other,Grassland,0,0,0,1,0,Life History,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,Taxonomic = amphibeans.

Therefore, such approaches are especially inadequate for prediction of the overall impact of insecticides on beneficial arthropods. In this study, the side effects of four modern insecticides (chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, spinosad, and spirotetramat) on Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were evaluated under laboratory conditions by exposition on treated potted plants. In addition to investigation of acute toxicity and persistence of harmful activity in both larvae and adults of A. bipunctata, demographic parameters were evaluated, to provide a comprehensive picture of the nontarget effects of these products. Field doses of the four insecticides caused detrimental effects to A. bipunctata; but in different ways. Overall, spinosad showed the best toxicological profile among the products tested. Emamectin benzoate could be considered a low-risk insecticide, but had high persistence. Chlorantraniliprole exhibited lethal effects on early instar larvae and adults, along with a long-lasting activity, instead spirotetramat showed a low impact on larval and adult mortality and can be considered a short-lived insecticide. However, demographic analysis demonstrated that chlorantraniliprole and spirotetramat caused sub-lethal effects. Our findings highlight that sole assessment of mortality can lead to underestimation of the full impact of pesticides on nontarget insects. Demographic analysis was demonstrated to be a sensitive method for detection of the sub-lethal effects of insecticides on A. bipunctata, and this approach should be considered for evaluation of insecticide selectivity.",10.1093/jee/tox243,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

We experimentally manipulated functional identity and diversity of grassland insect herbivores and tested their impact on plant community biomass. Herbivore resource acquisition traits, i.e. mandible strength and the diversity of mandibular traits, had more important effects on plant biomass than body size. Higher herbivore functional diversity increased overall impact on plant biomass due to feeding niche complementarity. Higher plant functional diversity limited biomass pre-emption by herbivores.

More precisely, we show that a monomorphic population can evolve toward high levels of cannibalism until it reaches a so-called branching point, where the population splits into two sub-populations characterized by different, but initially very close, cannibalistic traits. Then, the two traits coevolve until the more cannibalistic sub-population undergoes evolutionary extinction. Finally, the remaining population evolves back to the branching point, thus closing an evolutionary cycle. The model on which the study is based is purely deterministic and derived through the adaptive dynamics approach. Evolutionary dynamics are investigated through numerical bifurcation analysis, applied both to the ecological (resident-mutant) model and to the evolutionary model.

"DeSoto, L; Torices, R; Rodriguez-Echeverria, S; Nabais, C",2017,Variation in seed packaging of a fleshy-fruited conifer provides insights into the ecology and evolution of multi-seeded fruits,PLANT BIOLOGY,"The study of intraspecific seed packaging (i.e. seed size/number strategy) variation across different populations may allow better understanding of the ecological forces that drive seed evolution in plants. Juniperus thurifera (Cupressaceae) provides a good model to study this due to the existence of two subspecies differentiated by phenotypic traits, such as seed size and cone seediness (number of seeds inside a cone), across its range. The aim of this study was to analyse seed packaging (seed mass and cone seediness) variation at different scales (subspecies, populations and individuals) and the relationship between cone and seed traits in European and African J. thurifera populations. After opening more than 5300 cones and measuring 3600 seeds, we found that seed packaging traits followed different patterns of variation. Large-scale effects (region and population) significantly contributed to cone seediness variance, while most of the seed mass variance occurred within individuals. Seed packaging differed between the two sides of the Mediterranean Sea, with African cones bearing fewer but larger seeds than the European ones. However, no differences in seed mass were found between populations when taking into account cone seediness. Larger cones contained more pulp and seeds and displayed a larger variation in individual seed mass. We validated previous reports on the intraspecific differences in J. thurifera seed packaging, although both subspecies followed the same seed size/number trade-off. The higher seediness and variation in seed mass found in larger cones reveals that the positive relationship between seed and cone sizes may not be straightforward.We hypothesise that the large variation of seed size found within cones and individuals in J. thurifera, but also in other fleshy-fruited species, could represent a bet-hedging strategy for dispersal.",10.1111/plb.12566,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Seasonal Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,1,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = seed size, number of viable seeds within a cone, total seed mass, diameter of cone, pulp mass per individual seed, percentage of cone mass corresponding to pulp, ",

Fearfulness is a temperament trait that characterizes the propensity of an individual to be frightened by a variety of alarming events. The aim of this study was to investigate a putative alteration of fearfulness in sheep repeatedly exposed to various aversive events. Forty-eight 5-month-old female lambs were used. Over a period of 6 weeks, 24 of them (treated group) were exposed daily to various unpredictable and uncontrollable aversive events related to predatory cues, social context and negative handling that can occur under farming conditions. The other 24 lambs (control group) were housed in standard farming conditions (predictable food distribution and group handling). Fearfulness (behavioural and physiological responses) was assessed before and after the treatment period by subjecting the lambs to three standardized tests: individual exposure to suddenness and then to novelty in a test arena, and group exposure to a motionless human in the home pen. As biomarkers of stress, leukocyte counts, heart rate and cortisol concentrations were measured in the lambs in their home pens. Before the treatment, the emotional responses of the groups did not differ. After the treatment, treated lambs approached the human less often, had less contact with the novel object and vocalized more than controls in individual tests, suggesting that long-term exposure to unpredictable and uncontrollable aversive events increases subsequent fearfulness in sheep. In addition, treated lambs had lower leukocyte counts, heart rate and cortisol levels, pointing to a chronic stress state. These findings suggest that increased fearfulness may be used as a sign of chronic stress in farm animals.",10.1017/S1751731112001796,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

In addition, alternative statistical analyses need to be explored that focus on comparison among several statistical models rather than simple hypothesis testing. Analyses of the first 2 years of data from a new biodiversity field experiment are used to illustrate these concepts. A traditional one-way ANOVA demonstrates the expected increase in aboveground biomass with higher levels of vascular plant diversity. Further analysis demonstrates that this relationship is absent when the community contains either Arrhenatherum elatius or Holcus lanatus, two dominant species of grass. Variance in biomass is also a function of diversity and both spatial and temporal heterogeneity are significant factors in the analysis despite precautions taken to minimize them.

"DeWitt, TJ; Langerhans, RB",2003,"Multiple prey traits, multiple predators: keys to understanding complex community dynamics",JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH,"Natural communities can be complex. Such complexity makes it difficult to discern the mechanisms generating community structure. In this paper we review concepts and issues related to linking functional and community studies while also including greater complexity into the experimental realm. These principles are primarily illustrated with case studies involving predation ecology in a freshwater snail-fish-crayfish model system. The system illustrates how predator impacts on prey are mediated by multiple prey traits, correlations between traits, functional trade-offs in predator defence, interactions between predators, and interactions with other community members. We argue for a pluralistic approach to investigating mechanisms of community structure; that is, an approach that integrates many subdisciplines of ecology and evolution. We discuss four main areas that when used together yield important insights on community structure. First, selection gradient analyses formally link functional and community ecology. This formalisation is shown to help identify targets of selection, estimate environment-specific mortality rates, and identify agents of selection in complex communities. Second, we encourage increased focus on emergent community properties (results not predicted based on pairwise species interactions). Third, we emphasise that a community, rather than a web of species interactions, may more profitably be viewed as a network of trait interactions. This trait-centred view makes clear how indirect community effects arise between species that do not interact physically. This perspective also leads to our fourth topic, the integration of phenotypes. Just as populations evolve co-adapted suites of traits, so too should individuals embody integrated trait correlations, termed 'trait integration', rather than randomly assembled collections of phenotypes. All the perspectives mentioned above suggest that investigations should focus on multiple traits and multiple environments simultaneously, rather than singular, atomised components of complex systems.

Despite ongoing research in food web ecology and functional biogeography, the links between food web structure, functional traits and environmental conditions across spatial scales remain poorly understood. Trophic niches, defined as the amount of energy and elemental space occupied by species and food webs, may help bridge this divide. 2. Here, we ask how the functional traits of species, the environmental conditions of habitats and the spatial scale of analysis jointly determine the characteristics of trophic niches. We used isotopic niches as a proxy of trophic niches, and conducted analyses at spatial scales ranging from local food webs and metacommunities to geographically distant sites. 3. We sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates from 104 tank bromeliads distributed across five sites from Central to South America and compiled the macroinvertebrates' functional traits and stable isotope values (delta N-15 and delta C-13). We assessed how isotopic niches within each bromeliad were influenced by the functional trait composition of their associated invertebrates and environmental conditions (i.e., habitat size, canopy cover [CC] and detrital concentration [DC]). We then evaluated whether the diet of dominant predators and, consequently, energy pathways within food webs reflected functional and environmental changes among bromeliads across sites. At last, we determined the extent to which the isotopic niches of macroinvertebrates within each bromeliad contributed to the metacommunity isotopic niches within each site and compared these metacommunity-level niches over biogeographic scales. 4. At the bromeliad level, isotopic niches increased with the functional richness of species in the food web and the DC in the bromeliad. The diet of top predators tracked shifts in prey biomass along gradients of CC and DC. Bromeliads that grew under heterogeneous CC displayed less trophic redundancy and therefore combined to form larger metacommunity isotopic niches. At last, the size of metacommunity niches depended on within-site heterogeneity in CC. 5. Our results suggest that the trophic niches occupied by food webs can predictably scale from local food webs to metacommunities to biogeographic regions. This scaling process is determined by both the functional traits of species and heterogeneity in environmental conditions.",10.1111/1365-2435.13142,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Multiple,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic  = macroinverts.

C.; Wilson, Rory P.",2018,Multi-dimensional Precision Livestock Farming: a potential toolbox for sustainable rangeland management,PEERJ,"Background. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a promising approach to minimize the conflicts between socio-economic activities and landscape conservation. However, its application on extensive systems of livestock production can be challenging. The main difficulties arise because animals graze on large natural pastures where they are exposed to competition with wild herbivores for heterogeneous and scarce resources, predation risk, adverse weather, and complex topography. Considering that the 91% of the world's surface devoted to livestock production is composed of extensive systems (i.e., rangelands), our general aim was to develop a PLF methodology that quantifies: (i) detailed behavioural patterns, (ii) feeding rate, and (iii) costs associated with different behaviours and landscape traits.Methods. For this, we used Merino sheep in Patagonian rangelands as a case study. We combined data from an animal-attached multi-sensor tag (tri-axial acceleration, tri-axial magnetometry, temperature sensor and Global Positioning System) with landscape layers from a Geographical Information System to acquire data. Then, we used high accuracy decision trees, dead reckoning methods and spatial data processing techniques to show how this combination of tools could be used to assess energy balance, predation risk and competition experienced by livestock through time and space.Results. The combination of methods proposed here are a useful tool to assess livestock behaviour and the different factors that influence extensive livestock production, such as topography, environmental temperature, predation risk and competition for heterogeneous resources. We were able to quantify feeding rate continuously through time and space with high accuracy and show how it could be used to estimate animal production and the intensity of grazing on the landscape. We also assessed the effects of resource heterogeneity (inferred through search times), and the potential costs associated with predation risk, competition, thermoregulation and movement on complex topography.Discussion. The quantification of feeding rate and behavioural costs provided by our approach could be used to estimate energy balance and to predict individual growth, survival and reproduction. Finally, we discussed how the information provided by this combination of methods can be used to develop wildlife-friendly strategies that also maximize animal welfare, quality and environmental sustainability.",10.7717/peerj.4867,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

We argue that many ecologically damaging invaders are characterised by their more efficient use of resources. Consequently, comparison of the classical 'functional response' (relationship between resource use and availability) between invasive and trophically analogous native species may allow prediction of invader ecological impact. We review the utility of species trait comparisons and the history and context of the use of functional responses in invasion ecology, then present our framework for the use of comparative functional responses. We show that functional response analyses, by describing the resource use of species over a range of resource availabilities, avoids many pitfalls of 'snapshot' assessments of resource use. Our framework demonstrates how comparisons of invader and native functional responses, within and between Type II and III functional responses, allow testing of the likely population-level outcomes of invasions for affected species. Furthermore, we describe how recent studies support the predictive capacity of this method; for example, the invasive 'bloody red shrimp' Hemimysis anomala shows higher Type II functional responses than native mysids and this corroborates, and could have predicted, actual invader impacts in the field. The comparative functional response method can also be used to examine differences in the impact of two or more invaders, two or more populations of the same invader, and the abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. parasitism) context-dependencies of invader impacts. Our framework may also address the previous lack of rigour in testing major hypotheses in invasion ecology, such as the 'enemy release' and 'biotic resistance' hypotheses, as our approach explicitly considers demographic consequences for impacted resources, such as native and invasive prey species. We also identify potential challenges in the application of comparative functional responses in invasion ecology. These include incorporation of numerical responses, multiple predator effects and trait-mediated indirect interactions, replacement versus non-replacement study designs and the inclusion of functional responses in risk assessment frameworks. In future, the generation of sufficient case studies for a meta-analysis could test the overall hypothesis that comparative functional responses can indeed predict invasive species impacts.",10.1007/s10530-013-0550-8,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,Don't actually talk about traits just functional response,
"Dieckmann, U; Heino, M; Parvinen, K",2006,The adaptive dynamics of function-valued traits,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"This study extends the framework of adaptive dynamics to function-valued traits. Such adaptive traits naturally arise in a great variety of settings: variable or heterogeneous environments, age-structured populations, phenotypic plasticity, patterns of growth and form, resource gradients, and in many other areas of evolutionary ecology. Adaptive dynamics theory allows analysing the long-term evolution of such traits under the density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection pressures resulting from feedback between evolving populations and their ecological environment. Starting from individual-based considerations, we derive equations describing the expected dynamics of a function-valued trait in asexually reproducing populations under mutation-limited evolution, thus generalizing the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics to function-valued traits. We explain in detail how to account for various kinds of evolutionary constraints on the adaptive dynamics of function-valued traits. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we present applications to two specific examples that address, respectively, the evolution of metabolic investment strategies along resource gradients, and the evolution of seasonal flowering schedules in temporally varying environments.

These invasions were accompanied by analogous reproductive and developmental traits such as large eggs and an abbreviated, lecithotrophic development. Here, we present the first empirical study on the evolution of reproductive and developmental traits that accompany the invasion of land by crabs. As crucial steps in the colonization, we identify the transitions of the larval nursery, first, from the marine plankton into landlocked-brackish nurseries and, second, into fresh water. During these invasions, the early life-cycle stages were facing new ecological conditions and selective agents. We test hypotheses on the evolution of egg size and the mode of development in relation to the larval ecology of recent species and draw conclusions on their evolutionary past. As a model we focus on the genus Sesarma, that colonized Jamaica relatively recently and comprises species with a larval development in marine, brackish and freshwater habitats. In addition, we compare representatives of the crab genera Armases, Sesarma and Uca that invaded brackish-nursery habitats independently. The analysis reveals that in each genus the transition from marine to brackish nurseries resulted in fewer and larger eggs, an abbreviated development and higher endotrophic potential of larvae, and a wider tolerance to physicochemical stress (salinity). Size at metamorphosis, however, did not change in brackish species, suggesting that it is constrained. Within the Sesarma-lineage, egg size increases considerably from marine to freshwater species. The duration of embryonic development, the size and endotrophic potential of larvae are positively correlated, but the duration of the larval phase is negatively correlated with egg size. Hypotheses suggesting that large eggs evolved as a response to limited food or intense predation are inadequate to explain the initial egg-size increase in brackish species. We suggest that the specific abiotic environment of the brackish nurseries ultimately selected for increased egg size. These particular larval nurseries of brackish species of Armases, Sesarma and Uca are nutrient rich but ephemeral habitats with unfavourable physicochemical conditions, which strongly favour a swift larval phase and possibly large body size and higher salinity-stress resistance of larvae. The reason for the further and substantial increase in egg size in freshwater species remains unknown. The 'food-limitation' hypothesis derived from laboratory experiments, however, is inadequate to explain this increase. Our results support general life-history hypotheses ('safe harbour' hypothesis) that predict the evolution of large eggs if postembryonic stages face high risk of mortality, but not the predicted positive relationship between egg size and instantaneous egg stage mortality. On the contrary, we find a negative relationship, suggesting that larger eggs are a 'safer harbour' than smaller eggs. We outline a scenario for the invasion of land by crabs and propose a two-step model: as a first step, an instant shift of the larval development from offshore into landlocked-brackish nurseries, and, as a second step, from there into freshwater nurseries.",10.1017/S0952836900002016,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Other,Intertidal,1,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = crabs.

N.; Thomas, Dawn K.; Hickling, Rachael; Dawnay, Nick",2007,Behavioural syndromes differ predictably between 12 populations of three-spined stickleback,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. Animals often differ in suites of correlated behaviours, comparable with how humans differ in personality. Constraints on the architecture of behaviour have been invoked to explain why such 'behavioural syndromes' exist. From an adaptationist viewpoint, however, behavioural syndromes should evolve only in those populations where natural selection has favoured such trait covariance, and they should therefore exist only in particular types of population.2. A comparative approach was used to examine this prediction of the adaptive hypothesis. We measured behavioural correlations in 12 different populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and assessed whether they indeed varied consistently according to the selective environment, where population was unit of analysis.3. For a sample of fry from each population, we measured five different behaviours within the categories of (i) aggression (towards conspecifics); (ii) general activity; and (iii) exploration-avoidance (of novel foods, novel environments and altered environments).4. We show that behavioural syndromes are not always the same in different types of stickleback population: the often-documented syndrome between aggressiveness, activity and exploratory behaviour existed only in large ponds where piscivorous predators were present. In small ponds where predators were absent, these behaviours were not (or only weakly) associated.5. Our findings imply that population variation in behavioural syndromes does not result from stochastic evolutionary processes, but may result instead from adaptive evolution of behaviour favouring what should prove to be optimal trait combinations.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01284.x,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Freshwater,Fish,Ponds,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = level of movement within area, aggression to conspecifics, Time to consume new food, difference in movement in the face of a predator.

"Dingemanse, NJ; Dochtermann, NA; Wright, J",2010,A method for exploring the structure of behavioural syndromes to allow formal comparison within and between data sets,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Research on behavioural syndromes (consistent individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours) requires formal statistical methods to describe and compare syndrome structures. We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations.

Previous studies have shown delta N-15 and delta C-13 values are affected by several biological and environmental factors during starvation, but the generality of the effect of starvation on delta N-15 and delta C-13 values has not yet been tested. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of starvation on delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of consumers, and the underlying factors that may explain the observed variation. The delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were calculated as the differences between the final delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of consumers (post-starvation) and the pre-starvation values on each experiment. Our meta-analysis showed a large variation in the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of consumers ( delta N-15 range: -0.82 to 4.30 parts per thousand; mean: 0.47% and delta C-13 range: -1.92 to 2.62 parts per thousand; mean: 0.01 parts per thousand). The delta N-15 values of most consumers increased along the length of the starvation period and were influenced by nitrogen excretion and thermoregulation types, probably because differences in nitrogen metabolism and thermoregulation affect nitrogen processing and excretion rates. None of our predictor variables accounted for the variation in delta C-13 values, which showed both increases and decreases due to fasting. Our findings suggest that starvation results in changes in consumer delta N-15 values which are mainly explained by the length of the fasting period and by nitrogen and energy metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms of the starvation effects on delta C-13 values seem to be more complex than previously thought.",10.1098/rsos.170633,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

For practical reasons, conceptual developments in community ecology are usually based on studies of a restricted systematic group. The cooperation of thirty or so specialists in the synthesis of long-term ecological research on the Upper Rhone River, France, provided a unique occasion to investigate relationships among species traits, the habitat utilization by species, the relationship between species traits and habitat, utilization, and trends of species traits and species richness in the framework of spatial-temporal habitat variability for 548 species of plants (Hyphomycetes, aquatic macrophytes, floodplain vegetation) and animals (Tricladida, Oligochaeta, several groups of Crustacea, Insecta and Vertebrata). 2. Using correspondence analysis, 100 modalities of eighteen species traits were examined; the resulting typology demonstrates that systematic groups are the most important elements for separating species traits such as size, fecundity of individuals, parental care, mobility, body form, and food type. Small species have an intermediate number of descendants per reproductive cycle and few reproductive cycles both per year and per individual; in contrast, large species have a high number of descendants per reproductive cycle and few reproductive cycles per year but many potential reproductive cycles per individual. 3. The analysis of habitat utilization in the Upper Rhone River and its floodplain by the 548 species demonstrated a vertical gradient separating interstitial from superficial habitats; a transverse gradient for superficial habitats from the main channel towards more terrestrial ones is also evident. 4. Because of a significant (P < 0.01) relationship between species traits and habitat utilization, traits such as size, fecundity of individuals, parental care, tolerance to variation in humidity, and respiration are arranged along the vertical and transverse habitat gradient. Size, the number of reproductive cycles per individual, and the tolerance to variation of humidity increases from permanent waters to temporary waters, aggrading habitats, and terrestrial habitats. 5. Species traits showed significant (P < 0. 01) trends in the framework of spatial-temporal habitat variability and were compared with predictions based on the river habitat templet. Although each habitat showed a mixture of species traits at low temporal and spatial variability, and at high variability sites, trends corresponded to predictions for three traits (number of descendants per reproductive cycle, number of reproductive cycles per individual, attachment to soil or substrate) along a gradient of increasing temporal poral habitat variability. 6. The species richness of each habitat within the Upper Rhone River and its floodplain significantly (P = 0.03) increased as the spatial variability of habitats increased but there is no statistical correlation between species richness and temporal variability. An alternative hypothesis predicting that fewer species per resource occur in temporally stable habitats is also not supported.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb01755.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Broad,River,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = potential size, potential # of descendents per reproductive cycel, attachement to soil or substrate, body flexibility, body form, # of reproductive cycles per year, # of reproductive cycles per individual, reproductive mode, reproductive period, parental care, distance tranvelled with current or distance travelled against current, variablility of habitat use, respiration, diet, potential for regeneration of an individual, resistant life stages, tolerance to variation in humidity",

Minimum flow increases in four regulated reaches of the French Rhone River modified the invertebrate and fish communities in a predictable way, as detailed in other articles of this Special Issue. We tested the ability of several fish and macroinvertebrate metrics currently used in bioassessment to detect these changes. In addition, we considered changes in metrics that are expected to respond specifically to flow increase. These metrics were related to the habitat requirements of species, the ecological specialisation of communities and the abundance of macroinvertebrate functional groups (seen as surrogates for ecosystem attributes). For invertebrate communities, bioassessment metrics based on richness had equivocal responses to restoration and the Potamon-Type Index demonstrated no or contradictory responses to restoration. The French biotic index was not sensitive to restoration and instead depicted spatial differences in biological quality. For fish communities, the French fish index was marginally sensitive in the reach with the largest minimum flow increase and some of its metrics were sensitive in other reaches. Contrasting with commonly used bioassessment indices and metrics, several metrics related to habitat requirements appropriately indicated the observed changes in community structure. Large flow changes increased the proportion of fish and macroinvertebrate individuals with preferences for midstream habitats, fast currents, deep waters and/or coarse substrates. However, these changes did not translate into the expected increase in ecological specialisation. In addition, functional metrics indicated that restoration led to higher proportions of grazers and higher availability of suspended food for filtering collectors, suggesting a return to the ecological conditions of a large river.

There has been much interest, discussion and controversy about the nature and type of reproductive costs. The manipulation of reproductive effort (e.g. brood size manipulation) may alter not only life-history traits such as future adult survival rate and future reproductive effort, but also behavioural decisions affecting recapture/resighting and dispersal probabilities. We argue that many previous studies of the costs of reproduction may have erroneously concluded the existence or non-existence of such costs because of their use of local return rates to assess survival. In this paper, we take advantage of the modern multistate capture-recapture methods to highlight how the accurate assessment of the costs of reproduction requires incorporating not only recapture probability, but also behavioural 'state' variables, for example dispersal status and cur rent reproductive investment. The inclusion of state-dependent decisions can radically alter the conclusions drawn regarding the costs of reproduction on future survival or reproductive investment. We illustrate this point by re-analysing data collected to address the question of the costs of reproduction in the collared flycatcher and the great tit.

"Dominguez-Garcia, V; Johnson, S; Munoz, MA",2016,Intervality and coherence in complex networks,CHAOS,"Food webs-networks of predators and prey-have long been known to exhibit ""intervality"": species can generally be ordered along a single axis in such a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on unbroken compact intervals. Although the meaning of this axis-usually identified with a ""niche"" dimension-has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the highly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic network modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value by hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the cause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of 46 empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit predator intervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous as the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not exclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites, cellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as interval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web assembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate significant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for food-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental structural traits. We conclude that a new approach to food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem assembly, structure, and function, and propose that certain topological features thought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex networks.

By using biological trait analysis (BTA), we show that on the local scale biogenic changes in sediment accumulation and organic matter content translated into specific shifts in the distribution of functional traits within the community. At a landscape scale, the co-occurrence of multiple ecosystem engineers resulted in the spatial separation of different functional groups, i.e. different functional groups dominated unique complementary habitats.

"Doncaster, CP",2009,Ecological Equivalence: A Realistic Assumption for Niche Theory as a Testable Alternative to Neutral Theory,PLOS ONE,"Background: Hubbell's 2001 neutral theory unifies biodiversity and biogeography by modelling steady-state distributions of species richness and abundances across spatio-temporal scales. Accurate predictions have issued from its core premise that all species have identical vital rates. Yet no ecologist believes that species are identical in reality. Here I explain this paradox in terms of the ecological equivalence that species must achieve at their coexistence equilibrium, defined by zero net fitness for all regardless of intrinsic differences between them. I show that the distinction of realised from intrinsic vital rates is crucial to evaluating community resilience. Principal Findings: An analysis of competitive interactions reveals how zero-sum patterns of abundance emerge for species with contrasting life-history traits as for identical species. I develop a stochastic model to simulate community assembly from a random drift of invasions sustaining the dynamics of recruitment following deaths and extinctions. Species are allocated identical intrinsic vital rates for neutral dynamics, or random intrinsic vital rates and competitive abilities for niche dynamics either on a continuous scale or between dominant-fugitive extremes. Resulting communities have steady-state distributions of the same type for more or less extremely differentiated species as for identical species. All produce negatively skewed log-normal distributions of species abundance, zero-sum relationships of total abundance to area, and Arrhenius relationships of species to area. Intrinsically identical species nevertheless support fewer total individuals, because their densities impact as strongly on each other as on themselves. Truly neutral communities have measurably lower abundance/area and higher species/abundance ratios. Conclusions: Neutral scenarios can be parameterized as null hypotheses for testing competitive release, which is a sure signal of niche dynamics. Ignoring the true strength of interactions between and within species risks a substantial misrepresentation of community resilience to habitat loss.",10.1371/journal.pone.0007460,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

An important prerequisite to tailor conservation action is to understand the drivers and patterns of species-rich communities, and how they change in space and time during a whole season. To account for this, we surveyed wild bees and flowering plants using standardized transects in 11 natural habitat fragments of an IUCN important plant area along the coast of Israel. We used phylogeny- and taxon-based methods of community structure analyses to study the assembly processes of bee communities, and investigated the effects of several landscape parameters on bee diversity using generalized linear models (GLMs). Our results illustrate that natural habitat sites comprised significantly higher species richness compared to disturbed habitat sites, and show that even the smallest habitat fragments harbored unique bee assemblages, with significant species replacement (turnover) found in both space and time. Our GLMs indicated that flower diversity, and semi-natural habitat within 500 m of habitat fragments were important drivers of bee diversity, but we found no evidence for a species-area relationship among sites. Finally, we document a case of phylogenetic overdispersion despite low species richness, which highlights the importance of accounting for phylogenetic diversity rather than only species richness to reach a more fine-grained understanding of pollinator diversity.

However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. ApproachFindingsWe present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species' co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusionsMoving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.",10.1111/geb.12759,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,Didn't actually look at traits just said they're good,

Although it is commonly assumed that disturbance and resource availability constrain separate suites of traits, representing the regenerative and established phases, respectively, a quantification and test of this accepted hypothesis is still lacking due to limitations of traditional statistical techniques. In this paper we quantify, using structural equation modeling (SEM), the relative contributions of disturbance and resource availability to the selection of suites of traits at the community scale. Our model specifies and reflects previously obtained ecological insights, taking disturbance and nutrient availability as central drivers affecting leaf, allometric, seed, and phenology traits in 156 (semi-) natural plant communities throughout The Netherlands. The common hypothesis positing that disturbance and resource availability each affect a set of mutually independent traits was not consistent with the data. Instead, our final model shows that most traits are strongly affected by both drivers. In addition, trait-trait constraints are more important in community assembly than environmental drivers in half of the cases. Both aspects of trait selection are crucial for correctly predicting ecosystem processes and community assembly, and they provide new insights into hitherto underappreciated ecological interactions.",10.1890/10-1961.1,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = seedling relative growth rate, seed mass of th germinule, gemination onset, SLA, leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus conctent, cax canopy height.

For truly predictive community ecology, it is essential to understand the interplay between species traits, their environment and their impacts on the composition of plant communities. These interactions are increasingly understood for various environmental drivers, but our understanding of how traits, in general, change during succession is still modest. We hypothesize that (initial) abiotic conditions other than light drive the successional dynamics of other traits. The idea that different initial abiotic conditions lead to different trait trajectories during succession was predicted long ago but has never been tested for traits. 2. In this study, we compared the successional (decades to centuries) trait trajectories of 19 ecosystem types in low-altitude NW Europe using a database including >4700 plots. We tested which traits (out of a total of 12, including those associated with light competition strategies) show consistent shifts across ecosystems. Additionally, we investigated, through a novel partitioning of trait differences (using partial principal component analyses), whether abiotic factors can explain trait shifts that occur over and above light-induced trait shifts. 3. We show that canopy height, woodiness, leaf size and seed mass increase, and flowering onset and flowering duration decrease consistently with succession across ecosystems, while leaf economic traits and life span showed a mixed response during succession. Accounting for the effect of height revealed that the initial and prevailing abiotic conditions-particularly soil moisture-co-determine trait shifts during succession. Therefore, different initial starting conditions may lead to different trajectories in trait space, most notably due to the differential response of specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content and life span. For example, SLA decreases in seres that become drier over time (initially very wet), while it increases in seres that become wetter over time (initially very dry). 4. Synthesis. Our novel approach of partitioning successional trait shifts between the influence of competition for light and other abiotic factors showed that trajectories of ecosystems through trait space can be explained by a combination of the two: a universal response to changing light availability and a specific response depending on initial abiotic conditions.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01932.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = SLA (mm2 mg−1), LNC (mg g−1), leaf nitrogen per area (g m−2) and leaf size (mm2),  typical maximum canopy height (maxCH; m) and woodiness, seed mass of the germinule, seed mass of the dispersule, germination onset, flowering oncset, and flowering duration ",

Among the available methods, the so-called fourth-corner and RLQ methods are two appealing alternatives that provide a direct way to test and estimate trait-environment relationships. Both methods are based on the analysis of the fourth-corner matrix, which crosses traits and environmental variables weighted by species abundances. However, they differ greatly in their outputs: RLQ is a multivariate technique that provides ordination scores to summarize the joint structure among the three tables, whereas the fourth-corner method mainly tests for individual trait-environment relationships (i.e., one trait and one environmental variable at a time).

We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models.

Predation pressure can facilitate morphological divergence, for example the evolution of both cryptic and conspicuous coloration in animals. In this context Dendrobatid frogs have been used to study evolutionary forces inducing diversity in protective coloration. The polytypic strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) shows strong divergence in aposematic coloration among populations. To investigate whether predation pressure is important for color divergence among populations of O. pumilio we selected four mainland populations and two island populations from Costa Rica and Panama. Spectrometric measurements of body coloration were used to calculate color and brightness contrasts of frogs as an indicator of conspicuousness for the visual systems of several potential predators (avian, crab and snake) and a conspecific observer. Additionally, we conducted experiments using clay model frogs of different coloration to investigate whether the local coloration of frogs is better protected than non-local color morphs, and if predator communities vary among populations. Overall predation risk differed strongly among populations and interestingly was higher on the two island populations. Imprints on clay models indicated that birds are the main predators while attacks of other predators were rare. Furthermore, clay models of local coloration were equally likely to be attacked as those of non-local coloration. Overall conspicuousness (and brightness contrast) of local frogs was positively correlated with attack rates by birds across populations. Together with results from earlier studies we conclude that conspicuousness honestly indicates toxicity to avian predators. The different coloration patterns among populations of strawberry poison frogs in combination with behavior and toxicity might integrate into equally efficient anti-predator strategies depending on local predation and other ecological factors.",10.1371/journal.pone.0130571,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Terrestrial,Other,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,,"Taxonomic = amphibeans (frogs).

To evaluate the structure of coral reef fish communities across Melanesia, we obtained distributional records for 396 reef fish species in five taxa across seven countries. We used hierarchical clustering, nestedness, and multiple linear regression analyses to evaluate the community structure. We also compiled data on life history traits (pelagic larval duration, body size and schooling behavior) to help elucidate the ecological mechanisms behind community structure. Species richness for these taxa along the gradient was significantly related to longitude but not habitat area. Communities are significantly nested, indicating that species-poor communities are largely composed of subsets of the species found on species rich reefs. These trends are robust across taxonomic groups except for the Pomacentridae, which exhibit an anti-nested pattern, perhaps due to a large number of endemic species. Correlations between life history traits and the number of reefs on which species occurred indicate that dispersal and survival ability contribute to determining community structure.

"Drews, A; Strandh, M; Raberg, L; Westerdahl, H",2017,Expression and phylogenetic analyses reveal paralogous lineages of putatively classical and non-classical MHC-I genes in three sparrow species (Passer),BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) plays a central role in immunity and has been given considerable attention by evolutionary ecologists due to its associations with fitness-related traits. Songbirds have unusually high numbers of MHC class I (MHC-I) genes, but it is not known whether all are expressed and equally important for immune function. Classical MHC-I genes are highly expressed, polymorphic and present peptides to T-cells whereas non-classical MHC-I genes have lower expression, are more monomorphic and do not present peptides to T-cells. To get a better understanding of the highly duplicated MHC genes in songbirds, we studied gene expression in a phylogenetic framework in three species of sparrows (house sparrow, tree sparrow and Spanish sparrow), using high-throughput sequencing. We hypothesize that sparrows could have classical and non-classical genes, as previously indicated though never tested using gene expression. Results: The phylogenetic analyses reveal two distinct types of MHC-I alleles among the three sparrow species, one with high and one with low level of polymorphism, thus resembling classical and non-classical genes, respectively. All individuals had both types of alleles, but there was copy number variation both within and among the sparrow species. However, the number of highly polymorphic alleles that were expressed did not vary between species, suggesting that the structural genomic variation is counterbalanced by conserved gene expression. Overall, 50% of the MHC-I alleles were expressed in sparrows. Expression of the highly polymorphic alleles was very variable, whereas the alleles with low polymorphism had uniformly low expression. Interestingly, within an individual only one or two alleles from the polymorphic genes were highly expressed, indicating that only a single copy of these is highly expressed. Conclusions: Taken together, the phylogenetic reconstruction and the analyses of expression suggest that sparrows have both classical and non-classical MHC-I genes, and that the evolutionary origin of these genes predate the split of the three investigated sparrow species 7 million years ago. Because only the classical MHC-I genes are involved in antigen presentation, the function of different MHC-I genes should be considered in future ecological and evolutionary studies of MHC-I in sparrows and other songbirds.",10.1186/s12862-017-0970-7,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Drury, J; Clavel, J; Manceau, M; Morlon, H",2016,Estimating the Effect of Competition on Trait Evolution Using Maximum Likelihood Inference,SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY,"Many classical ecological and evolutionary theoretical frameworks posit that competition between species is an important selective force. For example, in adaptive radiations, resource competition between evolving lineages plays a role in driving phenotypic diversification and exploration of novel ecological space. Nevertheless, current models of trait evolution fit to phylogenies and comparative data sets are not designed to incorporate the effect of competition. The most advanced models in this direction are diversity-dependent models where evolutionary rates depend on lineage diversity. However, these models still treat changes in traits in one branch as independent of the value of traits on other branches, thus ignoring the effect of species similarity on trait evolution. Here, we consider a model where the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in interspecific interactions are influenced by species similarity in trait values and where we can specify which lineages are in sympatry. We develop a maximum likelihood based approach to fit this model to combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the approach accurately estimates the simulated parameter values across a broad range of parameter space. Additionally, we develop tools for specifying the biogeographic context in which trait evolution occurs. In order to compare models, we also apply these biogeographic methods to specify which lineages interact sympatrically for two diversity-dependent models. Finally, we fit these various models to morphological data from a classical adaptive radiation (Greater Antillean Anolis lizards). We show that models that account for competition and geography perform better than other models. The matching competition model is an important new tool for studying the influence of interspecific interactions, in particular competition, on phenotypic evolution. More generally, it constitutes a step toward a better integration of interspecific interactions in many ecological and evolutionary processes.",10.1093/sysbio/syw020,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Focusing mainly on scenarios of competition between closely-related species, we assess the performance of available comparative approaches for analyzing the interplay between interspecific interactions and species phenotypes. We find that many currently used statistical methods often fail to detect the impact of interspecific interactions on trait evolution, that sister-taxa analyses are particularly unreliable in general, and that recently developed process-based models have more satisfactory statistical properties. Methods for detecting predictors of species interactions are generally more reliable than methods for detecting character displacement.

However, the greatest challenge in functional analyses is decomposing the contributions of different ecological and evolutionary processes (e.g., niche-based process, neutral process, and evolutionary process) in determining trait structure. Taking rodents (Rodentia) in the Hengduan Mountains as our study model, we aim to (1) quantify the vertical patterns of functional structure for head-body length (HL), tail/body ratio (TR), animal component in diet (ACD), and all traits; (2) disentangle the relative importance of different assembly processes (environment, space, and phylogeny) in structuring trait dispersion; and (3) assess the feasibility of Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule along elevational gradient. Our results have suggested that the vertical functional structure pattern varied across these three traits, indicating distinct functional roles in the community assembly process. These nonrandom vertical patterns of HL, TR, and terminal ACD have demonstrated these traits were dominated by different ecological process along environmental gradient. In variance partitioning, high proportion of the spatial variations in trait dispersion was explained by environmental and spatial models, which have provided supporting strong evidence for niche-based and neutral processes in leading species coexistence. Although the three traits all exhibited apparent phylogenetic signals, phylogenetic relationship within community failed to predict the spatial variations of functional dispersion, confirming the enormous inference of phylogenetic signals in predicting trait structure. By assessing the vertical patterns of HL and TR at order and family levels, we argued that functional adaptation along an environmental gradient is a surrogate of series of complex processes (e.g., environmental filtering, interspecific interaction, and neutral dispersal) acting on multiple functional axes, which results in inconsistence with the empirical rules along elevational gradient.",10.1002/ece3.3613,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Mammals,Alpine,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = head-body length, tail/body ratio, animal component of the diet, ",

The use of such evasive tactics likely affects the benefits of social learning, yet their effect on social information use has not hitherto been theoretically analysed. I developed a game-theoretical model aimed at exploring both the conditions under which the use of evasive tactics should be favoured and their impact on social information use. Specifically, the model applies to competition among males for access to females: males are not selective in their choice of mates, or they decide to retain or reject potential partners based on either the information obtained by personal sampling or the decisions of others. Furthermore, asocial learners may be of two types: either they respond to the presence of potential rivals by displaying reduced courtship behaviour, thereby reducing the amount of social information but also their own chance of success, or they always display normal behaviour. The model confirms that males may benefit from providing their rivals with reduced information, notably when they may prevent mate-choice copying without compromising their own mating success, and that audience effects may have important evolutionary consequences. Particularly, as the conditions favouring the use of evasive tactics depend on life history and ecological traits, these findings might contribute to explaining inter-specific differences in social information use.",10.1007/s00265-014-1831-7,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

By modelling the changes of different indices describing such patterns - trait means, extremes and diversity in communities - as a function of abiotic gradients, we could understand their drivers and build projections of the impact of global change on the functional components of biodiversity. We used five plant functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content and seed mass) and non-woody vegetation plots to model several indices depicting community-level patterns of functional traits from a set of abiotic environmental variables (topographic, climatic and edaphic) over contrasting environmental conditions in a mountainous landscape. We performed a variation partitioning analysis to assess the relative importance of these variables for predicting patterns of functional traits in communities, and projected the best models under several climate change scenarios to examine future potential changes in vegetation functional properties. Not all indices of trait patterns within communities could be modelled with the same level of accuracy: the models for mean and extreme values of functional traits provided substantially better predictive accuracy than the models calibrated for diversity indices. Topographic and climatic factors were more important predictors of functional trait patterns within communities than edaphic predictors. Overall, model projections forecast an increase in mean vegetation height and in mean specific leaf area following climate warming. This trend was important at mid elevation particularly between 1000 and 2000 m a.s.l.

One possibility is that changes in mosquito microbiomes are impacted by nutrient enrichments and that these changes affect various traits, including larval development, susceptibility to larval control agents, and susceptibility of the adult mosquitoes to pathogens. We tested this hypothesis using field mesocosms supplemented with low-and high-organic-nutrient regimens and then sampled microbial communities associated with the naturally colonizing Culex nigripalpus mosquito vector. By high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we found no significant differences in overall microbial communities associated with sampled mosquitoes, despite detecting discernible differences in environmental variables, including pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient amendments. Nevertheless, indicator species analysis revealed that members of the Clostridiales were significantly associated with mosquitoes that originated from high-nutrient enrichments. In contrast, members of the Burkholderiales were associated with mosquitoes from the low-nutrient enrichment. High bacterial variability associated with the life stages of the C. nigripalpus was largely unaffected by levels of nutrient enrichments that impacted larval microbial resources, including bacteria, ciliates, and flagellates in the larval environments. IMPORTANCE Mosquito microbiota provide important physiological and ecological attributes to mosquitoes, including an impact on their susceptibility to pathogens, fitness, and sensitivity to mosquito control agents. Culex nigripalpus mosquito populations transmit various pathogens, including the Saint Louis and West Nile viruses, and proliferate in nutrient-rich environments, such as in wastewater treatment wet-lands.

Because community assembly theory predicts a low variation in viable traits under conditions of strong ecological filtering, we asked if the diversity in plant traits related to productivity and reproduction would decrease upslope. Location Guaramacal National Park in the Andes of Venezuela (9 degrees 05-21'N, 70 degrees-20'W). Methods We studied altitudinal patterns in the number of trait states of seven categorical traits found among vascular plants (DBH=2.5cm) in 35 0.1-ha plots between 1330 and 2890m. Information on plant traits was obtained from literature and herbaria. To test the altitudinal correlations, we permuted the plot-to-species matrix by randomly selecting species from the entire species pool (conserving the species richness and the speciesabundance pattern in each plot), applying no restrictions and by creating plot-wise null assemblages of species that most likely occurred near a particular plot. In addition, the altitudinal pattern of trait states was examined using fourth-corner analysis. Results Both null model tests yielded similar results. The trait state diversity in fruit size decreased upslope. Plants with small fruits were mostly, but not exclusively, found at higher altitudes, whereas plants with large fruits occurred only at lower elevations. Leaf size showed more states at higher altitudes but this pattern disappeared when rare leaf size classes were down-weighted. The upslope decrease in fruit size might be explained by the relatively low tree height of the upper montane rain forests, the increased selection for large seeds at high temperatures downslope, and the upslope decrease of large-leaved taxa (in view of Corner's rule).

Here, we investigated the trait distribution of periphytic algae in floodplain lakes that are naturally under contrasting environmental pressures with and without flood pulse action (low and high water phases) and the relationship between functional traits and environmental variables at regional and local scales. We hypothesized that functional clustering will be related to the low water phase in local scale, based on environment filters, and functional overdispersion to the high water phase in regional scale. With respect to traits, we can expect that the flood pulse would favored the prevalence of nanoperiphyton, filamentous forms and loosely attached. For this, we conducted a two-year assessment of the structure and dynamic of periphytic algae communities regarding their functional traits in lakes belonging to two sub-basins in a subtropical flood plain (upper Parana River floodplain). The samplings occurred during the high water phase in 2010 and 2011 and the low water phase in 2011. The functional diversity values of the communities were quantified and compared with the mean value of communities randomly generated using null models. The relationships between functional traits and environmental variables were examined using RLQ analysis. We have shown that the traits respond to abiotic factors, and they indicated overdispersion in high water phase, and higher functional diversity in most preserved environments with absence of the pulse. The flood pulse favored the prevalence of colonial life form, stalked, entangled and heterotrichous species. This study showed spatial and temporal differences in the limnological characteristics between the lakes caused by hydrological phase and local forces in different sub-basins and the importance mainly of assimilable nutrients in the evaluation of trait-environment relationships. The overdispersion result can be assigned to flood pulse, which promotes a higher probability of dispersion and colonization of new areas for rare species, disturbance and more heterogeneous habitats, allowing opportunities for resource partitioning and regeneration of different species strategies. Moreover, the higher periphytic algae functional diversity in preserved sites emphasizes the importance of understanding ecological patterns linked to environmental degradation, as well as of conservation initiatives, because variation in periphytic algal communities implies in changes in the trophic structure, dynamics and in the functioning of environments.

These studies have mostly focused on free-living species. Recent research has suggested that inclusion of parasites alters structure. We assess whether such changes in network structure result from unique roles and traits of parasites or from changes to diversity and complexity. We analyzed seven highly resolved food webs that include metazoan parasite data. Our analyses show that adding parasites usually increases link density and connectance (simple measures of complexity), particularly when including concomitant links (links from predators to parasites of their prey). However, we clarify prior claims that parasites ""dominate"" food web links. Although parasites can be involved in a majority of links, in most cases classic predation links outnumber classic parasitism links. Regarding network structure, observed changes in degree distributions, 14 commonly studied metrics, and link probabilities are consistent with scale-dependent changes in structure associated with changes in diversity and complexity. Parasite and free-living species thus have similar effects on these aspects of structure. However, two changes point to unique roles of parasites. First, adding parasites and concomitant links strongly alters the frequency of most motifs of interactions among three taxa, reflecting parasites' roles as resources for predators of their hosts, driven by trophic intimacy with their hosts. Second, compared to free-living consumers, many parasites' feeding niches appear broader and less contiguous, which may reflect complex life cycles and small body sizes. This study provides new insights about generic versus unique impacts of parasites on food web structure, extends the generality of food web theory, gives a more rigorous framework for assessing the impact of any species on trophic organization, identifies limitations of current food web models, and provides direction for future structural and dynamical models.",10.1371/journal.pbio.1001579,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Therefore, we examined whether a simplified plant-functional-type method could overcome such difficulties. A total of 1287 grasslands, spread over eight regions, were characterized according to their environmental and management factors, eight indicator (including Ellenberg) values and abundance of five previously defined grass functional types (GFTs) differing in growth strategies (fast-slow, early-late). Four related plant-community-composition descriptors indicating forage services (forage production, digestibility, distribution of herbage biomass throughout the growing season and management flexibility) responded to environmental and management factors that are correlated to indicator values. Based on GFTs, cluster analysis defined vegetation types (VTs). Their relationships to environmental and management factors (or proxies of them), forage services and species richness were subsequently analysed. Of the thirteen VTs, four consisted mainly of GFTs with a dominant fast-growth strategy and three with a slow-growth strategy. These clusters were clearly related to two stress axes (temperature and nutrients). The other six VTs consisted of a mixture of both strategies and corresponded to intermediate levels of stress and disturbance. Although simplified, the method distinguished VTs that responded consistently to environmental and management factors and provides accurate indicators of forage services.",10.1111/gfs.12129,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = leaf dry matter content, flowering date",

How individual tropical tree species respond to climate change remains relatively unknown. In this study, we refined the species characterization in the CARAIB (CARbon Assimilation In the Biosphere) dynamic vegetation model by replacing plant functional type morpho-physiological traits by species-specific traits. We focus on 12 tropical tree species selected for their importance in both the plant community and human society. We used CARAIB to simulate the current species net primary productivity (NPP), biomass and potential distribution and their changes in the future. Our results indicate that the use of species-specific traits does not necessarily result in an increase of predicted current NPPs. The model projections for the end of the century highlight the large uncertainties in the future of African tropical species. Projected changes in species distribution vary greatly with the general circulation model (GCM) and, to a lesser extent, with the concentration pathway. The question about long-term plant response to increasing CO2 concentrations also leads to contrasting results. In absence of fertilization effect, species are exposed to climate change and might lose 25% of their current distribution under RCP8.5 (12.5% under RCP4.5), considering all the species and climatic scenarios. The vegetation model projects a mean biomass loss of -21.2% under RCP4.5 and -34.5% under RCP8.5. Potential range expansions, unpredictable due to migration limitations, are too limited for offsetting range contraction. By contrast, if the long-term species response to increasing [CO2] is positive, the range reduction is limited to 5%. However, despite a mean biomass increase of 12.2%, a positive CO2 feedback might not prevent tree dieback. Our analysis confirms that species will respond differently to new climatic and atmospheric conditions, which may induce new competition dynamics in the ecosystem and affect ecosystem services.",10.3390/f9110722,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Seasonal Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,1,Global Change Multiple,1,0,1,1,"Traits used = height, root depth, plant functional type, foliage C:N ratio, SLA, ",

Effects of inbreeding depression, direct costs, mating constraints, and polyandry as a threshold trait",EVOLUTION,"Polyandry is often hypothesized to evolve to allow females to adjust the degree to which they inbreed. Multiple factors might affect such evolution, including inbreeding depression, direct costs, constraints on male availability, and the nature of polyandry as a threshold trait. Complex models are required to evaluate when evolution of polyandry to adjust inbreeding is predicted to arise. We used a genetically explicit individual-based model to track the joint evolution of inbreeding strategy and polyandry defined as a polygenic threshold trait. Evolution of polyandry to avoid inbreeding only occurred given strong inbreeding depression, low direct costs, and severe restrictions on initial versus additional male availability. Evolution of polyandry to prefer inbreeding only occurred given zero inbreeding depression and direct costs, and given similarly severe restrictions on male availability. However, due to its threshold nature, phenotypic polyandry was frequently expressed even when strongly selected against and hence maladaptive. Further, the degree to which females adjusted inbreeding through polyandry was typically very small, and often reflected constraints on male availability rather than adaptive reproductive strategy. Evolution of polyandry solely to adjust inbreeding might consequently be highly restricted in nature, and such evolution cannot necessarily be directly inferred from observed magnitudes of inbreeding adjustment.",10.1111/evo.13005,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

By employing this approach with 15 amphibian species in the western USA, we make unexpected predictions. First, inter-decadal variability in climate change can prevent range shifts by causing gaps in climate paths, even in the absence of geographic barriers. Second, the hitherto unappreciated trait of persistence during unfavourable climatic conditions is critical to species range shifts. Third, climatic fluctuations and low persistence could lead to endangerment even if the future potential range size is large.

Novel ecological stressors may limit adaptive evolution of naive lineages that have experienced historically different selective regimes. Regarded as recently derived from a pond-breeding ancestor, streamside salamanders face the novel and strong selection pressure of breeding in streams with fish predators. A statistical phylogenetic approach was used to test whether adaptive evolution of antipredator performance phenotypes in streamside salamanders was positively associated with: (1) estimated per-lineage duration of coexistence with predatory fish; and (2) consistency of this predator selective-regime within lineages. Average durations of fish contact were computed for each salamander lineage on a set of chronograms. Selection consistency was determined by estimating the number of ecological transitions between fish and fishless states using stochastic character mapping. Historical selection in streamside salamanders can be generally characterized as unstable, apparently punctuated by the stochastic loss and recolonization of predatory fish in most lineages. We found that the efficacy of antipredator phenotypes in salamanders is strongly related to historical duration, as well as consistency, of selection imposed by predatory fish.",10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00741.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Historically, arthropod driven functions, such as herbivory and pest-control, have been thought to be influenced by direct and indirect associations among species. Although a number of studies have evaluated how plant diversity affects arthropod communities and arthropod-mediated ecosystem processes, it remains unclear whether diversity effects on arthropods are sufficiently consistent over time such that observed responses can be adequately predicted by classical hypotheses based on associational effects. By combining existing results from a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) with new analyses, we evaluate the consistency of consumer responses within and across taxonomic, trophic, and trait-based (i.e. vertical stratification) groupings, and we consider which changes in arthropod community composition are associated with changes in consumer-mediated ecosystem functions.Overall, higher plant species richness supported more diverse and complex arthropod communities and this pattern was consistent across multiple years. Vegetation-associated arthropods responded more strongly to changes in plant species richness than ground-dwelling arthropods. Additionally, increases in plant species richness were associated with shifts in the species-abundance distributions for many, but not all taxa. For example, highly specialized consumers showed a decrease in dominance and an increase in the number of rare species with increasing plant species richness. Most ecosystem processes investigated responded to increases in plant species richness in the same way as the trophic group mediating the process, e.g. both herbivory and herbivore diversity increase with increasing plant species richness. In the Jena Experiment and other studies, inconsistencies between predictions based on classic hypotheses of associational effects and observed relationships between plant species richness and arthropod diversity likely reflect the influence of multi-trophic community dynamics and species functional trait distributions. Future research should focus on testing a broader array of mechanisms to unravel the biological processes underlying the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.

However, while the association between climate and the structure and diversity of vegetation has a long history, scientists have only recently begun to develop a more synthetic understanding of biomes based on the evolution of plant diversity, function, and community assembly. At the broadest scales, climate filters species based on their functional attributes, and the resulting functional differences in dominant vegetation among biomes are important to modeling the global carbon cycle and the functioning of the Earth system. Nevertheless, across biomes, plant species have been shown to occupy a common set of global functional ""spectra"", reflecting variation in overall plant size, leaf economics, and hydraulics. Still, comprehensive measures of functional diversity and assessments of functional similarity have not been compared across biomes at continental to global scales. Here, we examine distributions of functional diversity of plant species across the biomes of North and South America, based on distributional information for > 80,000 vascular plant species and functional trait data for ca. 8,000 of those species. First, we show that despite progress in data integration and synthesis, significant knowledge shortfalls persist that limit our ability to quantify the functional biodiversity of biomes. Second, our analyses of the available data show that all the biomes in North and South America share a common pattern-most geographically common, widespread species in any biome tend to be functionally similar whereas the most functionally distinctive species are restricted in their distribution. Third, when only the widespread and functionally similar species in each biome are considered, biomes can be more readily distinguished functionally, and patterns of dissimilarity between biomes appear to reflect a correspondence between climate and functional niche space. Taken together, our results suggest that while the study of the functional diversity of biomes is still in its formative stages, further development of the field will yield insights linking evolution, biogeography, community assembly, and ecosystem function.

Sensitivity analyses revealed that upon exposure to thermal stress, thermal tolerance, growth rate, and longevity were the most important predictors of coral persistence.

Small forest patches of agricultural landscapes provide many ecosystem services and also the disservice of LB risk. Biotic interactions and environmental filtering shape tick host communities distinctively between specific regions of Europe, which makes evaluating the dilution effect hypothesis and its influence across various scales challenging. Latitude, macroclimate, landscape and habitat properties drive both hosts and ticks and are comparable metrics across Europe. Therefore, we instead assess these environmental drivers as indicators and determine their respective roles for the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus. Methods: We sampled I. ricinus and measured environmental properties of macroclimate, landscape and habitat quality of forest patches in agricultural landscapes along a European macroclimatic gradient. We used linear mixed models to determine significant drivers and their relative importance for nymphal and adult B. burgdorferi prevalence. We suggest a new prevalence index, which is pool-size independent. Results: During summer months, our prevalence index varied between 0 and 0.4 per forest patch, indicating a low to moderate disservice. Habitat properties exerted a fourfold larger influence on B. burgdorferi prevalence than macroclimate and landscape properties combined. Increasingly available ecotone habitat of focal forest patches diluted and edge density at landscape scale amplified B. burgdorferi prevalence. Indicators of habitat attractiveness for tick hosts (food resources and shelter) were the most important predictors within habitat patches. More diverse and abundant macro and microhabitat had a diluting effect, as it presumably diversifies the niches for tick-hosts and decreases the probability of contact between ticks and their hosts and hence the transmission likelihood. Conclusions: Diluting effects of more diverse habitat patches would pose another reason to maintain or restore high biodiversity in forest patches of rural landscapes. We suggest classifying habitat patches by their regulating services as dilution and amplification habitat, which predominantly either decrease or increase B. burgdorferi prevalence at local and landscape scale and hence LB risk. Particular emphasis on promoting LB-diluting properties should be put on the management of those habitats that are frequently used by humans. In the light of these findings, climate change may be of little concern for LB risk at local scales, but this should be evaluated further.",10.1186/s13071-017-2590-x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,Looked at only plant traits not Tick traits,

The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-III take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package IV meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-III and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground-belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.",10.3897/rio.5.e34564,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gut content analysis, thereby deriving a new perspective on community interactions and their responses to environment. For this, we use an elevational gradient in the High Arctic, asking how the environment and species traits interact in shaping predator-prey interactions involving the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis. To characterize the community of potential prey available to this predator, we used pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. To characterize the prey actually consumed, we applied molecular gut content analysis. Using joint species distribution models, we found elevation and vegetation mass to explain the most variance in the composition of the prey community locally available. However, such environmental variables had only a small effect on the prey community found in the spider's gut. These observations indicate that Pardosa exerts selective feeding on particular taxa irrespective of environmental constraints. By directly modelling the probability of predation based on gut content data, we found that neither trait matching in terms of predator and prey body size nor phylogenetic or environmental constraints modified interaction probability. Our results indicate that taxonomic identity may be more important for predator-prey interactions than environmental constraints or prey traits. The impact of environmental change on predator-prey interactions thus appears to be indirect and mediated by its imprint on the community of available prey.",10.1111/mec.14872,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Insects,Alpine,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = body mass, feeding mode.

Measuring the functional response, i.e. the intake rate of a consumer as a function of prey density, is a powerful method to predict the strength of trophic links and assess motives of prey choice, particularly in arthropod communities. However, due to their reductionist set-up, functional responses, which are based on laboratory feeding experiments, may not display field conditions, possibly leading to skewed results. Here, we tested the validity of functional responses of centipede predators and their prey by comparing them with empirical gut content data from field-collected predators. Our predator-prey system included lithobiid and geophilomorph centipedes, abundant and widespread predators of forest soils and their soil-dwelling prey. First, we calculated the body size-dependent functional responses of centipedes using a published functional response model in which we included natural prey abundances and animal body masses. This allowed us to calculate relative proportions of specific prey taxa in the centipede diet. In a second step, we screened field-collected centipedes for DNA of eight abundant soil-living prey taxa and estimated their body size-dependent proportion of feeding events. We subsequently compared empirical data for each of the eight prey taxa, on proportional feeding events with functional response-derived data on prey proportions expected in the gut, showing that both approaches significantly correlate in five out of eight predator-prey links for lithobiid centipedes but only in one case for geophilomorph centipedes. Our findings suggest that purely allometric functional response models, which are based on predator-prey body size ratios are too simple to explain predator-prey interactions in a complex system such as soil. We therefore stress that specific prey traits, such as defence mechanisms, must be considered for accurate predictions.",10.1111/oik.04885,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,Traits = body size.

"Eklof, A; Helmus, MR; Moore, M; Allesina, S",2012,Relevance of evolutionary history for food web structure,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Explaining the structure of ecosystems is one of the great challenges of ecology. Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analysing whether evolutionary history-represented by taxonomic classification-provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxonomic ranks (kingdom to class).

We predicted that climate warming and CO 2-enrichment should strengthen trophic cascades by reducing the relative efficiency of predation-resistant herbivores, if herbivore consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. This weakens the insurance effect of herbivore diversity. We tested this prediction using experimental ocean warming and acidification in seagrass mesocosms. Meta-analyses of published experiments first indicated that consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. The experiment then showed that three common herbivores together controlled macroalgae and facilitated seagrass dominance, regardless of climate change. When the predation-vulnerable herbivore was excluded in normal conditions, the two resistant herbivores maintained top-down control. Under warming, however, increased algal growth outstripped control by herbivores and the system became algal-dominated. Consequently, climate change can reduce the relative efficiency of resistant herbivores and weaken the insurance effect of biodiversity.",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01810.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Eklof, JS; Havenhand, JN; Alsterberg, C; Gamfeldt, L",2015,Community-level effects of rapid experimental warming and consumer loss outweigh effects of rapid ocean acidification,OIKOS,"Climate change and consumer loss simultaneously affect marine ecosystems, but we have limited understanding of the relative importance of these factors and the interactions between them. Moreover, effects of environmental change are mediated by organism traits or life histories, which determine their sensitivity. Yet, trait-based analyses have rarely been used to understand the effects of climate change, especially in the marine environment. Here we used a five-week mesocosm experiment to assess the single and interactive effects of 1) rapid ocean warming, 2) rapid ocean acidification, and 3) simulated consumer loss, on the diversity and composition of macrofauna communities in eelgrass Zostera marina beds. Experimental warming (ambient versus + 3.2 degrees C) and loss of a key consumer (the omnivorous crustacean, Gammarus locusta) both increased macrofauna richness and abundance, and altered overall species trait distributions and life history composition. Warming and consumer-loss favored poorly defended epifaunal crustaceans (tube-building amphipods), and species that brood their off spring. We suggest these organisms were favored because warming and consumer-loss caused increased metabolism, food supply and, potentially, settling substrate, and lowered predation pressure from the omnivorous G. locusta. Importantly, we found no single, or interactive, effects of the rapid ocean acidification (ambient versus -0.35 pH units). We suggest this result reflects natural variability in the native habitat and, potentially, the short duration of the experiment: organisms in these communities routinely experience rapid diurnal pH fluctuations that exceed the mean ocean acidification predicted for the coming century (and used in our experiments). In summary, our study indicates that macrofauna in shallow vegetated ecosystems will be significantly more affected by rapid warming and consumer diversity loss than by rapid ocean acidification.",10.1111/oik.01544,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Marine,Multiple,Eelgrass,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life Histoy, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,1,T,1,Global Change Multiple,0,0,1,1,"Traits = There's a ton, in the SI.

It has been widely recognized that species show extensive variation in form and function. Based on species' attributes, they can be positioned along major axes of variation, which are often defined by life-history traits, such as number of offspring, age at maturity or generation time. Less emphasis has been given in this respect to tolerance traits, especially to resistance to abiotic stress conditions, which often determine community (dis)assembly and distribution. 2. Soil fauna species distribution is governed to a large extent by environmental conditions that filter communities according to functional traits, such as abiotic stress tolerance, morphology and body size. Trait-based approaches have been successfully used to predict soil biota responses to abiotic stress. It remains unclear, though, how these traits relate to life-history traits that determine individual performance, that is, reproduction and survival. 3. Here, we analyse patterns in multidimensional trait distribution of dominant groups of soil fauna, that is, Isopoda, Gastropoda and Collembola, known to be important to the functioning of ecosystems. We compiled trait information from existing literature, trait databases and supplementary measurements. We looked for common patterns in major axes of trait variation and tested if vertical distribution of species in the soil explained trait variation based on three components of trait diversity (trait richness, evenness and divergence). 4. Our results showed that two to three axes of variation structured the trait space of life-history and tolerance traits in each of the taxonomic groups and that vertical distribution in soil explained the main axis of trait variation. We also found evidence of environmental filtering on soil fauna along the vertical soil distribution, with lower trait richness and trait divergence in soil-dwelling than in surface-living species. 5. Our study was partially limited by the lack of detailed trait measurements for the selected taxonomic groups. In this regard, there is an urgent need for standardized trait databases across invertebrate groups to improve trait-based diversity analysis and fill gaps in the mechanistic understanding behind trait distribution, trait filtering and the link with species fitness and performance.",10.1111/1365-2656.12838,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Multiple,Soil,1,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = (isopoda = max body size, drought resistance, inundation resistance, walking speed, vertical stratification, cluthc size), (Shelled gastropoda = maximal shell size, survival of dry period, inundation tolerance, age at maturity, longevity, clutch size, verticfal stratification), (Collembrola = temperature preference, max body size thermal breadth, moisture preference, mode of reproduction).

Northern Britain (Scotland). Indicator-species analysis was used to pre-select lichen epiphytes along parallel gradients in climate and the extent of old-growth woodland. Nonparametric multiplicative regression was used to describe in a predictive model the individualistic response of selected species, which were projected based on climate-change scenarios and contrasting patterns of simulated woodland loss or gain. Species with a similar response were grouped using a novel application of cluster analysis to summarize the potentially huge number of projected outcomes. Projected patterns of occurrence under climate-change scenarios were examined for different levels of old-growth woodland extent. Forty-two lichen species were statistically significant indicator species in oceanic woodlands, and old-growth indicators under suboptimal climatic conditions. Responses to climate-change scenarios were contrasting, with one group comprising species projected to increase in extent in response to climate warming, and other response groups projected to decrease in occurrence, possibly in response to shifting rainfall patterns. The occurrence of all response groups had a positive relationship with old-growth woodland extent. An 'oceanic' biogeographical group of epiphytes identified using the baseline climatic and present-day woodland setting comprised species with a cyanobacterial photobiont or tropical phytogeographical affinities. However, within this group the individual species responses to climate-change scenarios were contrasting. Additionally, group responses may be poorly matched with simple ecological traits. However, the studied interaction between climate and habitat continuity suggests that the impact of climate change might be offset for certain lichen epiphytes by appropriate management of woodland resources, for example, expansion of native woodland around remnant old-growth stands.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01989.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Separating deterministic from stochastic processes is possible, but finding statistical evidence for specific biological interactions is challenging. We attempt to solve this problem for ant communities nesting in epiphytic bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus) in Borneo's lowland rainforest. By recording the frequencies with which each and every single ant species occurred together, we were able to test statistically for patterns associated with inter specific competition. We found evidence for competition, but the resulting co-occurrence pattern was the opposite of what we expected. Rather than detecting species segregation the classical hallmark of competition we found species aggregation. Moreover, our approach of testing individual pairwise interactions mostly revealed spatially positive rather than negative associations. Significant negative interactions were only detected among large ants, and among species of the subfamily Ponerinae. Remarkably, the results from this study, and from a corroborating analysis of ant communities known to be structured by competition, suggest that competition within the ants leads to species aggregation rather than segregation. We believe this unexpected result is linked with the displacement of species following asymmetric competition. We conclude that analysing co-occurrence frequencies across complete species assemblages, separately for each species, and for each unique pairwise combination of species, represents a subtle yet powerful way of detecting structure and compartmentalisation in ecological communities.

Multifaceted approaches of range determinants are, however, still rare, despite the widespread recognition that correlative modelling approaches alone are not sufficient to understand and predict species' distributions. Here, we combined genetic, distributional and physiological data to reveal the processes that cause the disjunct distribution of the groundwater isopod Proasellus valdensis in isolated Alpine mountains previously covered by Pleistocene glaciers. LocationThe Alps and Jura Mountains, France. MethodsPhylogenetic/phylogeographical methods based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes were used to test for recent dispersal between mountains. A logistic regression on presence-absence data was performed to quantify variation in the probability of occurrence with temperature. Variation in survival and respiration over a range of temperatures was measured within four populations to test for a causal effect of temperature on species distribution. ResultsDespite the disjunct distribution, genetic analyses supported recent dispersal between mountains, as indicated by weak divergence among sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), a single haplotype network showing no spatial structuring, and a small proportion of molecular variance distributed between mountains. The probability of occurrence of P.valdensis decreased significantly with increasing temperature, although physiological experiments indicated that occurrence in warmer habitats was probably restricted by thermally dependent biotic interactions rather than by temperature itself. All populations maintained a high survival rate over a wide range of temperatures (3-15 degrees C), with a weak but detectable tendency for local adaptation. Main conclusionsCombining phylogeographical, physiological and habitat modelling methods reveals the interacting processes that drive range dynamics. A broad thermal tolerance helps P.valdensis to colonize vacant habitats during the onset of glacial melting, but range fragmentation and local adaptation, leading to thermal niche narrowing, proceed during warmer interglacials as biotic interactions progressively intensify.",10.1111/jbi.12237,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

To evaluate this issue for a local catchment case study, we explored metrics and spatial patterns of service supply for water quality regulation, agriculture production, carbon storage, and biodiversity for the Macronutrient Conwy catchment. Methods included using ecosystem models such as LUCI and JULES, integration of national scale field survey datasets, earth observation products and plant trait databases, to produce finely resolved maps of species richness and primary production. Analyses were done with both 1 x 1 km gridded and subcatchment data. A common single gradient characterised catchment scale ecosystem services supply with agricultural production and carbon storage at opposing ends of the gradient as reported for a national-scale assessment. Species diversity was positively related to production due to the below national average productivity levels in the Conwy combined with the unimodal relationship between biodiversity and productivity at the national scale. In contrast to the national scale assessment, a strong reduction in water quality as production increased was observed in these low productive systems. Various soil variables were tested for their predictive power of ecosystem service supply. Soil carbon, nitrogen, their ratio and soil pH all had double the power of rainfall and altitude, each explaining around 45% of variation but soil pH is proposed as a potential metric for ecosystem service supply potential as it is a simple and practical metric which can be carried out in the field with crowd-sourcing technologies now available. The study emphasises the importance of considering multiple ecosystem services together due to the complexity of covariation at local and national scales, and the benefits of exploiting a wide range of metrics for each service to enhance data robustness.

Species-rich grasslands are highly endangered habitats in Central Europe. To halt their ongoing loss, many sites have become subjects of restoration efforts. Traditionally, restoration success is measured using target species or by comparing similarity in species composition. Here, we suggest to additionally use functional community composition to assess restoration success as functional traits might offer mechanistic insights into restoration processes. 2. In a 5-year restoration experiment, we annually evaluated the responses of (i) floristic composition and species diversity, (ii) number and cover of target species, (iii) functional identity and (iv) functional diversity to four different methods of assisted recolonization through species introduction: hay transfer and application of threshing material from a local provenance, combined with and without addition of regional seed mixtures of target species, as well as to a control treatment. 3. Across all treatments, floristic composition, species diversity, and number and cover of target species approached the values of reference sites. In the last observation year, Shannon diversity was still lower in all treatment plots than in the reference plots, while the number of target forb species had reached or exceeded the reference levels. We demonstrated that the community was also restored functionally in many aspects, but not in all studied traits. Calculated community-weighted means (CWMs), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in experimental plots did not differ significantly from the reference plots, thereby indicating that productivity of restored sites had reached target values. In contrast, CWMs of strategy types and pollination modes revealed significant differences, showing that biotic interactions among plant species and with other trophic levels have not yet been fully restored. However, almost all CWMs showed a trajectory towards the reference, thus giving a positive prospect for the future development. With respect to functional diversity (FD), we found steadily increasing FD values for almost all traits analysed. 4. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated that all applied restoration measures were appropriate to achieve the restoration aim in terms of species composition of a given community and the establishment of target species. With respect to many functional traits, the restored meadows were already as functional as communities from the reference sites. Hence, including functional criteria did not only corroborate traditional criteria of restoration success but also allowed identifying those floodplain meadow's functions that can be quickly and less quickly restored.",10.1111/1365-2664.12623,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = ecological strategy, plant height, SLA, Leaf dry matter content, seed mass, seed bank lengevity, lifespan, flower duration, pollination mode",

However, some plant species could become more easily established than others. The establishment success of 37 species was analyzed over 6years at two study sites of a restoration project in Germany where hay transfer and sowing of threshing material in combination with additional sowing were applied. The effects of the restoration method applied, time since the restoration took place, traits related to germination, dispersal, and reproduction, and combinations of these traits on the establishment were analyzed. While the specific restoration method of how seeds were transferred played a subordinate role, the establishment success depended in particular on traits such as flower season or the lifeform. Species flowering in autumn, such as Pastinaca sativa and Serratula tinctoria, became established better than species flowering in other seasons, probably because they could complete their life cycle, resulting in increasingly stronger seed pressure with time. Geophytes, like Allium angulosum and Galium boreale, became established very poorly, but showed an increase with study duration. For various traits, we found significant trait by method and trait by year interactions, indicating that different traits promoted establishment under different conditions. Using a multi-model approach, we tested whether traits acted in combination. For the first years and the last year, we found that models with three traits explained establishment success better than models with a single trait or two traits. While traits had only an additive effect on the establishment success in the first years, trait interactions became important thereafter. The most important trait was the season of flowering, which occurred in all best models from the third year onwards.

Understanding phylogenetic relationships among species in a community has become an important component of assessing assembly processes. However, the application of evolutionary information to questions in community ecology has been limited in large part by the lack of accurate estimates of phylogenetic relationships among individual species found within communities, and is particularly limiting in comparisons between communities. Therefore, streamlining and maximizing the information content of these community phylogenies is a priority. To test the viability and advantage of a multi-community phylogeny, we constructed a multi-plot mega-phylogeny of 1347 species of trees across 15 forest dynamics plots in the ForestGEO network using DNA barcode sequence data (rbcL, matK, and psbA-tmH) and compared community phylogenies for each individual plot with respect to support for topology and branch lengths, which affect evolutionary inference of community processes. The levels of taxonomic differentiation across the phylogeny were examined by quantifying the frequency of resolved nodes throughout. In addition, three phylogenetic distance (PD) metrics that are commonly used to infer assembly processes were estimated for each plot [PD, Mean Phylogenetic Distance (MPD), and Mean Nearest Taxon Distance (MNTD)]. Lastly, we examine the partitioning of phylogenetic diversity among community plots through quantification of inter-community MPD and MNTD. Overall, evolutionary relationships were highly resolved across the DNA barcode-based mega-phylogeny, and phylogenetic resolution for each community plot was improved when estimated within the context of the mega-phylogeny. Likewise, when compared with phylogenies for individual plots, estimates of phylogenetic diversity in the mega-phylogeny were more consistent, thereby removing a potential source of biasat the plot-level, and demonstrating the value of assessing phylogenetic relationships simultaneously within a mega-phylogeny. An unexpected result of the comparisons among plots based on the mega-phylogeny was that the communities in the ForestGEO plots in general appear to be assemblages of more closely related species than expected by chance, and that differentiation among communities is very low, suggesting deep floristic connections among communities and new avenues for future analyses in community ecology.",10.3389/fgene.2014.00358,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Methods We compared large anuran amphibian data sets at both the regional and cross-continental scale. We applied a combination of three-table ordinations (RLQ) and permutation model-based multivariate fourth-corner statistics to test for traithabitat relationships at both scales and used phylogenetic comparative methods to quantify phylogenetic signal in traits that enter these analyses. Results Despite the existence of significant traithabitat links and congruent trait patterns, we did not find evidence for the existence of a universal traithabitat relationship at the assemblage level and no clear sign for cross-continental convergence of traithabitat relations. Patterns rather varied between continents. Despite the fact that a number of traits were conserved across phylogenies, the phylogenetic signal varied between regions.

Characterisation of biodiversity is typically based on taxonomic approaches, while much less is known about other related aspects. Functional trait diversity is one such component of biodiversity that has not been addressed rigorously in ecological research until recently. We tested the congruence between taxonomic- and trait-based approaches, and examined how spatial configuration, local abiotic environmental factors and biotic effects interact to influence taxonomic- and trait-based characterisation of freshwater fish assemblages. 2. Fish assemblage data were compiled for 124 lakes in southern Finland. Variance partitioning in both linear regression analyses and redundancy analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and environmental variables to taxonomic and functional trait diversity and structure. Additionally, a null model analysis was used to test for the potential effects of interspecific segregation and biotic interactions on the co-occurrence of species. 3. The species pool was relatively poor. However, trait-based classification of species indicated that most species belonged to unique functional entities, which suggested low redundancy in species composition. Correlation analysis indicated a very strong relationship between species richness (SR) and the number of unique trait combinations (UTC). Ecoregion-level heterogeneity in SR and UTC were well represented in a relatively small group of randomly selected lakes (c. 30 lakes). Multiple regressions indicated moderate roles for abiotic environmental variables (i.e. lake surface area, depth, total phosphorous, colour and pH) in determining SR, UTC and the distribution of single trait categories, whereas geographical location was not generally influential. 4. Redundancy analysis revealed similar patterns to those of diversity analyses for taxonomic and associated trait-based structure, emphasising the effect of abiotic environmental variables and the negligible effect of geographical position. 5. Co-occurrence analysis indicated significant checkerboard distribution at the whole assemblage level, but interspecific segregation proved to be of relatively minor importance in the constrained analyses, where species pair combinations within trait category groups were evaluated. 6. Our results suggest that taxonomic- and trait-based patterns of boreal lake fish assemblages are strongly interrelated. Environmental filtering through the effects of local abiotic variables seems to have the most prominent role in determining trait-based assemblage patterns among lakes, which may also be secondarily shaped by biotic interactions. 7. From the applied perspective, it may not necessarily matter whether traditional taxonomic or more novel trait-based approaches are used in characterising spatial patterns in boreal fish assemblages. However, trait-based approaches may provide complementary information which cannot be directly revealed by taxonomic data.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02220.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Fish,Lake,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,0,1,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Tratis = life history strategy, spawning habitat preference, spawning period, vertical habitat use, trophic structure placement",

Many species are aphidophagous, feeding as larvae and adults on aphids, but some species also feed on other hemipterous insects (i.e., heteropterans, psyllids, whiteflies), beetle and moth larvae, pollen, fungal spores, and even plant tissue. Several species are biological control agents or widespread invasive species (e.g., Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)). Despite the ecological importance of this tribe, relatively little is known about the phylogenetic relationships within it. The generic concepts within the tribe Coccinellini are unstable and do not reflect a natural classification, being largely based on regional revisions. This impedes the phylogenetic study of important traits of Coccinellidae at a global scale (e.g. the evolution of food preferences and biogeography). Results: We present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coccinellini to date, based on three nuclear and one mitochondrial gene sequences of 38 taxa, which represent all major Coccinellini lineages. The phylogenetic reconstruction supports the monophyly of Coccinellini and its sister group relationship to Chilocorini. Within Coccinellini, three major clades were recovered that do not correspond to any previously recognised divisions, questioning the traditional differentiation between Halyziini, Discotomini, Tytthaspidini, and Singhikaliini. Ancestral state reconstructions of food preferences and morphological characters support the idea of aphidophagy being the ancestral state in Coccinellini. This indicates a transition from putative obligate scale feeders, as seen in the closely related Chilocorini, to more agile general predators. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the classification of Coccinellini has been misled by convergence in morphological traits. The evolutionary history of Coccinellini has been very dynamic in respect to changes in host preferences, involving multiple independent host switches from different insect orders to fungal spores and plants tissues. General predation on ephemeral aphids might have created an opportunity to easily adapt to mixed or specialised diets (e.g. obligate mycophagy, herbivory, predation on various hemipteroids or larvae of leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae)). The generally long-lived adults of Coccinellini can consume pollen and floral nectars, thereby surviving periods of low prey frequency. This capacity might have played a central role in the diversification history of Coccinellini.",10.1186/s12862-017-1002-3,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Species ranges are partially limited by their tolerances to extrinsic environmental conditions such as climate and habitat. However, they are also determined by the capacity of species to disperse, establish new populations and proliferate, which are in turn dependent on species intrinsic life-history traits. So far, the contribution of intrinsic factors driving species distributions has been inconclusive, largely because intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been examined simultaneously in a satisfactory way. We investigate how geographical ranges of plants are determined by both extrinsic environmental factors and species intrinsic life-history traits. LocationEurope. MethodsWe compiled a database on plant geographical ranges, environmental tolerances and life-history traits that constitutes the largest dataset analysed to date (1276 species). We used generalized linear modelling to test if range size and range filling (the proportion of climatically suitable area a species occupies) are affected by dispersal distance, habitat breadth and 10 life-history traits related to establishment and proliferation. ResultsThe species characteristics that were most linked to range limitations of European plant species were dispersal potential, seed bank persistence and habitat breadth (which together explained 30% of deviance in range filling and range size). Specific leaf area, which has been linked to establishment ability, made a smaller contribution to native range limitations. Main conclusionsOur results can be used to improve estimates of extinction vulnerability under climate change. Species with high dispersal capacity, that can maintain viable seed banks for several years and that can live in an intermediate number of habitats have the fewest non-climatic limitations on their ranges, and are most likely to shift their geographical ranges under climate change. We suggest that climate-change risk assessments should not focus exclusively on dispersal capacity.",10.1111/geb.12306,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,1,"Traits = dispersal distance, habitat breadth, seed bank persistence, capacity to self-fertilize, flower pollinator, age of first flowering, reproductive frequency, resprouting after fire, vegetative regeneration, SLA, Seed mass, plant height",
"Estrada, A; Morales-Castilla, I; Meireles, C; Caplat, P; Early, R",2018,Equipped to cope with climate change: traits associated with range filling across European taxa,ECOGRAPHY,"In order to understand the ecological effects of climate change it is essential to forecast suitable areas for species in the future. However, species' ability to reach potentially suitable areas is also critical for species survival. These range-shift' abilities can be studied using life-history traits related to four range-shift stages: emigration, movement, establishment, and proliferation. Here, we use the extent to which species' ranges fill the climatically suitable area available (range filling') as a proxy for the ability of European mammals and birds to shift their ranges under climate change. We detect which traits associate most closely with range filling. Drawing comparisons with a recent analysis for plants, we ask whether the latitudinal position of species' ranges supports the assertion that post-glacial range-shift limitations cause disequilibrium between ranges and climate. We also disentangle which of the three taxonomic groups has greatest range filling. For mammals, generalists and early-reproducing species have the greatest range filling. For birds, generalist species with high annual fecundity, which live longer than expected based on body size, have the greatest range filling. Although we consider traits related to the four range-shift stages, only traits related to establishment and proliferation ability significantly influence range filling of mammals and birds. Species with the greatest range filling are those whose range centroid falls in the latitudinal centre of Europe, suggesting that post-glacial range expansion is a leading cause of disequilibrium with climate, although other explanations are also possible. Range filling of plants is lower than that of mammals or birds, suggesting that plants are more range-limited by non-climatic factors. Therefore, plants might be face greater non-climatic restraints on range shifts than mammals or birds.",10.1111/ecog.02968,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Multiple,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = mammals & birds.

"Etting, SF; Isbell, LA; Grote, MN",2014,Factors Increasing Snake Detection and Perceived Threat in Captive Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta),AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,"The primary predators of primates are all ambush hunters, and yet felids, raptors, and snakes differ in aspects of their ecology that affect the evasive strategies of their primate prey. Felids and raptors can traverse long distances quickly, thus the urgency of threat they present increases as they come closer in proximity to primates. In contrast, snakes do not move rapidly over long distances, and so primates may be reasonably safe even at close distances provided snakes can be detected and monitored. We investigated the ability of captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to detect snakes at distances ranging from 15 to 1.5m. We also examined variation in intensity of perceived threat by applying a Hidden Markov Model to infer changes in underlying state from observable behaviors, that is, increased attention and mobbing. We found that the macaques often failed to detect snake models but that closer proximity improved snake detection, which is necessary before threat can be perceived. We also found that having only one individual in fairly close proximity (7.5m) was sufficient to alert the rest of the group and so the chances of detection did not increase with increasing group size. Finally, we found that when the snakes were perceived, they did not elicit greater intensity of response with closer proximity. These results provide evidence that the threat from snakes is greatest when they are in proximity to primates but are unseen. When snakes are seen, however, distance appears not to affect primates' perceived risk, in contrast to their perceived risk from raptors and felids. Am. J. Primatol. 76:135-145, 2014.

While numerous mechanisms that may drive such total species-energy relationships have been identified, knowledge of their relative contributions is scant. Here, we adopt a novel approach to identify these drivers that exploits the composite nature of species richness, i.e. its summation from individual species distributions. We construct individual species-energy relationships (ISERs) for each species in the British breeding avifauna using both solar (temperature) and productive energy metrics (normalized difference vegetation index) as measures of environmental energy availability. We use the slopes of these relationships and the resultant change in deviance, relative to a null model, as measures of their strength and use them as response variables in multiple regressions that use ecological traits as predictors. The commonest species exhibit the strongest ISERs, which is counter to the prediction derived from the more individuals hypothesis. There is no evidence that predatory species have stronger ISERs, which is incompatible with the suggestion that high levels of energy availability increase the length of the food chain allowing larger numbers of predators to exist. We find some evidence that species with narrow niche breadths have stronger ISERs, thus providing one of the few pieces of supportive evidence that high-energy availability promotes species richness by increasing the occurrence of specialist species that use a narrow range of resources.",10.1098/rspb.2006.3487,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

These birds are endemic to the high-altitude zones of East African mountains. They are bright iridescent green with elongated central tail feathers and red pectoral tufts. The elongated tail is believed to be a mate choice cue, and the red tufts play a role in aggressive encounters between males. As adults, they feed almost exclusively on the nectar of Lobelia telekii flowers, which males defend from conspecifics. The long term survival of individually identifiable males colour-marked in 1989 and 1990 was investigated. Territorial adult males had an average annual survival rate of 72%, which is at the top of the range reported for tropical birds. The effects of morphology and territory characteristics on male survival were examined by adding covariates to the survival model. This analysis showed that male N. johnstoni with longer tails had a higher probability of survival than did short-tailed males. There was no apparent relation between tuft size or the number of L. telekii inflorescences on the territory and survival. The results presented here suggest that long-tailed males may be of intrinsically higher quality than are shorter tailed males. If this is true then females may benefit by using this trait as a mate choice cue through increased viability of their offspring.

These data were analysed using mixed effects models accounting for phylogenetic non-independence of species.Results: The severity and type of impacts generated by alien bird species are not randomly distributed with respect to their traits. Alien range size and habitat breadth were strongly associated with impact severity. Predation impacts were strongly associated with dietary preference, but also with alien range size, relative brain size and residence time. Impacts mediated by interactions with other alien species were related to alien range size and diet breadth.Main conclusions: Widely distributed generalist alien birds have the most severe environmental impacts. This may be because these species have greater opportunity to cause environmental impacts through their sheer number and ubiquity, but this could also be because they are more likely to be identified and studied.

However, covariance with structural canopy properties is hampering the ability to predict leaf biochemical traits in structurally heterogeneous forests. Here, we used imaging spectroscopy data to map canopy level leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations (P-mass) of a temperate mixed forest. By integrating predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), capturing the biophysical complexity of the canopy, we aimed at improving predictions of N-mass and P-mass. We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to link community weighted means of both leaf constituents with 245 hyperspectral bands (426-2425 nm) and 38 LiDAR-derived variables. LiDAR-derived variables improved the model's explained variances for N-mass (R-cv(2) 0.31 vs. 0.41, % RSMEcv 3.3 vs. 3.0) and P-mass (R-cv(2) 0.45 vs. 0.63, % RSMEcv 15.3 vs. 12.5). The predictive performances of N-mass models using hyperspectral bands only, decreased with increasing structural heterogeneity included in the calibration dataset. To test the independent contribution of canopy structure we additionally fit the models using only LiDAR-derived variables as predictors. Resulting values ranged from 0.26 for N-mass to 0.54 for 13,P-mass indicating considerable covariation between biochemical traits and forest structural properties. N-mass was negatively related to the spatial heterogeneity of canopy density, whereas Pm, was negatively related to stand height and to the total cover of tree canopies. In the specific setting of this study, the importance of structural variables can be attributed to the presence of two tree species, featuring structural and biochemical properties different from co-occurring species. Still, existing functional linkages between structure and biochemistry at the leaf and canopy level suggest that canopy structure, used as proxy, can in general support the mapping of leaf biochemistry over broad spatial extents.",10.1016/j.rse.2018.03.038,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = leaf N conc.

"Fajardo, A; Siefert, A",2016,Phenological variation of leaf functional traits within species,OECOLOGIA,"A basic assumption of the trait-based approach in plant ecology is that differences in functional trait values are greater between species than within species. We questioned this assumption by assessing (1) the relative extent of inter- and intraspecific leaf trait variation throughout a complete growing season (phenological variation) in a group of deciduous and evergreen woody species, and (2) whether species rankings based on leaf traits were maintained across the growing season. We analysed leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nutrient concentrations (C, N, P), including the C:N and N:P ratios. Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) due to phenology was significantly greater than interspecific variation for leaf N concentration on a mass basis (N-m; 68.90 %) and for the leaf C:N ratio (60.60 %), whereas interspecific variation was significantly higher than ITV for LMA (62.30 %) and for leaf C concentration on a mass (C-m) and area (C-a) basis (C-m 70.40 %; C-a 65.30 %). ITV was particularly low for LMA (< 20 %). Species rankings were highly modified by phenology for a number of leaf traits (P-m, N:P ratio) but were relatively well conserved throughout the growing season for others (LMA, N-m). Patterns of ITV across the growing season differed significantly between deciduous and evergreen species for all traits except leaf P but did not vary between native and exotic species. Overall, our results show that intraspecific phenological variation in leaf traits may be similar to or greater than interspecific variation and that temporal patterns of ITV vary considerably among traits and species, especially for leaf nutrient concentrations, factors which can potentially affect quantitative interspecific relationships.",10.1007/s00442-016-3545-1,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,"Looked at traits, but not environmental filtering",

"Fanelli, E; Papiol, V; Cartes, JE; Rodriguez-Romeu, O",2014,Trophic ecology of Lampanyctus crocodilus on north-west Mediterranean Sea slopes in relation to reproductive cycle and environmental variables,JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,"This study examined the population structure, reproductive cycle and feeding pattern of the lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus in the Balearic Basin (north-west Mediterranean Sea) from a depth of 450 to 1800m and at a seasonal scale. Juveniles were mainly located at shallower depths, but also at deepest stations in autumn, while adults mostly inhabited intermediate depths with their centre of population density (CPD) located at 800-1000m of depth. The migration of adults to deeper depths was detected in late summer to autumn, probably linked to the occurrence of nepheloid layers at c. 1200m, which in turn enhances the biomass of the zooplankton prey. The diet was mainly based on euphausiids and mysids, with marked seasonal variations both on the upper (450-800m) and lower (1000-1800m), where suprabenthic gammariids and pelagic decapods were also dominant. Stomach fullness increased from winter to autumn on the US, while it had a maximum in spring on the LS, in parallel with high consumption of gelatinous zooplankton, which is probably more available after the phytoplankton bloom in late winter. Reproduction occurred in winter, confirmed by the higher percentage of mature females and high gonadosomatic indices (IG) at both depth ranges. Hepatosomatic indices (IH) showed an inverse trend to IG on the US, except in autumn, and was almost parallel on the LS, probably attributable to the migration of adults, which determined different temporal schemes in energy use and storage for reproduction on the US v. LS. Consistent with the different patterns observed at the two depth ranges, environmental drivers of fullness (i.e. feeding intensity) and IG (as a proxy of reproductive cycle) differed on the US and LS. The biomass of mysids and euphausiids was the greatest explanatory variables of fullness on the US and LS, pointing to the increasing feeding intensity when a resource was more available. IH also explained fullness, suggesting that greater feeding intensity in pre-reproductive periods enabled energy storage in the liver. IG was linked directly (i.e. mysids) or indirectly (i.e. surface primary production recorded 2 months before sampling) to food availability, implying a rapid response to vertical food inputs by deep-sea predators. Also, IG in L. crocodilus was related to population density, which suggests aggregations for reproduction. Estimates of L. crocodilus trophic levels, and of other accompanying mesopelagic fishes, indicated that the species feed through a continuum spanning the third trophic level, confirming the key role of mesopelagic fishes in transferring organic carbon between trophic levels. Trophic niche segregation among mesopelagic species was pronounced and non-overlapping groups could be distinguished because of the different vertical distribution and migratory behaviour. The study highlights the important role of the benthic boundary layer in sustaining benthopelagic communities in the deep Mediterranean Sea and the need to study the biology of a species throughout its whole depth range and not just at exploited depths (i.e. fishing grounds).

The experiment was three months long. A total of 51 taxa were observed in the microcosms, but data analyses of the species composition and abundances revealed that five species, Capitella spp., Gammaropsis maculata, Erichtionus punctatus, Nereiphylla paretti and Harmothoe mariannae, explained most of the observed variation in the assembly process. The population dynamics of these species were simulated taking into account functional traits that govern individual interactions. The dynamic model simulated a demographic stochasticity due to low population densities that result from the small size of the experimental microcosms.

The dominant influential factors changed from abiotic (especially topographic factors) to biotic (e.g., basal area), with both increasing successional stage and tree size, suggesting that deterministic processes shifted from habitat filtering to biotic interactions.ContextDisentangling how deterministic and stochastic processes govern the temporal change of community composition is critical for understanding community assembly and predicting long-term ecosystem change. However, rare studies have examined the distinctive imprint of these two processes on functional and phylogenetic temporal changes of woody species in temperate forests.AimsThe objectives of this study are to detect (1) the relative importance of deterministic vs. stochastic process in driving the functional and phylogenetic temporal changes at different successional stages and tree size classes in temperate forests and (2) the relative influence of abiotic vs. biotic factors on temporal change.MethodsWe analyzed 10 years of detailed species composition, phylogenetic information, and 14 functional traits from 66 woody species in young-growth (5-ha) and old-growth (25-ha) forest plots in Northeast China. We devised a null model approach to determine the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in driving functional and phylogenetic temporal changes. Then, we investigated the influence of abiotic (soil and topography) and biotic (basal area, stem density, and species richness) factors on temporal change using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. All analyses were conducted for different tree sizes (all trees, small trees [diameter at breast height (DBH) < 10 cm], and large trees [DBH 10 cm]).ResultsIn young-growth forest, functional and phylogenetic temporal changes were basically higher than expected for all trees, small trees, and large trees. Conversely, in the old-growth forest, functional and phylogenetic temporal changes were lower than expected for all trees, but opposite patterns were found for two size classes; i.e., change was higher than expected for large trees and lower than expected for small trees. BRT models showed that the most influential factors underlying the temporal change of all trees shifted from abiotic (e.g., topography) to biotic (e.g., basal area) factors with increasing succession stage. Regardless of successional stage, the relevant factors changed from abiotic factors for small trees to biotic factors for large trees.ConclusionDeterministic processes govern tree functional and phylogenetic temporal changes, and the underlying deterministic processes change from habitat filtering to biotic interaction over succession and with increasing tree size.",10.1007/s13595-019-0830-2,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Traits  = leaf dry matter content, SLA, leaf area, leaf carbon content, leaf N content, Leaf K content, Leaf N15 composition, leaf C13 composition, trunk bark thickness, wood density, specific root length, root diameter, height, leaf dimension, stem dimension, root diemnsion",

Changes in land use and habitat fragmentation are major drivers of global change, and studying their effects on biodiversity constitutes a major research programme. However, biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, with a functional component linking species richness to ecosystem function. Currently, the interaction between functional and taxonomic components of biodiversity under realistic scenarios of habitat degradation is poorly understood. 2. The expected functional richness (FR)-species richness relationship (FRSR) is positive, and attenuated for functional redundancy in species-rich assemblages. Further, environmental filters are expected to flatten that association by sorting species with similar traits. Thus, analysing FRSR can inform about the response of biodiversity to environmental gradients and habitat fragmentation, and its expected functional consequences. 3. Top predators affect ecosystem functioning through prey consumption and are particularly vulnerable to changes in land use and habitat fragmentation, being good indicators of ecosystem health and suitable models for assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation on their FR. 4. Thus, this study analyses the functional redundancy of a vertebrate predator assemblage at temperate forest fragments in a rural landscape of Chiloe island (Chile), testing the existence of environmental filters by contrasting an empirically derived FRSR against those predicted from null models, and testing the association between biodiversity components and the structure of forest fragments. 5. Overall, contrasts against null models indicate that regional factors determine low levels of FR and redundancy for the vertebrate predator assemblage studied, while recorded linear FRSR indicates proportional responses of the two biodiversity components to the structure of forest fragments. Further, most species were positively associated with either fragment size or shape complexity, which are highly correlated. This, and the absence of ecological filters at the single-fragment scale, rendered taxonomically and functionally richer predator assemblages at large complex-shaped fragments. 6. These results predict strong effects of deforestation on both components of biodiversity, potentially affecting the functioning of remnants of native temperate forest ecosystems.

"Farkas, JZ; Morozov, AY",2014,Modelling Effects of Rapid Evolution on Persistence and Stability in Structured Predator-Prey Systems,MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA,"In this paper we explore the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a predator-prey model, where the prey population is structured according to a certain life history trait. The trait distribution within the prey population is the result of interplay between genetic inheritance and mutation, as well as selectivity in the consumption of prey by the predator. The evolutionary processes are considered to take place on the same time scale as ecological dynamics, i.e. we consider the evolution to be rapid. Previously published results show that population structuring and rapid evolution in such predator-prey system can stabilize an otherwise globally unstable dynamics even with an unlimited carrying capacity of prey. However, those findings were only based on direct numerical simulation of equations and obtained for particular parameterizations of model functions, which obviously calls into question the correctness and generality of the previous results. The main objective of the current study is to treat the model analytically and consider various parameterizations of predator selectivity and inheritance kernel. We investigate the existence of a coexistence stationary state in the model and carry out stability analysis of this state. We derive expressions for the Hopf bifurcation curve which can be used for constructing bifurcation diagrams in the parameter space without the need for a direct numerical simulation of the underlying integro-differential equations. We analytically show the possibility of stabilization of a globally unstable predator-prey system with prey structuring. We prove that the coexistence stationary state is stable when the saturation in the predation term is low. Finally, for a class of kernels describing genetic inheritance and mutation we show that stability of the predator-prey interaction will require a selectivity of predation according to the life trait.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

This study uses phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate which functional traits of bat species are correlated with their vulnerability to fragmentation in a tropical landscape with low fragment-matrix contrast. Bats were captured over twoyears in eight forest fragments, nine control sites in continuous forest, and in the secondary forest matrix at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazon, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between species functional traits, environmental gradients (continuous forest and fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and patterns of species distribution using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, as well as a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Mobility, body mass, wing morphology, and trophic level were the most important traits linked to fragmentation sensitivity based on the PGLS analysis, while body mass and trophic level emerged as the best predictors in the fourth-corner analysis. These last two traits were correlated with the loss of continuous forest characteristics, such as high-stature trees and forest cover. Many animalivorous bat species rarely persist in small fragments (<100ha) and in the secondary forest matrix, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit the smaller and phytophagous species.Synthesis and applications. Functional traits of species and environmental variables jointly predict local variation in patterns of bat occupancy and abundance in fragmented tropical landscapes. To minimize local extinctions, we recommend increasing habitat availability and enhancing structural and functional connectivity at the landscape scale through the creation, restoration and maintenance of corridors and stepping stones. These measures should be coupled with improving matrix quality by promoting secondary forest regeneration and persistence to effectively reduce fragment-matrix contrast.

"Fausch, KD; Taniguchi, Y; Nakano, S; Grossman, GD; Townsend, CR",2001,Flood disturbance regimes influence rainbow trout invasion success among five holarctic regions,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"There is growing awareness that predicting biological invasions will require the development of conceptual models for specific taxa at appropriate scales. Salmonids are ideal taxa for testing factors that influence invasions, because large numbers have been introduced worldwide for long periods and their ecology is well known. We evaluated the hypothesis that, among regions with suitable water temperatures, environmental resistance from flood disturbances that wash away trout fry strongly influence invasion success of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the most widely introduced fish species. We predicted that flow regimes in regions where rainbow trout invasions are successful would match those in their native range and would differ from those in regions where invasions are moderately successful or failed. We tested six specific predictions about how timing, predictability, frequency, duration, and annual variability of floods, as well as timing of low flows, will differ relative to timing of rainbow trout fry emergence among five Holarctic regions. Analysis of hydrologic regimes for eight rivers each in the native range (Pacific Coast) and four regions where rainbow trout invasions varied from highly successful (Southern Appalachians) to moderate (Colorado, USA, and Hokkaido Island, Japan) or failed (Honshu Island) showed that winter flooding and summer low flows in Pacific Coast rivers that favor spring emergence of rainbow trout were closely matched by Southern Appalachian flow regimes. In contrast, the other three regions had spring or summer flooding that hampered rainbow trout recruitment to different degrees, and winter low flows. Rainbow trout invasion success was best explained by a match between timing of fry emergence and months of low flood probability. Alternatively, cold water temperatures, which hamper reproduction, and biotic interactions with brown trout (Salmo trutta) and whirling disease parasites may account for low invasion success in European regions. However, differences in genetic makeup of donor stocks and propagule pressure are unlikely mechanisms to explain invasions. Understanding how abiotic disturbances interact with timing of critical life history events to limit normative species will help ecologists develop more robust theories to predict invasion success.",10.2307/3060931,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

We studied the general biology, distribution and climatic limits of seven chestnut species from around the world. We provided climatic matching of Asiatic species to North America to assist the range-wide restoration of American chestnut [C. dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.] by incorporating blight-resistant genes from Asiatic species. Location North America, Europe and East Asia. Methods General chestnut biology was reviewed on the basis of published literature and field observations. Chestnut distributions were established using published range maps and literature. Climatic constraints were analysed for the northern and southern distribution limits and the entire range for each species using principal component analysis (PCA) of fourteen bioclimatic variables. Climatic envelope matching was performed for three Chinese species using Maxent modelling to predict corresponding suitable climate zones for those species in North America. Results Chestnuts are primarily distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical zones in the northern hemisphere. PCA results revealed that thermal gradient was the primary control of chestnut distribution. Climatic spaces of different species overlap with one another to different degrees, but strong similarities are shown especially between Chinese species and American species. Climatic envelope matching suggested that large areas in eastern North America have a favourable climate for Chinese species. Main conclusions The general biological traits and climatic limits of the seven chestnut species are very similar. The predictions of Chinese species climatic range corresponded with most of the historical American chestnut range. Thus, a regionally adapted, blight-resistant, introgressed hybrid American chestnut appears feasible if a sufficiently diverse array of Chinese chestnut germplasm is used as a source of blight resistance. Our study provided a between-continent climate matching approach to facilitate the range-wide species restoration, which can be readily applied in planning the restoration of other threatened or endangered species.",10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00886.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,no traits ,
"Feit, B; Letnic, M",2015,Species level traits determine positive and negative population impacts of invasive cane toads on native squamates,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"The novel interactions posed by invasive species can have complex effects on ecosystems owing to both their direct and indirect effects on other species. Consequently, the effects of invasive species can be hard to forecast owing to the diversity of interaction-pathways and number of species they can potentially affect. Ultimately, the strength and direction of an invader's inter-specific effects will be determined by both the traits of the invader and the species they interact with. The cane toad (Rhinella marina) is a highly successful invasive species that poses a serious threat to ecosystem integrity in tropical Australia. Reptilian predators have been particularly affected by the invasion of cane toads because toads possess toxins that are novel to native Australian predators. We used a meta-regression approach to explore how cane toads' impacts on Australian squamates are modulated by their phylogenetic, behavioural and morphological traits. Species primarily foraging in riparian and terrestrial habitats tended to decline in abundance while population sizes of arboreal squamates might have increased following toad arrival. The negative impact of cane toads on anurophagous squamates scaled with gape size and body mass. Squamate species with smaller heads or body mass tended to increase in abundance while species with larger heads or body mass tended to decline. Our study provides insight into the complexity of impacts that invasive species can have on native species assemblages and highlights how morphological and behavioural factors can mediate the impact of invasive on native species.",10.1007/s10531-014-0850-z,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Metanalysis,Terrestrial,Herps,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,0,0,1,,,0,E,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"Traits = habitat, anurophagy, head width, body mass, ",
"Fell, M; Ogle, K",2018,Refinement of a theoretical trait space for North American trees via environmental filtering,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"We refer to a theoretical trait space (TTS) as an n-dimensional hypervolume (hypercube) characterizing the range of values and covariations among multiple functional traits, in the absence of explicit filtering mechanisms. We previously constructed a 32-dimensional TTS for North American trees by fitting the Allometrically Constrained Growth and Carbon Allocation (ACGCA) model to USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Here, we sampled traits from this TTS, representing different individual ""trees,"" and subjected these trees to a series of gap dynamics simulations resulting in different annual light levels to explore the impact of environmental filtering (light stress) on the trait space. Variation in light limitation led to non-random mortality and a refinement of the TTS. We investigated potential mechanisms underlying such filtering processes by exploring how traits and the environment relate to mortality rates at the tree, phenotype (a specific set of trait values), and stand (a specific gap scenario) levels. The average light level at the forest floor explained 42% of the stand-level mortality, while phenotype- and tree-level mortality were best explained by six functional traits, especially radiation-use efficiency, maximum tree height, and xylem conducting area to sapwood area ratio (gamma(X)). These six ""mortality"" traits and six traits related to the leaf and wood economics spectra were used to construct trait hypercubes represented by trees that died or survived each gap scenario. For trees that survived, the volume of their refined trait space decreased linearly with increasing stand-level mortality (up to similar to 50% mortality); the location also shifted, as indicated by non-zero distances between the hypercube centroids of surviving trees compared to dead trees and the original TTS. Overall, the patterns were consistent with empirical studies of functional traits, in terms of which traits predict mortality and the direction of the relationships. This work, however, also identified potentially important functional traits that are not commonly measured in empirical studies, such as gamma(X) and senescence rates of relatively long-lived tissues.",10.1002/ecm.1294/full,Y,0,0,0,0,0,0,T Model,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,1,1,1,1,0,"Morphological, Physiological, Life History",3,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = there's like 35 traits, in table 1 of the text.

Various models have been put forward to explain the relative effects of environmental filtering, dispersal, and species traits on community composition. Here, we focus on complex, three-dimensional webs of two social and two solitary spider species as habitat patches for associated communities of arthropods in a tropical rainforest in Ecuador. We used variance partitioning, constrained ordination, coherence analyses, and a colonization experiment to assess the role of environmental filtering and dispersal in this system. We found that the composition of communities associated with the four host species was mostly differentiated along two ordination axes, with the first axis roughly corresponding to level of sociality (solitary vs. social) and the other to web size. Associate abundance increased, but their density per unit volume decreased with host web size for all host species. Webs of social spider species had more variable communities and proportionally more aggressive (i.e., predatory) associates. After rarefaction to control for larger samples in larger webs, only one of the species showed a significant increase of species richness as a function of web size. The relatively quick colonization of experimentally established webs suggests high dispersal of more generalist species, but their lower proportion in older webs provides some evidence of a colonization-competition trade-off at longer temporal scales. The distinctness of the communities associated with the four host species, and the eventual change in proportion of associates in newly founded vs. old webs, despite high dispersal, is consistent with environmental filtering and species traits playing a major role in determining patterns of species distribution in this system.",10.1002/ecs2.2101,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Insects,Tropical Rainforest,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,0,1,0,,,0,P,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits Used = sociality, total volumne of tangle webbing, density of silk lines in the tangle webbing.

Here we argue that for animals that live and forage in groups, level of sociality, reflecting differences in group size and cooperative tendencies, can be an additional and powerful dimension separating species in niche space. We compare 50+ communities of the social spider genus Anelosimus across the Americas against a null model that accounts for known effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the distribution of social systems in the genus. We show that these communities are more overdispersed than expected by chance in either or both body size and level of sociality, traits we have previously shown to be associated with differences in resource utilization (prey size, microhabitat, and phenology). We further show that the contribution of sociality to differences in the size of the prey captured is two to three times greater than that of body size, suggesting that changes in group size and cooperative tendencies may be more effective than changes in body size at separating species in niche space.",10.1073/pnas.1721464115,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = body size, sociality.

Two hypotheses were tested, that (1) the germination niche shape (i.e. the preference for a set of germination cues as opposed to another) would differ between beaches and cliffs to prevent seedling emergence in the less favourable season (winter and summer, respectively); and (2) the germination niche breadth (i.e. the amplitude of germination cues) would be narrower in the seawards communities, where environmental filtering is stronger. Methods Seeds of 30 specialist species of coastal plant communities were collected in natural populations of northern Spain. Their germination was measured in six laboratory treatments based on field temperatures. Germination niche shape was estimated as the best germination temperature. Germination niche breadth was calculated using Pielou's evenness index. Differences between plant communities in their germination niche shape and breadth were tested using phylogenetic generalized least squares regression (PGLS). Key Results Germination niche shape differed between communities, being warm-cued in beaches (best germination temperature -20 degrees C) and cold-cued in cliffs (14 degrees C). Germination niche was narrowest in seawards beaches (Pielou's index = 0.89) and broadest in landwards beaches (0.99). Cliffs had an intermediate germination niche breadth (0.95). The relationship between niche and plant community had a positive phylogenetic signal for shape (Pagel's lambda = 0.64) and a negative one for breadth (Pagel's lambda = -1.71). Conclusion Environmental filters shape the germination niche to prevent emergence in the season of highest threat for seedling establishment. The germination niche breadth is narrower in the communities with stronger environmental filters, but only in beaches. This study provides empirical support to a community-level generalization of the hypotheses about the environmental drivers of the germination niche.

"Fernandez-Pascual, Eduardo; Mattana, Efisio; Pritchard, Hugh W.",2019,Seeds of future past: climate change and the thermal memory of plant reproductive traits,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,"Plant persistence and migration in face of climate change depends on successful reproduction by seed, a central aspect of plant life that drives population dynamics, community assembly and species distributions. Plant reproduction by seed is a chain of physiological processes, the rates of which are a function of temperature, and can be modelled using thermal time models. Importantly, while seed reproduction responds to its instantaneous thermal environment, there is also evidence of phenotypic plasticity in response to the thermal history experienced by the plant's recent ancestors, by the reproducing plant since seedling establishment, and by its seeds both before and after their release. This phenotypic plasticity enables a thermal memory of plant reproduction, which allows individuals to acclimatise to their surroundings. This review synthesises current knowledge on the thermal memory of plant reproduction by seed, and highlights its importance for modelling approaches based on physiological thermal time. We performed a comprehensive search in the Web of Science and analysed 533 relevant articles, of which 81 provided material for a meta-analysis of thermal memory in reproductive functional traits based on the effect size Zr. The articles encompassed the topics of seed development, seed yield (mass and number), seed dormancy (physiological, morphological and physical), germination, and seedling establishment. The results of the meta-analysis provide evidence for a thermal memory of seed yield, physiological dormancy and germination. Seed mass and physiological dormancy appear to be the central hubs of this memory. We argue for integrating thermal memory into a predictive framework based on physiological time modelling. This will provide a quantitative assessment of plant reproduction, a complex system that integrates past and present thermal inputs to achieve successful reproduction in changing environments. The effects of a warming environment on plant reproduction cannot be reduced to a qualitative interpretation of absolute positives and negatives. Rather, these effects need to be understood in terms of changing rates and thresholds for the physiological process that underlie reproduction by seed.",10.1111/brv.12461,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Metanalysis,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,1,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = seed mass, seed numbeber, germination proportion, time to 50% germination, seedling growth, effect of dormancy loss treatment on base germination temperature, base germination water potential, and termal tiem for 50% germination ",

The study site was contaminated by heavy metals from a zinc smelter that operated near Palmerton, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. C-3 plants only contributed 1.16% of aboveground primary productivity, whereas recently seeded (5-7 year old) warm season C-4 grasses contributed the remaining 98.84%. Analyses of tissue samples revealed that the carbon content of invertebrates and vertebrates did not reflect the composition of the vegetation. Of 135 samples, 48 (36%) had greater than 75% of their carbon from C-4-derived sources, while 32 (24%) of the samples had less than 25%. However, carbon from C-4 grasses passed through to higher trophic levels, as shown by the abundance of predators with a high proportion of C-4-derived carbon. We document three channels of carbon flux through the food web, one based on warm season grasses, now supporting a functioning ecosystem at all key trophic levels, one based on C-3 plants, and a third based on detritus. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that relative configurations of such channels are important to ecosystem stability. Our results suggest that functional groupings of plants based on photosynthetic pathway or other plant traits likely form the basis for food web compartments. By using diverse functional groups of plants for reclamation or restoration, practitioners may be able to aid the development of channels and thereby promote desired ecosystem states.",10.1111/rec.12202,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Field, IC; Meekan, MG; Buckworth, RC; Bradshaw, CJA",2009,"SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SHARKS, RAYS AND CHIMAERAS TO GLOBAL EXTINCTION","ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 56","Marine biodiversity worldwide is under increasing threat, primarily as a result of over-harvesting, pollution and climate change. Chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) have a perceived higher intrinsic risk of extinction compared to other fish. Direct fishing mortality has driven many declines, even though some smaller fisheries persist without associated declines. Mixed-species fisheries are of particular concern, as is illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The lack of specific management and reporting mechanisms for the latter means that many chondrichthyans might already be susceptible to extinction from stochastic processes entirely unrelated to fishing pressure itself. Chondrichthyans might also suffer relatively more than other marine taxa from the effects of fishing and habitat loss and degradation given coastal habitat use for specific life stages. The effects of invasive species and pollution are as yet too poorly understood to predict their long-term role in affecting chondrichthyan population sizes. The spatial distribution of threatened chondrichthyan species under World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List criteria are clustered mainly in (1) south-eastern South America; (2) western Europe and the Mediterranean; (3) western Africa; (4) South China Sea and Southeast Asia and (5) south-eastern Australia. To determine which ecological and life history traits predispose chondrichthyans to being IUCN Red-Listed, and to examine the role of particular human activities in exacerbating threat risk, we correlated extant marine species' Red List categorisation with available ecological (habitat type, temperature preference), life history (body length, range size) and human-relationship (whether commercially or game-fished, considered dangerous to humans) variables. Threat risk correlations were constructed using generalised linear mixed-effect models to account for phylogenetic relatedness. We also contrasted results for chondrichthyans to marine teleosts to test explicitly whether the former group is intrinsically more susceptible to extinction than fishes in general. Around 52% of chondrichthyans have been Red-Listed compared to only 8% of all marine teleosts; however, listed teleosts were in general placed more frequently into the higher-risk categories relative to chondrichthyans. IUCN threat risk in both taxa was positively correlated with body size and negatively correlated albeit weakly, with geographic range size. Even after accounting for the positive influence of size, Red-Listed teleosts were still more likely than chondrichthyans to be classified as threatened. We suggest that while sharks might not have necessarily experienced the same magnitude of deterministic decline as Red-Listed teleosts, their larger size and lower fecundity (not included in the analysis) predispose chondrichthyans to a higher risk of extinction overall. Removal of these large predators can elicit trophic cascades and destabilise the relative abundance of smaller species. Predator depletions can lead to permanent shifts in marine communities and alternate equilibrium states. Climate change might influence the phenology and physiology of some species, with the most probable response being changes in the timing of migrations and shifts in distribution. The synergistic effects among harvesting, habitat changes and climate-induced forcings are greatest for coastal chondrichthyans with specific habitat requirements and these are currently the most likely candidates for extinction. Management of shark populations must take into acount the rate at which drivers of decline affect specific species. Only through the detailed collection of data describing demographic rates, habitat affinities, trophic linkages and geographic ranges, and how environmental stressors modify these, can extinction risk be more precisely estimated and reduced. The estimation of minimum viable population sizes, below which rapid extinction is more likely due to stochastic processes, is an important component of this endeavour and should accompany many of the current approaches used in shark management worldwide.",10.1016/S0065-2881(09)56004-X,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Marine,Fish,Broad,1,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,1,"Traits = habitat type, temperature prefernce, body length, range size, comerical/game fished, dangerous to humans.

CATs can be used to quantify the mean and variance of functional traits found in a given community. A CAT-based strategy will often yield far more useful information for predicting the functional attributes of diverse microbial communities and changes in those attributes than the more commonly used analytical strategies.

Understanding how phytophagous insects invade a new patch is of great agricultural importance.2 Here, we investigated how aphids colonize a wheat field by studying the spatial and temporal dynamics of their populations at large (field) and fine (group of host plants) scales.3 The sampling design consisted of counting and locating aphid colonies within 30 0.25 m(2) squares randomly spaced in a 1.5-ha winter wheat field over 2 months. All colonies were precisely located within the squares and their composition in terms of morphs was determined.4 We show that: (i) immigration of winged aphids was a major factor driving the aphid population dynamics during a large part of the season and (ii) within the field, populations established late in the growing season. Aggregated, populations of aphids became progressively homogeneously distributed at the field scale. At the scale of a 0.25 m(2) square, infested plants were clustered in randomly distributed small patches, and aphid colonies experienced high extinction rates, suggesting failure in population establishment.5 Because immigration may considerably influence both population dynamics and spatial distribution, our study suggests that future predictive models should give a greater weight to spring immigrants.",10.1111/j.1461-9563.2007.00331.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

A review of current literature indicates cell size and elemental stoichiometry often respond predictably to abiotic conditions and follow biophysical rules that link environmental conditions to growth rates, and growth rates to food web interactions, and consequently to the biogeochemical cycling of elements. This suggests that cell size and elemental stoichiometry are promising ecophysiological traits for modelling and tracking changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to climate change. In turn, these changes are expected to have further impacts on phytoplankton community structure through as yet poorly understood secondary processes associated with trophic dynamics.",10.1093/plankt/fbp098,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Marine,Plankton,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,,"Taxonomic = phytoplankton.

"Finney, DM; Kaye, JP",2017,Functional diversity in cover crop polycultures increases multifunctionality of an agricultural system,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. Ecological studies identifying a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services motivate projections that higher plant diversity will increase services from agroecosystems. While this idea is compelling, evidence of generalizable relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services that could be broadly applied in agricultural systems is lacking. 2. Cover crops grown in rotation with cash crops are a realistic strategy to increase agroecosystem diversity. We evaluated the prediction that further increasing diversity with cover crop polycultures would enhance ecosystem services and multifunctionality in a 2-year study of eighteen cover crop treatments ranging in diversity from one to eight species. Five ecosystem services were measured in each cover crop system and regression analysis used to explore the relationship between multifunctionality and several diversity indices. 3. As expected, there was a positive relationship between species richness and multifunctionality, but it only explained a small fraction of variance in ecosystem services ( marginal R-2 = 0.05). In contrast, indices of functional diversity, particularly the distribution of trait abundances, were stronger predictors of multifunctionality (marginal R-2 = 0.15-0.38). 4. Synthesis and application. In a corn production system, simply increasing cover crop species richness will have a small impact on agroecosystem services, but designing polycultures that maximize functional diversity may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality.",10.1111/1365-2664.12765,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

These extinctions have been restricted to southern Australia, predominantly in species of critical weight range' (35-5500g) in drier climate zones. Introduced red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) that prey on species in this range are often blamed. A new wave of declines is now affecting a globally significant proportion of marsupial species (19 species) in the fox-free northern tropics. We aim to test plausible causes of recent declines in range and determine if mechanisms differ between current tropical declines and past declines, which were in southern (non-tropical) regions.LocationAustralian continentMethodsWe used multiple regression and random forest models to analyse traits that were associated with declines in species range, and compare variables associated with past extinctions in the southern zones with current tropical (northern) declines.ResultsThe same two key variables, body mass and habitat structure, were associated with proportion-of-decline in range throughout the continent, but the form of relationships differs with latitude. In the south, medium-sized species in open habitats of lower rainfall were most likely to decline. In the tropics, small species that occupy open vegetation with moderate rainfall (savanna) are now experiencing the most severe declines. Throughout the continent, large-bodied species and those in structurally complex habitats (rainforest) are secure.Main conclusionsOur results indicate that there is no mid-sized critical weight range' in the north. Because foxes are absent from the tropics, we suggest that northern Australian marsupial declines are associated with predation by feral cats (Felis catus) exacerbated by reduced ground level vegetation in non-rainforest habitats. To test this, we recommend experiments to remove cats from some locations where tropical mammals are threatened.

Here we investigate the performance of the model for an example biome boundary in eastern North America. We explore the sensitivity of the predicted biome boundaries and ecosystem properties to the variation of leaf properties using the parameter space defined by the GLOPNET global leaf trait database.

The default assumption is that the costs and benefits of deciduous vs. evergreen leaf strategies, in terms of carbon assimilation and expenditure, can reproduce the geographical structure of biome boundaries and ecosystem functioning. We find some support for this assumption, but only under particular combinations of model traits and structural assumptions. Many questions remain regarding the preferred methods for deployment of plant trait information in land surface models. In some cases, plant traits might best be closely linked to each other, but we also find support for direct linkages to environmental conditions.

"Fitzgerald, DB; Winemiller, KO; Perez, MHS; Sousa, LM",2017,Using trophic structure to reveal patterns of trait-based community assembly across niche dimensions,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"1. Trait-based approaches for studying community assembly have improved understanding of mechanisms; however, the challenge of interpreting process from pattern is complicated by the possibility of multiple mechanisms operating simultaneously. Different traits may influence the assembly process in different ways. Analysing patterns of functional diversity among co-occurring species for each trait individually may aid interpretation of complex assembly processes; yet, few studies have tested whether patterns vary depending on trait function. 2. We used tropical fish assemblages from the Xingu River, Brazil to test whether traits associated with resource acquisition play a stronger role in niche segregation relative to other traits. First, a null modelling approach was used to determine how trait distributions within local assemblages deviated from expectations under random assembly. Then, correlations between functional traits and stable isotope ratios (C-13, N-15) were used as a measure of a trait's association with trophic structure. Finally, we used mixed effects models to test whether traits having higher correlations with trophic structure also had greater deviation from null expectations. In addition, we explored how well stable isotopes explain multivariate functional trait variation and compared our correlation-based approach for organizing traits with previous categorical approaches. 3. A significant relationship was found between a trait's deviation from null expectations and its correlation with isotopic patterns. Traits strongly associated with trophic structure had greater dispersion from the assemblage mean and were more evenly spaced than weakly associated traits. Traits strongly associated with trophic structure also were more clustered because trophic diversification tended to occur around some basic feeding strategies, such as benthic grazing or capturing food items from the water column. Based on redundancy analysis, isotopic ratios explained a low (116%) but significant portion of trait variation. 4. In this study system, traits strongly associated with trophic ecology were more influential in niche differentiation among coexisting species compared to weakly associated traits. These results suggest that certain traits may respond to assembly mechanisms in predictable ways despite the complex, multidimensional nature of the assembly process.

"Flueck, WT",2000,"Population regulation in large northern herbivores: evolution, thermodynamics, and large predators",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR JAGDWISSENSCHAFT,"Understanding population regulation of large northern herbivores like cervids has important practical and theoretical implications. Corrective measures for high densities of cervids must be based on theory and thus necessitate analysis of contradicting views of top-down and bottom-up population control. The former considers cervids incapable of self-regulation and hence that they need external factors like predation to achieve effective population regulation. The latter claims that cervids exhibit: the capacity re adjust their numbers to the food supply as shown by physiological responses. Hoever, these phenomena are not an expression of evolutionary adaption, they are a predictable physiological reaction to reduced food. In addition, studies were often done in man-modified environments or without considerations of modulating effects through predators. It is unlikely to study pristine relationships between large herbivores and predators in the future through field work, and insights from other fields need to be heeded. Considerations from evolution, thermodynamics, food webs and nutrient cycling indicate that the development of biological systems is unidirectional due to irreversible processes and leads toward optimal order and optimal accumulation of energy and nutrients. Large predators are thus nor just a luxury development of evolution, but a necessary sequel to natural laws and they increase efficiency of the system to capture solar energy. It explains why analogous ecomorphs, like saber-tooth ""cats"" (placental and marsupial) have re-evolved independently at least 5 times. As a group, large predators developed traits allowing self-regulation including territoriality, intra- and interspecific killing, prey-switching, and dispersal. However, in man-modified environments, herbivore densities can reach such high levels that even an intact predator community will no longer exert regulation as there is an upper limit of predator density determined by social mechanisms. As kill success rates are very low, predators also affect herbivores by largely determining spacial distribution and behavioral adaptions, all of which modify herbivore-plant interactions. Cervids on the other hand exhibit traits all indicative of absence of a capacity to self-regulate. Predictable physiological responses to reduced food intake thus operate so late that the typical population response is an irruption with subsequent major dieoff and leads to a reduction in system performance including loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the claim that there exists ""natural"" regulation in such situations is an erroneous term for what is better called forced starvation. Two conclusions can be drawn: 1. Herbivore densities above a critical level will inevitably cause shifts in community functioning by altering plant and animal species composition, nutrient and energy flow patterns: the system will effectively be forced to a less complex and hence, less productive level, an evolutionary step backwards. 2. By having modified ecological parameters necessary for the welfare of herbivores, we need to take on the responsibility to guarantee their future welfare by actively replacing missing factors. For cervids it may mean implementing harvesting such that population densities permit natural plant rejuvenation and optimal biodiversity. Where the predator community is still intact, it should be protected by all means, and where still possible, predator communities should be restored. A basic tool is to disseminate the best available information, namely that large northern herbivores do nor exhibit self regulation.",10.1007/BF02241353,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Flugge, AJ; Olhede, SC; Murrell, DJ",2014,A method to detect subcommunities from multivariate spatial associations,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Species are seldom distributed at random across a community, but instead show spatial structure that is determined by environmental gradients and/or biotic interactions. Analysis of the spatial co-associations of species may therefore reveal information on the processes that helped to shape those patterns. We propose a multivariate approach that uses the spatial co-associations between all pairs of species to find subcommunities of species whose distribution in the study area is positively correlated. Our method, which begins with the patterns of individuals, is particularly well-suited for communities with large numbers of species and gives rare species an equal weight. We propose a method to quantify a maximum number of subcommunities that are significantly more correlated than expected under a null model of species independence. Using data on the distribution of tree and shrub species from a 50ha forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, we show that our method can be used to construct biologically meaningful subcommunities that are linked to the spatial structure of the plant community. As an example, we construct spatial maps from the subcommunities that closely follow habitats based on environmental gradients (such as slope) as well as different biotic conditions (such as canopy gaps). We discuss extensions and adaptations to our method that might be appropriate for other types of spatially referenced data and for other ecological communities. We make suggestions for other ways to interpret the subcommunities using phylogenetic relationships, biological traits and environmental variables as covariates and note that subcommunities that are hard to interpret may suggest groups of species and/or regions of the landscape that merit further attention.",10.1111/2041-210X.12295,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

To isolate changes in FD from changes in species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of FD values. In over one-quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by agriculture, declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number.

The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two-and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.",10.1890/10-1245.1,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Traits = leaf N %, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, N fixation",

Since lower level BD at genetic, individual, and population levels largely determines the functionality and resilience of natural populations and communities, individual level measures promise to link EC-induced physiological, ecological, and evolutionary responses to EF. Intraspecific trait differences, while representing among the least-understood aspects of natural microbial communities, have recently become easier to measure due to new technology. For example, recent advance in scanning flow-cytometry (SCF), automation of phytoplankton sampling and integration with environmental sensors allow to measure morphological and physiological traits of individual algae with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we present emerging features of automated SFC data from natural phytoplankton communities and the opportunities that they provide for understanding the functioning of complex aquatic microbial communities. We highlight some current limitations and future needs, particularly focusing on the large amount of individual level data that, for the purpose of understanding the EC-BD-EF link, need to be translated into meaningful BD indices. We review the available functional diversity (FD) indices that, despite having been designed for mean trait values at the species level, can be adapted to individual-based trait data and provide links to ecological theory. We conclude that, considering some computational, mathematical and ecological issues, a set of multi-dimensional indices that address richness, evenness and divergence in overall community trait space represent the most promising BD metrics to study EC-BD-EF using individual level data.",10.3389/fmicb.2014.00324,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Most ecological indicators include species richness as a metric. Others, such as functional traits and phylogenetic diversity, account for differences in species, even when species richness is the same. Here, we describe and apply a different indicator, called morphoscape dimension, accounting for morphological variability across habitats in a geographical region. We use the case of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in four different habitats in the Po Plain in Northern Italy to exemplify how to quantify the magnitude of the morphological space (i.e. the dimension of the morphoscape) occupied by the species in each habitat using geometric morphometrics. To this aim, we employed a variety of metrics of morphological disparity related to univariate size, and more complex multivariate shape and form. Our 'proof of concept' suggests that metrics assessing size and form might largely tend to simply mirror the information provided by species richness, whereas shape morphoscape disparity may be able to account for non-trivial differences in species traits amongst habitats. This is indicated by the woodland morphoscape being on average bigger than that of crops, the most species-rich habitat, despite having almost 20% less species. We conclude suggesting that the analysis of morphoscape dimension has the potential to become a new additional and complimentary tool in the hands of conservation biologists and ecologists to explore and quantify habitat complexity and inform decisions on management and conservation based on a wide set of ecological indicators.",10.1007/s00114-017-1475-3,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,Traits = morphological landmarks and subsequent morphospace,

Measures of extinction risk, which quantify threats to population persistence, are particularly sensitive to life-history traits, such as recruitment response to fire, which explained approximately 60% of the deviance in expected minimum abundance. Dispersal dynamics and habitat patch structure have the strongest influence on the amount of movement of the trailing and leading edge of the range margin, explaining roughly 40% of modeled structural deviance. These results underscore the need to consider direct measures of extinction risk (population declines and other measures of stochastic viability), as well as measures of change in habitat area, when assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity.

The objective of this study was thus to observe the impact of a soil ecosystem engineer (Lumbricus terrestris L.) on plant communities as well as on soil organisms (springtails) in a reclaimed floodplain previously devoid of earthworms. Within a randomized factorial design based on buried frames (depth 0.45 m), half of the quadrats (1 m(2)) were inoculated with 100 earthworms, the other half served as control. After one year of experiment, earthworm inoculation doubled the plant biomass and favored grass species over forbs. Both abundance and diversity of Collembola (depending on functional groups) were negatively impacted by the presence of earthworms. Using a path analysis we found that this negative impact was probably indirect and due to an earthworm effect on plant community structure and plant functional groups. We suggest in our particular case that vegetation, and more precisely plant biomass and functional traits, may be more influential than soil properties in driving Collembola assemblages. Regarding restoration, we conclude that manipulating earthworms could be an interesting tool for increasing plant productivity but may disfavor soil biodiversity and alter above-belowground linkages.",10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.12.021,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

To determine whether colour morphs differ in thermal physiology, I assessed reaction distance and jumping performance of individuals belonging to different morphs at two different temperatures. Individuals allowed a potential predator to approach less closely and jumped longer distances at high than at low temperature. My analyses also uncovered variation among morphs in average reaction distance and jumping capacity, as well as in thermal sensitivity of these two traits. Matrix correlation analysis further revealed that pair-wise differences between morphs in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance (but not reaction distance) could be accurately predicted by differences in body temperatures preferred in a laboratory thermal gradient. These results support the view that morphology, behaviour and thermal physiology of ectotherms may evolve in concert. The relationship between reaction distance and jumping performance varied among colour morphs at high temperature, and the common within-morph relationship between these two traits deviated from the corresponding among-morph relationship. This suggests chat the variation among morphs has partially arisen through active divergence, with selection having influenced both traits and modifications having occurred to different degrees in different morphs. My data further suggest that pale colour morphs, with a limited capacity to attain high body temperatures, may not necessarily be at a selective disadvantage, because their physiology may be adapted to lower body temperatures.",10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00084.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,"Thought the temp could  be environmental filtering, but they didn't test it with respect to climate, just upped the organisms body temperature, so I said it wasn't relevant",

However, poor descriptions of spatial patterns of community functional composition across landscapes hamper accurate predictions, particularly in highly diverse tropical regions. Therefore, understanding how community functional composition varies across environmental gradients remains an important challenge. We sampled 15 functional traits in 800 Neotropical tree species across 13 forest plots representative of the broad climatic and soil gradients encompassed by three widespread lowland forest habitats (terra firme forests on clay-rich soils, seasonally flooded forests and white-sand forests) at opposite ends of Amazonia (Peru and French Guiana). We combined univariate and multivariate approaches to test the magnitude and predictability of environmental filtering on community leaf and wood functional composition. Directional shifts in community functional composition correlated with environmental changes across the 13 plots, with denser leaves, stems and roots in forests occurring in environments with limited water and soil-nutrient availability.

Our ability to make informed decisions for managing pressures depends on estimating their ecological effects, and a rigorous and objective approach should be used. There are three requirements for this type of approach to be successful: sufficient biological and ecological data, congruent data describing human activity and an appropriate statistical method that can link the ecological information to the pressures. In this work, we explore the effects of cumulative bottom-trawl fishing on fish assemblages over a 20-year period. The analysis captures assemblage responses during the early period of the fishery's development and shows the changes in the abundance of many species as a small and coherent set of archetypical' responses to cumulative pressure. The effect of the cumulative pressure is heterogeneous: some archetypical responses show consistent decline with increased fishing effort, some are less sensitive, and some show an increase in abundance. Some, but not all, archetypical response groups are composed of species with similar ecological and life-history traits. Most obviously, the archetype showing greatest decline in abundance is made up of species that have the highest mean values of generation time, oldest age at maturity and longest life span. Applications of the methods include identifying spatially explicit system-level trade-offs - between species, species groups (archetypes) and fishery subareas - for ecosystem-based management.Synthesis and applications The impact of fishing pressure, accumulated over time, induces heterogeneous patterns of change in fish assemblage composition. The patterns of change are grouped into archetypical response groups' to provide an interpretable and robust description.

"Fountain-Jones, NM; Baker, SC; Jordan, GJ",2015,Moving beyond the guild concept: developing a practical functional trait framework for terrestrial beetles,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,"1. New logical and analytical frameworks for studying functional traits have led to major advances in plant and freshwater ecology at local and global scales. The ecological and taxonomic diversity of terrestrial adult beetles (Coleoptera) means that functional trait approaches should have considerable power to illuminate the function not only of these animals but also of the ecosystems in which they occur. 2. Even though the functional trait concept is not new in ecology, it is still plagued with inconsistencies in methodology and terminology. Plant-based studies have shown that an integrated and relatively consistent functional trait approach facilitates comparisons between studies, and allows the full utility and predictive capacity of trait-based approaches to be realised. 3. This review outlines a logical framework for adult beetle functional trait studies using uniform terminology and methodology similar to those used by plant ecologists. Beetle life-history and ecomorphological trait studies are synthesised and it is shown that a combination of both is analogous to the functional trait approach. A general functional trait list for beetles and potential functional links is outlined, as are potential analysis approaches. A consistent functional trait approach, coupled with advances in molecular techniques, has the capability to provide deeper insights into beetle community assembly and how beetles impact ecosystems and will enable worldwide comparisons and predictions to be made.",10.1111/een.12158,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Such information can lead to higher comparability, transferability and predictability of the outcome of restoration projects. However, multitaxa trait-based approaches were rarely used in the context of ecosystem restoration. We investigated the responses to environmental gradients of seven taxa (vascular plants, staphylinid and carabid beetles, spiders, isopods, diplopods and earthworms) in a restored floodplain using a species traits approach. We assessed the impact of flood disturbances and soil hydric stress on the functional diversity (FD) and community-weighted mean (CWM) response of traits for each taxon. Ordination of hydrological variables revealed two main gradients. The first was related to the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood disturbances and the second to the average changes in soil hydric conditions. The analysis of CWM revealed that larger, poorly mobile species with narrow ecological tolerances were filtered by regular floods and/or changes in soil hydric conditions. Functional diversity patterns differed between the two gradients: decreasing with increasing flood disturbance, but increasing along the soil hydric stress gradient. This suggests that the mechanisms shaping community composition differ between the two gradients with environmental filtering being dominant with increasing flood disturbances and competition decreasing with more soil hydric stress.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the impact of restored flood disturbances and soil hydric stress on plant and invertebrate functional diversity and community-weighted mean can be positive, negative or more complex depending on the taxonomic group and environmental gradient considered. The patterns can to some extent be explained by the specific characteristics of each group. Larger, poorly mobile species with narrow ecological tolerances were particularly vulnerable to changes in disturbance and stress regime following floodplain restoration. These species may therefore be lost in the initial phases of restoration projects, but other more characteristic species of dynamic floodplains will be favoured.

Biotic interactions, environmental filtering and neutral processes are among the main mechanisms evoked to explain species co-occurrence. However, they are most often studied separately or even considered as mutually exclusive. This likely hampers a more global understanding of species assembly. Here, we investigate the general hypothesis that the structure of co-occurrence networks results from multiple assembly rules and its potential implications for grassland ecosystems. We surveyed orthopteran and plant communities in 48 permanent grasslands of the French Jura Mountains and gathered functional and phylogenetic data for all species. We constructed a network of plant and orthopteran species co-occurrences and verified whether its structure was modular or nested. We investigated the role of all species in the structure of the network (modularity and nestedness). We also investigated the assembly rules driving the structure of the plant-orthopteran co-occurrence network by using null models on species functional traits, phylogenetic relatedness and environmental conditions. We finally compared our results to abundance-based approaches. We found that the plant-orthopteran co-occurrence network had a modular organization. Community assembly rules differed among modules for plants while interactions with plants best explained the distribution of orthopterans into modules. Few species had a disproportionately high positive contribution to this modular organization and are likely to have a key importance to modulate future changes. The impact of agricultural practices was restricted to some modules (3 out of 5) suggesting that shifts in agricultural practices might not impact the entire plant-orthopteran co-occurrence network. These findings support our hypothesis that multiple assembly rules drive the modular structure of the plant-orthopteran network. This modular structure is likely to play a key role in the response of grassland ecosystems to future changes by limiting the impact of changes in agricultural practices such as intensification to some modules leaving species from other modules poorly impacted. The next step is to understand the importance of this modular structure for the long-term maintenance of grassland ecosystem structure and functions as well as to develop tools to integrate network structure into models to improve their capacity to predict future changes.",10.3389/fpls.2016.01224,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,0,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = habitat specificity, dispersal capacity, change in feeding regime, egg deposition preference, max height, Leaf dry matter content, seed mass, SLA.

"Fowler, MS; Ruokolainen, L",2013,"Colonization, covariance and colour: Environmental and ecological drivers of diversity-stability relationships",JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the relationship between community diversity and biomass stability is a fundamental topic in ecology. Theory has emphasized differences in species-specific responses to environmental fluctuations as an important stabiliser of total biomass fluctuations. However, previous analyses have often been based on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform species abundance distributions, uniform environmental variance across species, and uniform environmental responses across species pairs. We compare diversity-stability relationships in model communities, based on multi-species Ricker dynamics, that follow different colonization rules during community assembly (fixed or flexible resource use) forced by temporally uncorrelated (white) or correlated (red) environmental fluctuations. The colonization rules generate characteristic niche-dependent (hierarchical, HR) environmental covariance structures, which we compare with uncorrelated (independent, IR) species' environmental responses. Environmental reddening increases biomass stability and qualitatively alters diversity-stability patterns in HR communities, under both colonization rules. Diversity-stability patterns in IR communities are qualitatively altered by colonization rules but not by environmental colour. Our results demonstrate that diversity-stability patterns are contingent upon species' colonization strategies (resource use), emergent or independent responses to environmental fluctuations, and the colour of environmental fluctuations. We describe why our results arise through differences in species traits associated with niche position. These issues are often overlooked when considering the statistical components commonly used to describe diversity-stability patterns (e.g., Overyielding, Portfolio and Covariance effects). Mechanistic understanding of different diversity-stability relationships requires consideration of the biological processes that drive different population and community level behaviours.

Comparative phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium and Sorghum TCP proteins revealed two distinct classes categorized into ten subclades. Sub-clade F is dicot-specific, whereas A2, G1 and I1 groups only contained genes from grasses. Sub-clade B was missing in Sorghum, whereas group A1 was missing in rice indicating species-specific divergence of TCP proteins. TCP proteins of Sorghum are enriched in disorder promoting residues with class I containing higher percent disorder than class II proteins. Seven pairs of paralogous TCP genes were identified from Sorghum, five of which seem to predate Rice-Sorghum divergence. All of them have diverged in their expression.

"Francis, Clinton D.",2015,Vocal traits and diet explain avian sensitivities to anthropogenic noise,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Global population growth has caused extensive human-induced environmental change, including a near-ubiquitous transformation of the acoustical environment due to the propagation of anthropogenic noise. Because the acoustical environment is a critical ecological dimension for countless species to obtain, interpret and respond to environmental cues, highly novel environmental acoustics have the potential to negatively impact organisms that use acoustics for a variety of functions, such as communication and predator/prey detection. Using a comparative approach with 308 populations of 183 bird species from 14 locations in Europe, North American and the Caribbean, I sought to reveal the intrinsic and extrinsic factors responsible for avian sensitivities to anthropogenic noise as measured by their habitat use in noisy versus adjacent quiet locations. Birds across all locations tended to avoid noisy areas, but trait-specific differences emerged. Vocal frequency, diet and foraging location predicted patterns of habitat use in response to anthropogenic noise, but body size, nest placement and type, other vocal features and the type of anthropogenic noise (chronic industrial vs. intermittent urban/traffic noise) failed to explain variation in habitat use. Strongly supported models also indicated the relationship between sensitivity to noise and predictive traits had little to no phylogenetic structure. In general, traits associated with hearing were strong predictors - species with low-frequency vocalizations, which experience greater spectral overlap with low-frequency anthropogenic noise tend to avoid noisy areas, whereas species with higher frequency vocalizations respond less severely. Additionally, omnivorous species and those with animal-based diets were more sensitive to noise than birds with plant-based diets, likely because noise may interfere with the use of audition in multimodal prey detection. Collectively, these results suggest that anthropogenic noise is a powerful sensory pollutant that can filter avian communities nonrandomly by interfering with birds' abilities to receive, respond to and dispatch acoustic cues and signals.",10.1111/gcb.12862,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,1,"Traits = vocalization peak frequency, frequency range, duration, interval, diet, foraging location, nest type, nest location, ",
"FRANK, SA",1993,EVOLUTION OF HOST-PARASITE DIVERSITY,EVOLUTION,"Hosts and parasites often have extensive genetic diversity for resistance and virulence (host range). Qualitative diversity occurs when the success of attack is an all-or-nothing response that varies according to the genotypes of the host and parasite. Quantitative diversity occurs when the success of attack is a graded response that depends on additive genetic variation in the host and parasite. Community diversity occurs when parasites vary in the success with which they can attack different host species, leading to a mixture of specialists and generalists. I developed a series of models that classify components of host-parasite interactions according to whether they cause stabilizing or disruptive selection for resistance and virulence. Stabilizing selection reduces diversity by favoring a single optimal phenotype. Disruptive selection creates diversity by favoring a mixture of widely separated phenotypes. The evolution of maximal resistance and virulence are opposed by one of three forces: metabolic costs, frequency dependence, or negative genetic correlations among beneficial traits. The models predict that qualitatively inherited resistance and virulence traits typically cause greater diversity than quantitatively inherited traits. However, each natural system is composed of many stabilizing factors that reduce diversity and disruptive factors that promote diversity. I advocate a style of modeling in which families of related assumptions are compared by their equilibrium properties, and general conclusions from equilibrium properties are tested by complete dynamical analysis. The comparison among models highlights the need for empirical studies that compare levels of diversity among related host-parasite systems.",10.2307/2410216,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Franzen, D; Eriksson, O",2001,Small-scale patterns of species richness in Swedish semi-natural grasslands: the effects of community species pools,ECOGRAPHY,"Temperate semi-natural grasslands are known for their high plant species richness at small spatial scales. We examined the variation in small-scale species richness in a sample of 63 sites from Swedish semi-natural grasslands, located as fragments in the modem landscape dominated by forest and agricultural land. Data were obtained from two spatial scales at each site, 1 dm(2) and 4 m(2). Using an analysis based on a Monte Carlo simulation, we found support for the species-pool hypothesis: a high species richness at the 1 dm(2) scale was associated with high species richness at the 4 m(2) scale. The conclusion from this pattern analysis would, however, be considerably strengthened if we could reduce the likelihood that other mechanisms than sampling from species pools of unequal size influence the pattern of small-scale species richness. Additional analyses were made in order to identify such mechanisms. We examined whether four putative key traits: seed size, seed production, plant size and reproductive allocation were different among species at comparatively species-rich vs species-poor 1 dm(2) plots. We found only a little evidence for such differences. There was a weak tendency that species in the plots with high species richness possessed larger (and fewer) seeds than species from species-poor plots. Our results are congruent with the main prediction of the species pool model; variation in small-scale species richness (1 dm(2) scale) is basically a result of sampling from unequally sized community species pools (4 m(2) scale). Variation in species richness between the 4 m(2) sen-ii-natural grassland ""patches"" may thus be sought for among mechanisms operating at larger spatial scales than 4 m(2).

We extended the functional approach to a multitrophic system by combining plant and ant traits in relation to environmental conditions to study the relationships between these three components. We sampled plant and ant abundances along an aridity gradient in grazed and ungrazed conditions in the arid steppes of eastern Morocco. We measured five plant functional traits related to water stress and grazing resistance and six ant functional traits related to body size, dispersal and behaviour. We related each component (environment, vegetation and ants) using Mantel partial correlations to uncover the causal structure between components and using a fourth-corner analysis to describe the effects of the environment and vegetation on ant communities. Results indicated that vegetation had a direct effect on ant community composition while the environment only had an indirect effect on ant community composition through vegetation structure. This result was consistent when looking at both the taxonomic and functional composition of communities, but correlations were stronger when based on taxonomic composition. Aridity was the variable most significantly linked with ant functional traits Synthesis. The use of functional traits in animal ecology is relatively new, and an increase in trait-based community ecology studies that include more than one trophic level would be beneficial in identifying trait-based patterns in multitrophic communities.

We suggest that focusing on species' niches, rather than traits, may provide the predictive power needed to forecast biodiversity change. We first examine two Neotropical frog congeners with drastically different affinities to deforestation and document how thermal niche explains deforestation tolerance. The more deforestation-tolerant species is associated with warmer macroclimates across Costa Rica, and warmer microclimates within landscapes. Further, in laboratory experiments, the more deforestation-tolerant species has critical thermal limits, and a jumping performance optimum, shifted similar to 2 degrees C warmer than those of the more forest-affiliated species, corresponding to the similar to 3 degrees C difference in daytime maximum temperature that these species experience between habitats. Crucially, neither species strictly specializes on either habitat - instead habitat use is governed by regional environmental temperature. Both species track temperature along an elevational gradient, and shift their habitat use from cooler forest at lower elevations to warmer deforested pastures upslope. To generalize these conclusions, we expand our analysis to the entire mid-elevational herpetological community of southern Costa Rica. We assess the climatological affinities of 33 amphibian and reptile species, showing that across both taxonomic classes, thermal niche predicts presence in deforested habitat as well as or better than many commonly used traits.

With organisms being increasingly exposed to rapid environmental changes, there is growing interest in understanding individual phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in predation pressure. Behavioural and physiological responses to predator exposure are of particular interest as differences in predation pressure are often reflected in correlated suites of behavioural and hormonal profiles across populations. Within populations, the association between endocrine profiles and behaviour is less understood and often lacking. Adopting a reaction norm approach and a repeated measures design, we assessed within-population effects of changes in perceived predation risk on endocrinology and behaviour in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We repeatedly exposed subjects to a robotic model predator and assessed their behavioural response. The fish showed consistent behavioural profiles and were less active and shyer when predation risk was higher. Using non-invasive waterborne hormone analysis, we assessed basal cortisol as well as the cortisol response to changes in predation risk. Individuals showed significantly higher cortisol levels following exposure to the model predator. Individual post-predator exposure cortisol was repeatable but unrelated to behavioural responses. Accounting for between versus within-subject effects, we found that basal cortisol and shyness were positively related within individuals, that is individuals overall were shyer on days they had higher cortisol levels. We also tested if basal testosterone predicted risky behaviour and found no evidence for this hypothesis. No individual differences in hormonal or behavioural responses to changes in predation risk were found, suggesting that individuals are not constrained by their personalities in their ability to cope with a potentially harmful threat. Overall, we show that individuals of different personalities are equally flexible' in their response to changes in predation pressure. Our study offers novel insight into consistent individual differences and plasticity in hormones and behaviour as well as their interplay within populations. Future studies should assess the applicability of these findings to other changes in the environment, as well as the effects of social context on endocrine and behavioural reaction norms.",10.1111/1365-2435.12400,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Fuiman, Lee A.; Meekan, Mark G.; McCormick, Mark I.",2010,Maladaptive behavior reinforces a recruitment bottleneck in newly settled fishes,OECOLOGIA,"Settlement from the plankton ends the major dispersive stage of life for many marine organisms and exposes them to intense predation pressure in juvenile habitats. This predation mortality represents a life-history bottleneck that can determine recruitment success. At the level of individual predator-prey interactions, prey survival depends upon behavior, specifically how behavior affects prey conspicuousness and evasive ability. We conducted an experiment to identify behavioral traits and performance levels that are important determinants of which individuals survive or die soon after settlement. We measured a suite of behavioral traits on late stage, pre-settlement Ward's damsel (Pomacentrus wardi) collected using light traps. These behavioral traits included two measures of routine swimming (indicators of conspicuousness) and eight measures of escape performance to a visual startle stimulus. Fish were then released onto individual patch reefs, where divers measured an additional behavioral trait (boldness). We censused each patch reef until approximately 50% of the fish were missing (similar to 24 h), which we assumed to be a result of predation. We used classification tree analysis to discriminate survivors from fish presumed dead based on poor behavioral performance. The classification tree revealed that individuals displaying the maladaptive combination of low escape response speed, low boldness on the reef, and high routine swimming speed were highly susceptible to predation (92.4% with this combination died within 24 h). This accounted for 55.2% of all fish that died. Several combinations of behavioral traits predicted likely survival over 24 h, but there was greater uncertainty about that prediction than there was for fish that were predicted to die. Thus maladaptive behavioral traits were easier to identify than adaptive traits.",10.1007/s00442-010-1712-3,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Marine,Fish,Coral Reef,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = response latency, apparent distance, response distance, response duration, mean response speed, max response speed, time to max speed, max acceleration",
"Fukuda, S; De Baets, B",2016,Data prevalence matters when assessing species' responses using data-driven species distribution models,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,"The study of species' response is a key to understand the ecology of a species (e.g. critical habitat requirement and biological invasion processes) and design better conservation and management plans (e.g. problem identification, priority assessment and risk analysis). Predictive machine learning methods can be used as a tool for modeling species distributions as well as for describing important variables and specific habitat conditions required for a target species. This study aims (1) to demonstrate how habitat information such as species response curves can be retrieved from a species distribution model (SDM), (2) to assess the effects of data prevalence on model accuracy and habitat information retrieved from SDMs, and (3) to illustrate the differences between three data-driven methods, namely a fuzzy habitat suitability model (FHSM), random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVMs). Nineteen sets of virtual species data with different data prevalences were generated using field observed habitat conditions and hypothetical habitat suitability curves under four interaction scenarios governing the species-environment relationship for a virtual species. The effects of data prevalence on species distribution modeling were evaluated based on model accuracy and habitat information such as species response curves. Data prevalence affected both model accuracy and the assessment of species' response, with a stronger influence on the latter. The effects of data prevalence on model accuracy were less pronounced in the case of RF and SVMs which showed a higher performance. While the response curves were similar among the three models, data prevalence markedly affected the shapes of the response curves. Specifically, response curves obtained from a data set with higher prevalence showed higher tolerance to unsuitable habitat conditions, emphasizing the importance of accounting for data prevalence in the assessment of species-environment relationships. In a practical implementation of an SDM, data prevalence should be taken into account when interpreting the model results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such processes may act differentially on subsets of the community characterised by specific traits. To gain a deeper insight into these mechanisms, we supplemented a common method of studying metacommunities with an analysis of individual species and their traits. River floodplains are challenging environments for metacommunity analysis due to their spatial heterogeneity, temporal stochasticity and configurations of the networks of waterbodies. An analysis of aquatic gastropods showed that both environmental and spatial factors had significant influence. Within the spatial variables tested, the configuration of the floodplain network upstream of a sampling site was particularly important. An analysis of individual species revealed that traits related to niche breadth and drift propensity were significant for structuring the assemblages: species with a broad niche width (i.e. generalist, or neutral species) and a high drift propensity were governed more by the spatial configuration, whereas environmental conditions mainly determined the distribution of specialists having traits that prevented drift. These results can be interpreted as a trade-off between habitat specialisation and colonisation ability: specialists succeed locally due to competitiveness and a strategy of reducing risks by preventing drift, whereas generalists may succeed regionally due to a strategy of spreading risks, by high levels of reproductive output, dispersal rates and adaptability. Our findings have implications for schemes to restore river floodplains that affect the aquatic network, with subsequent effects on community assembly and thus on biodiversity.",10.1111/fwb.12228,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Other,River,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = gastropods.

Understanding and predicting ecological processes from species' traits has been considered a 'Holy Grail' in ecology. Plant functional traits are increasingly being used to develop mechanistic models that can predict how ecological communities will respond to abiotic and biotic perturbations and how species will affect ecosystem function and services in a rapidly changing world; however, significant challenges remain. In this review, we highlight recent work and outstanding questions in three areas: (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community-and ecosystem-level processes. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the characterization of plant strategies based on traits and trait relationships, and the integration of traits into multivariate indices and models of community and ecosystem function. However, the utility of trait-based approaches in ecology will benefit from efforts that demonstrate how these traits and indices influence organismal, community, and ecosystem processes across vegetation types, which may be achieved through meta-analysis and enhancement of trait databases. Additionally, intraspecific trait variation and species interactions need to be incorporated into predictive models using tools such as Bayesian hierarchical modelling.

Although this subject has attracted the interest of biologists and the general public, our scientific knowledge on the subject remains fragmentary. In the caterpillar of the swallowtail butterfly Papilio xuthus, spectacular changes in the color pattern are observed; the insect mimics bird droppings (mimetic pattern) as a young larva, and switches to a green camouflage coloration (cryptic pattern) in the final instar. Despite the wide variety and significance of larval color patterns, few studies have been conducted at a molecular level compared with the number of studies on adult butterfly wing patterns. Results: To obtain a catalog of genes involved in larval mimetic and cryptic pattern formation, we constructed expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries of larval epidermis for P. xuthus, and P. polytes that contained 20,736 and 5,376 clones, respectively, representing one of the largest collections available in butterflies. A comparison with silkworm epidermal EST information revealed the high expression of putative blue and yellow pigment-binding proteins in Papilio species. We also designed a microarray from the EST dataset information, analyzed more than five stages each for six markings, and confirmed spatial expression patterns by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Hence, we succeeded in elucidating many novel marking-specific genes for mimetic and cryptic pattern formation, including pigment-binding protein genes, the melanin-associated gene yellow-h3, the ecdysteroid synthesis enzyme gene 3-dehydroecdysone 3b-reductase, and Papilio-specific genes. We also found many cuticular protein genes with marking specificity that may be associated with the unique surface nanostructure of the markings. Furthermore, we identified two transcription factors, spalt and ecdysteroid signal-related E75, as genes expressed in larval eyespot markings. This finding suggests that E75 is a strong candidate mediator of the hormone-dependent coordination of larval pattern formation. Conclusions: This study is one of the most comprehensive molecular analyses of complicated morphological features, and it will serve as a new resource for studying insect mimetic and cryptic pattern formation in general. The wide variety of marking-associated genes (both regulatory and structural genes) identified by our screening indicates that a similar strategy will be effective for understanding other complex traits.",10.1186/1741-7007-10-46,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Here, we address the processes that have generated the spectacular diversity of flowering plants (> 300,000 species) and insect herbivores (likely > 1 million species). Long-standing macroevolutionary hypotheses have postulated that reciprocal evolution of adaptations and subsequent bursts of speciation have given rise to much of this biodiversity. We critically evaluate various predictions based on this coevolutionary theory. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states has revealed evidence for escalation in the potency or variety of plant lineages' chemical defenses; however, escalation of defense has been moderated by tradeoffs and alternative strategies (e. g., tolerance or defense by biotic agents). There is still surprisingly scant evidence that novel defense traits reduce herbivory and that such evolutionary novelty spurs diversification. Consistent with the coevolutionary hypothesis, there is some evidence that diversification of herbivores has lagged behind, but has nevertheless been temporally correlated with that of their host-plant clades, indicating colonization and radiation of insects on diversifying plants. However, there is still limited support for the role of host-plant shifts in insect diversification. Finally, a frontier area of research, and a general conclusion of our review, is that community ecology and the long-term evolutionary history of plant and insect diversification are inexorably intertwined.",10.1073/pnas.0904106106,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Intensive measures have been taken for crop protection against pests through the widespread use of chemical pesticides in order to reduce the loss of agriculture yield. Although crop protection practices have reduced the overall potential losses of 50 % to actual losses of about 30 %, crop losses due to pests still vary from 14 to 35 % according to the country. Moreover, consequences of this intensive agriculture are now well known with an important increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, water pollution and biodiversity loss. Current challenge is thus to design alternative sustainable cropping systems which maintain food production while reducing externalities. Application of ecological principles to agroecosystems has been proposed for that purpose. Nonetheless, it is difficult since crop systems are characterised by frequent and high disturbances, high nutrient input and high pressure of human activities. Here, we review the current knowledge in weed science and functional ecology and propose a conceptual framework to analyse weed community assembly in arable fields. Cropping systems are highly variable in their combination of agricultural techniques. We designed a trait-based approach of functional diversity (1) to establish a comparative description of the environmental gradients created by cropping systems and (2) to characterise the response of weeds to environmental gradients. We categorise the effects of cropping systems on the environment into disturbance and resource gradients. Disturbances induced by actual and previous agricultural practices are split into physical and chemical components, whose regime are defined by disturbance timing and frequency. Resource availability in arable fields is described by the value of effect traits of crops, such as plant height, that are related to their use of resources. Finally, we provide a list of relevant response traits of weeds to each component of the two gradients.",10.1007/s13593-013-0166-5,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = SLA, height growth rate, max plant height, seed mass, life form germination date, seed coat thickness, life form, flowering date, flowering range, leaf surface, plant phenology, ",

However, emergent genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence now challenges this role to be at best equivocal to other processess. Cnidaria are arguably the most ancient phylum of the extant metazoa that are venomous and such provide a definitive ancestral anchor to examine the evolution of this trait.Methods: Here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of the coral Acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts, to determine the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in this reef-building coral species. A new bioinformatics tool called HHCompare was developed to detect potential gene duplications in the genomic data, which is made freely available (https://github.com/rgacesa/HHCompare).Results: A total of 55 potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted from the A. digitifera genome, of which 36 (65 %) had likely arisen by gene duplication as evinced using the HHCompare tool and verified using two standard phylogeny methods. Surprisingly, only 22 % (12/55) of the potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous proteomic analysis, for which only half (6/12) of the toxin proteome could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates. Biological activities of these toxins are dominatedby putative phospholipases and toxic peptidases.Conclusions: Gene expansions in A. digitifera venom are the most extensive yet described in any venomous animal, and gene duplication plays a significant role leading to toxin diversification in this coral species. Since such low numbers of toxins were detected in the proteome, it is unlikely that the venom is evolving rapidly by prey-driven positive natural selection. Rather we contend that the venom has a defensive role deterring predation or harm from interspecific competition and overgrowth by fouling organisms. Factors influencing translation of toxin encoding genes perhaps warrants more profound experimental consideration.",10.1186/s12864-015-1976-4,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Gallagher, RV; Leishman, MR",2012,Contrasting patterns of trait-based community assembly in lianas and trees from temperate Australia,OIKOS,"Trait variation in plant communities is thought to be constrained by two opposing community assembly processes operating at discrete spatial scales: habitat filtering and limiting similarity between coexisting species. Filtering processes cause convergence in ecological strategy as species are excluded from unsuitable sites, whilst limiting similarity leads to the divergence of trait values between co-occurring species in order to alleviate competition for finite resources. Levels of alpha (within-site) and beta (among-site) trait variation can be indicative of the strength of these community assembly processes. We used trait-gradient analysis to explicitly compare evidence of community assembly patterns in lianas (woody vines) and trees. These two growth forms exhibit striking differences in carbon capture and regeneration strategies, yet trait-based mechanisms that maintain their coexistence remain understudied. Using data for four functional traits leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen content (Nmass), leaf area and seed mass we partitioned interspecific trait variation in lianas and trees into alpha and beta components. Our three key findings were: 1) lianas and trees exhibit divergent patterns of trait-based habitat filtering, due to differences in the relationship between leaf size and the other three traits examined (LMA, Nmass and seed mass), 2) on average, liana species possess smaller seeds, lower LMA and higher Nmass than do trees, but there was no clear difference in leaf area between the two growth forms, and 3) soil fertility was correlated with trait variation (leaf area, seed mass) at the site-level in trees, but not in lianas. These results provide evidence that dominant growth forms can be filtered into the same habitat on the basis of different combinations of traits. Our findings have important implications for community assembly and co-existence theory and for more pragmatic matters such as using trait-based principles to inform community restoration.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20025.x,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,0,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,,"Traits = leaf mass per area, leaf N content, leaf area, seed mass.

Approaches analyzing the functional (or phylogenetic) similarity between invasive species and native communities are increasingly employed to infer the processes underlying successful invasions and to predict future invaders. The relatively simple conceptual foundations have made these approaches very appealing and therefore widely used, often leading to confusion and hampering generalizations. We undertook a comprehensive review and synthesis of the functional similarity approach in invasion community ecology to clarify its advantages and limitations, to summarize what has been learned thus far, and to suggest avenues for future improvement. We first present the methodological state of the art and provide general guidelines. Second, by organizing the published literature around seven key questions in invasion ecology we found cumulative evidence that: at large spatial scales phylogenetic relatedness of invasive and native species is a good predictor of invasion success, but a poor predictor of invasion impacts; at fine spatial scales, community resistance to invasion tends to increase with native species diversity and with similarity to the invaders, consistent with patterns emerging from biotic interactions. In general, the processes filtering invaders appear to vary across species' invasion stage and along environmental gradients. Nonetheless, we found conflicting evidence for differences in community assembly processes between invasive and native species, and between the invader's native and adventive ranges. Finally, we propose four important avenues for overcoming some of the identified methodological and conceptual limitations of the approach, in particular by integrating observational and experimental analyses and by explicitly considering species' demographic rates and complex biotic interactions. Although the functional similarity approach bears intrinsic limitations, it still offers many opportunities in invasion community ecology at large spatial scales.",10.1111/ecog.02446,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,,

This often yields intense competition among larvae that are sharing the same host. Why would a female oviposit in such hostile habitat instead of looking for a better quality, unparasitized host? Here we present a continuous-time model of host-parasitoid interaction and discuss alternative scenarios. This model is first used to analyze the evolution of the superparasitism behavior of a solitary proovigenic parasitoid under both time and egg limitation. Then, following the recent discovery by Varaldi et al., we allow the parasitoid to be infected by a virus that alters the superparasitism behavior of its host to enhance its own horizontal transmission. The analysis of the coevolution of this manipulative behavior with the oviposition behavior of uninfected females clarifies and quantifies the conflict that emerges between the parasitoid and its virus. The model also yields new testable predictions. For example, we expect that uninfected parasitoids should superparasite less after coevolving with the manipulative virus. More generally, this model provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the evolution of the manipulation of parasitoid life-history traits by microparasites.",10.1086/498398,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Using a comparative approach, we investigated the relationship between eye size and brain size, and the effect of prey capture technique and nocturnality on these traits. After controlling for allometric effects, there was a significant, positive correlation between relative brain size and relative eye size. Variation in relative eye and brain size were significantly and positively related to prey capture technique and nocturnality when a potentially confounding variable, aquatic feeding, was controlled statistically in multiple regression of independent linear contrasts. Applying a less robust, brunching approach, these patterns also emerged, with the exception that relative brain size did not vary with prey capture technique.

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance.

Various theoretical models have used the size distribution of plankton communities to explain their trophic structure and functioning. Recent studies indicate that changes associated with global warming, eutrophication, and fisheries might have dramatically shifted the size structure of marine organisms and thus changed ecosystem functioning. Accordingly, size structure has been suggested as a useful indicator for monitoring ecosystem status. Here, we used three size metrics to represent mesozooplankton size structure: the slope of normalized biomass spectra (NB-SS), NB-SS linear fit, and size diversity. We analyzed the relationship between zooplankton size structure and environmental conditions in the very dynamic East China Sea (ECS). We tested four hypotheses predicted by theoretical studies: (1) a coastal-offshore gradient for NB-SS, (2) a negative relationship between temperature and NB-SS steepness, (3) a positive relationship between trophic status (i.e., chlorophyll a and inorganic-nutrient concentrations as a proxy) and NB-SS steepness, and (4) a positive relationship between oligotrophy and NB-SS linearity. Hypotheses 1-3 did not stand up to our analyses of the empirical data, while hypothesis 4 was supported. In the ECS, we found no clear spatial gradient for each of the three size metrics, where (i) size diversity was not correlated to temperature and significantly decreased with chl a and phosphate concentrations, (ii) the NB-SS slope showed no relationship with the environment, and (iii) NB-SS linearity tended to be higher in more oligotrophic offshore waters. Trophic status exerted a stronger effect than temperature on size distribution, but its effect was opposite to model prediction. Our results suggest that population dynamics (i.e., pulses of reproduction due to increased food availability) override metabolic scaling effects on mesozooplankton NB-SS at the mesoscale. In addition, the estimation of NB-SS slopes depends on NB-SS linearity and may therefore be less accurate than size diversity as a synthetic indicator of NB-SS changes. Our results highlight the need for caution when using size-based indicators for monitoring environmental forcing on communities in highly dynamic ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Garcia-Feced, C; Saura, S; Elena-Rossello, R",2011,Improving landscape connectivity in forest districts: A two-stage process for prioritizing agricultural patches for reforestation,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Connectivity is a key concern in natural resource planning. Many studies have focused on the development of methods, tools and indices for the assessment of both components of connectivity: structural and functional. In particular, approaches based on graph theory principles have been recently proposed and are being increasingly applied to guide landscape connectivity conservation. However, forest planners and managers still need effective and operational methodologies to detect those landscapes where connectivity should be treated as a particularly critical conservation concern. In addition, in the Mediterranean, as in other parts of the world, socioeconomic changes in the last decades have driven the abandonment of many formerly cultivated lands. This poses both a challenge and an opportunity for managers intending to restore ecological connectivity in forested areas. In this context, setting adequate priorities for the reforestation of agricultural lands is of outmost importance. Here we show how a two-stage hierarchical methodology based on network analysis can be used to meet these needs. In particular, we apply a graph metric based on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale (the Integral Index of Connectivity) to two Mediterranean forest districts in Spain with different management objectives and environmental heterogeneity. First, we identify those landscapes where efforts to improve forest connectivity should be concentrated. In a second stage, we prioritize within those landscapes the individual patches of agricultural lands that, being available for a potential reforestation program, would contribute most to uphold connectivity and ecological flows at wide spatial scales. We show how the extent of the agricultural patches is not strictly related to the contribution to connectivity they would provide if reforested, and how the results of such analysis vary with species traits (dispersal capabilities). We discuss the suitability of the proposed approach for forest landscape planning purposes and conclude that it can provide a useful diagnosis and helpful guidelines for the development of efficient reforestation programs that might be applied in a variety of situations for improving the ecological coherence of forest landscapes.

Here we set out to test for the role of dispersal limitation, species sorting and shared effects in the assembly of pond macrophyte metacommunities across an extensive area within the Iberian Plateau, and to identify which traits, environmental variables and spatial scales are driving local community structure. Location North-western Spain (Iberian Plateau). Taxon Pond macrophytes. Methods We established a novel combination of robust methods capable of identifying the processes and most important landscape scales involved in the assembly of communities. We used metacommunity assembly modelling and multivariate multi-scale codependence analysis (mMCA) to first estimate the relative importance of spatial and environmental effects on community structure, and then to identify significant trait-environment relationships and spatial scales. Results Analyses showed that the greatest effects were seen for the spatial and mixed spatial and niche-based scenarios, particularly among wind-dispersed species. Thus, dispersal limitation interfered with species sorting in determining assemblage structure by hindering species' tracking of local environmental conditions. After accounting for this, the metacommunity assembly model revealed that species' traits were involved in determining abundance structure. mMCA identified the main trait-environment relationships (and spatial scales) as fruit size-nutrient status (similar to 300 km) and growth form-mean pond depth (similar to 250 km). Main conclusions Our study suggests that dispersal limitation acted in concert with species sorting to influence the community assembly processes underlying selection for particular traits in functional niche space. Accordingly, we emphasize the need to go beyond the traditional taxonomic-based analyses of community composition and the predominant thinking of considering spatial and environmental processes as two alternative and mutually exclusive scenarios of community assembly.",10.1111/jbi.13516,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Freshwater,Plants,Ponds,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,0,1,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,1,1,1,"Traits = growth form, mode of reproduction, # of reproductive organs per year and individual, perennation, dispersal factor, period of production of reproductive organ, fruit size.

Our objectives were to assess the spatial variation in folivory on Nothofagus pumilio and understand the influence of climate on folivory patterns as mediated by changes in folivore density and leaf traits. Location Nothofagus pumilio forests, between 38 and 55 degrees S (Argentina). Methods We studied the correlation of leaf damage with latitude on data from 47 sampling sites, and evaluated spatial patterns of autocorrelation on latitudinally detrended data with a principal coordinates of neighbour matrices method. Path analysis was used to test the association of temperature and precipitation with leaf damage, mediated by folivore density and leaf traits. We evaluated the adequacy of this ecological model by examining the spatial pattern of autocorrelation in the residuals, and combined spatial and environmental predictors of leaf damage into partial regression. Results Leaf damage decreased with latitude, which was the only significant spatial predictor. The latitudinal decrease in temperature and precipitation was correlated with a decrease in the density of folivores and leaf size, and diminished leaf damage. Our ecological model adequately explained the spatial autocorrelation in the data: 44% of the variation in leaf damage was explained by the latitudinally structured component of the environment, whereas local environmental effects accounted for another 22%. Main conclusions We conclude that N. pumilio forests show consistent latitudinal patterns of variation in folivory, folivore density and leaf traits. Our study suggests that the latitudinal variation in folivory rates is partly driven by the influence of climate on both plants and herbivores. This warns us about the potential susceptibility of folivory rates to climate warming.

Understanding how functional traits, which are key for plant functioning, relate to demographic parameters of populations is central to tackle pending issues in plant ecology such as the forecast of the fate of populations and communities in a changing world, the quantification of community assembly processes or the improvement of species distribution models. We addressed this question in the case of species from a Mediterranean rangeland of southern France.2. Changes in species abundance in response to management intensification (fertilization and increased grazing pressure) were followed over a 28-year period. Probabilities of presence, and elasticities of the changes in the probability of space occupancy to colonization and survival, which are analogues of demographic parameters, were calculated for 53 species from the time series of abundance data using a space occupancy model. Nine quantitative traits pertaining to resource use, plant morphology, regeneration and phenology were measured on these species and related to demographic parameters.3. The long-term dynamics of species in response to management intensification was associated with major changes in functional traits and strategies. Changes in the probability of occurrence-analogous to population growth rate-were correlated with traits describing the fast-slow continuum of leaf functioning. The elasticity of population growth rate to colonization was significantly related to reproductive plant height and seed mass, and to a lower extent, to leaf carbon isotopic ratio.4. Synthesis. The functional response of species to management intensification corresponds to a shift along the second axis of a recently identified global spectrum of plant form and function, which maps, to some extent, onto the fast-slow continuum of life-history strategies. By contrast, the elasticity of colonization relates to the global spectrum axis capturing the size of organs. Seed mass contributes to this axis and is assumed to relate to one of the important traits structuring the reproductive strategy axis of life histories as well, namely net reproductive rate. While this mapping between functional and life-history traits is appealing, further tests in contrasting types of communities are required to assess its degree of generality.",10.1111/1365-2745.12996,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,1,,,0,E,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"Traits = leaf area, SLA, leaf dry matter content, mass-based leaf nitrogen content, mass based P content, leaf carbon isotopic discrimination, life cycle, life form.

This leads to the prediction that these traits should show stronger condition dependence and larger genetic variance than other traits subject to weaker or stabilizing selection. While empirical evidence of condition dependence in postcopulatory traits is increasing, the comparison between sexually selected and control' traits is often based on untested assumption concerning the different strength of selection acting on these traits. Furthermore, information on selection in the past is essential, as both condition dependence and genetic variance of a trait are likely to be influenced by the pattern of selection acting historically on it. Using the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a livebearing fish with high levels of multiple paternity, we performed three independent experiments on three ejaculate quality traits, sperm number, velocity, and size, which have been previously shown to be subject to strong, intermediate, and weak directional postcopulatory selection, respectively. First, we conducted an inbreeding experiment to determine the pattern of selection in the past. Second, we used a diet restriction experiment to estimate their level of condition dependence. Third, we used a half-sib/full-sib mating design to estimate the coefficients of additive genetic variance (CVA) underlying these traits. Additionally, using a simulated predator evasion test, we showed that both inbreeding and diet restriction significantly reduced condition. According to predictions, sperm number showed higher inbreeding depression, stronger condition dependence, and larger CVA than sperm velocity and sperm size. The lack of significant genetic correlation between sperm number and velocity suggests that the former may respond to selection independently one from other ejaculate quality traits. Finally, the association between sperm number and condition suggests that this trait may mediate the genetic benefits of polyandry which have been shown in this species.",10.1002/ece3.870,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Different ecological mechanisms occur individually in an overlapping manner, so the structure of each local community is influenced by an independent mixture of these factors. To identify which of these factors prevails in organizing the species-rich tree community from 100 plots of 10 x 10 m in a primary forest patch (the Forest of Seu Nico - FSN, from the Atlantic Forest domain), we analyzed species-environment correlations via canonical correspondence analysis and identified two different pedo-environments. We analyzed the community's phylogenetic structure using Phylocom 4.2 software to calculate the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Furthermore, we partitioned the total phylogenetic diversity into independent alpha and beta components (I (ST)). To reveal the overlap of ecological mechanisms such as neutrality, environmental filtering and density-dependent factors, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure in both pedo-environments. The species-environment correlations observed in the FSN are weak in comparison with those found in other studies, although the permanent plot presents a short environmental gradient, dividing the plot into an upper, more acidic hillside and a lower, more fertile bottom. The overall phylogenetic structure of the FSN community shows strong and significant phylogenetic overdispersion. This overdispersion indicates that density-dependent factors, such as interspecific competition, play an important role in maintaining the species richness and community structure in megadiverse ecosystems such as the FSN when we assume traits to be conserved within evolutionary lineages. The NRI and NTI are correlated positively with the soil pH and negatively with the soil's aluminum concentration, so the bottom plots show higher phylogenetic overdispersion and lower I (ST) values than the hillside plots. This pattern can be explained by the greater importance of environmental filters in more acidic soils that form less favorable habitats, while the influence of competition and therefore also the rate of competitive exclusion are higher in the more favorable, less acidic plots.",10.1007/s12224-013-9181-1,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Grasslands and woodlands are constrained at the opposite poles of these gradients, with grasslands occurring in areas with poorer soils and higher levels of both water-stress and fire intensity. According to the stress-dominance hypothesis, one might expect the importance of competition for community assembly to increase from grasslands to woodlands. Assuming conservation of ecological niches within evolutionary lineages, this should increase phylogenetic overdispersion from grasslands towards woodlands. To test this, we calculated phylogenetic diversity and community structure using different null models as well as the phylogenetic signal of life form as a proxy of niche space. All indices indicate phylogenetic clustering for grasslands and phylogenetic overdispersion for woodlands. Considering that most life-forms showed a significant phylogenetic signal, findings indicate that competition and further density dependent factors may play a larger role in community assembly of physiognomies in less harsh positions along the gradient, while environmental filtering dominates the harsher positions. Our results indicate that the entire gradient should receive conservation priority in order to guarantee the effective conservation of this endangered ecosystem, including its species richness and ecological processes such as community assembly.",10.1590/0102-33062016abb0442,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Underlying factors are not well understood, but insights towards different biological traits are suggested, in particular trophic specialisation, leading to different responses to environmental conditions. Based on most striking differences in biological and life history traits, i.e. size, spawning'and feeding, we calibrated a bioenergetics model, based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory, for Engraulis encrasicolus and Sardina pilchardus in the Bay of Biscay. Starting from the anchovy model, differences in traits were successively integrated to build the sardine model through a novel exploratory approach by scenarios. We used a robust method for parameter estimation, the Evolution Strategies, with a large dataset of length and mass at age, as well as energy density, which is the first time in such a model calibration. Energy density data proved to be particularly well suited to assess the quality of DEB model predictions and parameter set estimates. Insights in respective physiology were drawn from analysis of parameter values and predictions of the model. We showed that anchovy and sardine have distinct strategies with respect to energy acquisition and especially to allocation to spawning. Anchovy are characterised by higher metabolic rates and requirements. This species is more likely to benefit from periods of high food availability to carry out both growth, spawning and reserve storage. Sardine have less demanding food requirements and metabolic costs. Sardine take advantage of larger reserves storage capacity to decouple spawning and prey blooms and to lengthen spawning period, and thus display a more capital breeding spawning behaviour. Overall, our model outputs distinguish between anchovy that tend towards an almost ""all or nothing"" energetic strategy, and sardine that tend to carry out lower metabolic activities but on a more regular basis. This first modelling demonstration of a bioenergetics difference between these two species, and the explanation it brings in the understanding of their respective reproduction strategies, opens new perspectives in the interpretation of their differential responses at the population scale to environment variability.

Here we expanded our investigation to 51 species, representing 96% of individual plants recorded over 30 years, and analysed trait relationships in the context of species abundance and phylogenetic relationships.

However, assessing the extent of climate impacts on species and their life-history traits requires reliable quantitative statistical approaches. We used a new analytical tool in markrecapture, the multi-event modelling, to simultaneously assess the influence of climatic variation on multiple demographic parameters (i.e. adult survival, transient probability, reproductive skipping and nest dispersal) at two Mediterranean colonies of the Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea, a trans-equatorial migratory long-lived seabird. We also analysed the impact of climate in the breeding success at the two colonies. We found a clear temporal variation of survival for Cory's shearwaters, strongly associated to the large-scale SOI especially in one of the colonies (up to 66% of variance explained). Atlantic hurricane season is modulated by the SOI and coincides with shearwater migration to their wintering areas, directly affecting survival probabilities. However, the SOI was a better predictor of survival probabilities than the frequency of hurricanes; thus, we cannot discard an indirect additive effect of SOI via food availability. Accordingly, the proportion of transients was also correlated with SOI values, indicating higher costs of first reproduction (resulting in either mortality or permanent dispersal) when bad environmental conditions occurred during winter before reproduction. Breeding success was also affected by climatic factors, the NAO explaining c. 41% of variance, probably as a result of its effect in the timing of peak abundance of squid and small pelagics, the main prey for shearwaters. No climatic effect was found either on reproductive skipping or on nest dispersal. Contrarily to what we expect for a long-lived organism, large-scale climatic indexes had a more pronounced effect on survival and transient probabilities than on less sensitive fitness parameters such reproductive skipping or nest dispersal probabilities. The potential increase in hurricane frequency because of global warming may interact with other global change agents (such as incidental bycatch and predation by alien species) nowadays impacting shearwaters, affecting future viability of populations.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02015.x,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Obeservationa/Q Model,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,1,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = adult survival, transient probability, reproductive skipping, nest dispersal.

We look at the effects of clear-cut forest harvesting and subsequent wood ash application on the free-living nematode community using trait-based indices and body size spectra. We test the hypothesis that body size is a unifying trait and that the body size spectra can be used to demonstrate changes in soil quality while overcoming taxonomic impediments. Undisturbed boreal forest floor soils were compared with clear-cut sites amended with zero, one-half calcium equivalent wood ash, equivalent calcium reintroduction, and twice calcium reintroduction. Total abundance, trait-based metrics for the Maturity Index, and two metrics of body size spectra were calculated. Nematode abundance was not a good indicator of soil disturbance, while traditional trait-based approaches (the summed Maturity Index) demonstrated predicted changes in community structure. Analysis of two types of body size spectra elucidated how the community had changed under disturbance, and revealed that smaller bodied organisms were lost under ash amended treatments compared to both clear-cut and undisturbed forest. Using the body size spectra for nematodes is a simple addition to current trait-based approaches that can supplement soil assessments for disturbance and quality without requiring taxonomic expertise.

Both sequential and whole-otolith SIAs were performed on six fish species of Lake Annecy and their results compared to muscle SIA. The first purpose of these investigations was to test the use of delta O-18(oto) values for reconstructing fish thermal history and delimiting spatial distribution in a stratified lake. Comparison of species-specific fractionation equations and the general equation developed for freshwater fishes showed that the general one was the best suited for thermal estimation of Lake Annecy fishes and suggested that inter-specific differences or specific ""vital effects"" are not the only reason for apparent difference in fractionation. Thermal estimations based on SIA were consistent with descriptions of thermal habitats in the literature, except in the case of roach (Rutilus rutilus). Based on the current results, roach appears to live in a colder habitat than do perch (Perca fluviatilis). The high water transparency and thermal stratification of Lake Annecy could explain this distribution. Moreover, perch juveniles were found to live in two different thermal niches. This finding highlights the great plasticity of the species. Second, the potential use of delta C-13(oto) values to reconstruct variation in diet and metabolism was assessed. The proportion of metabolic carbon (M) contributing to otolith carbon varies markedly among species. Comparison with delta C-13(muscle) values shows no direct relationship between delta C-13(oto) and diet at either the intra-individual or the inter-specific level. A strong linear relationship between either M or the isotopic offset between otolith and muscle (Delta delta C-13(oto-muscle)) and delta O-18(oto) values was found; this relationship reveals the dependence of M on the ambient temperature at which the species occurs.

Reproduction strategies play an important role in biological invasion processes and help to predict future population development. Up to now, studies on the reproductive traits of the three species have led to contradictory findings in invaded areas, and studies on native populations are scarce, especially when regarding a co-occurrence of the three species. This study provides an overview over already existing knowledge of reproductive traits in native as well as invaded regions and describes the reproduction modes of all three species at the Lower Rhine. Based on intensive beach seine sampling in nursery habitats for three consecutive years, detailed information about the spawning habits of the bighead goby Ponticola kessleri, the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, and the monkey goby N. fluviatilis is provided. Spawning onset as well as length and intensity of the spawning season were determined by estimating growth rates and subsequent back-calculations of hatching and spawning events. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) analyses of adult gobies were used to cross-validate results and to assess validity of the used method. Growth rates for the first three months of all three species were highly variable and ranged between 0.3 mm and 0.95 mm total length per day. All three Gobiidae displayed different reproductive modes with bighead gobies spawning first in March/April, but probably only once a season. In contrast, round and monkey gobies started reproducing slightly later, but then continued spawning throughout the season until September, exhibiting temporal separation with varying intensities. High variation in spawning onset, length and reproductive output for all three species was observed over the years and no relationship between spawning onset and temperature could be detected.

Understanding the role of predation in shaping the dynamics of animal communities is a fundamental issue in ecological research. Nevertheless, the complex nature of predatorprey interactions often prevents researchers from modelling them explicitly. 2. By using periodic Leslie-Usher matrices and a simulation approach together with parameters obtained from long-term field projects, we reconstructed the underlying mechanisms of predator-prey demographic interactions and compared the dynamics of the roe deer-red fox-Eurasian lynx-human harvest system with those of the moose-brown bear-gray wolf-human harvest system in the boreal forest ecosystem of the southern Scandinavian Peninsula. 3. The functional relationship of both roe deer and moose lambda to changes in predation rates from the four predators was remarkably different. Lynx had the strongest impact among the four predators, whereas predation rates by wolves, red foxes, or brown bears generated minor variations in prey population lambda. Elasticity values of lynx, wolf, fox and bear predation rates were -0 157, -0 056, -0 031 and -0 006, respectively, but varied with both predator and prey densities. 4. Differences in predation impact were only partially related to differences in kill or predation rates, but were rather a result of different distribution of predation events among prey age classes. Therefore, the age composition of killed individuals emerged as the main underlying factor determining the overall per capita impact of predation. 5. Our results confirm the complex nature of predator-prey interactions in large terrestrial mammals, by showing that different carnivores preying on the same prey species can exert a dramatically different demographic impact, even in the same ecological context, as a direct consequence of their predation patterns. Similar applications of this analytical framework in other geographical and ecological contexts are needed, but a more general evaluation of the subject is also required, aimed to assess, on a broader systematic and ecological range, what specific traits of a carnivore are most related to its potential impact on prey species.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01928.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,didn't actually use traits,

Most traits are plastic, but the degree to which plasticity is adaptive or non-adaptive depends on whether environmentally induced phenotypes are closer or further away from the local optimum(2-4). Existing theories make conflicting predictions about whether plasticity constrains or facilitates adaptive evolution(4-12). Debate persists because few empirical studies have tested the relationship between initial plasticity and subsequent adaptive evolution in natural populations. Here we show that the direction of plasticity in gene expression is generally opposite to the direction of adaptive evolution. We experimentally transplanted Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) adapted to living with cichlid predators to cichlid-free streams, and tested for evolutionary divergence in brain gene expression patterns after three to four generations. We find 135 transcripts that evolved parallel changes in expression within the replicated introduction populations. These changes are in the same direction exhibited in a native cichlid-free population, suggesting rapid adaptive evolution. We find 89% of these transcripts exhibited non-adaptive plastic changes in expression when the source population was reared in the absence of predators, as they are in the opposite direction to the evolved changes. By contrast, the remaining transcripts exhibiting adaptive plasticity show reduced population divergence. Furthermore, the most plastic transcripts in the source population evolved reduced plasticity in the introduction populations, suggesting strong selection against non-adaptive plasticity. These results support models predicting that adaptive plasticity constrains evolution(6-8), whereas non-adaptive plasticity potentiates evolution by increasing the strength of directional selection(11,12). The role of non-adaptive plasticity in evolution has received relatively little attention; however, our results suggest that it may be an important mechanism that predicts evolutionary responses to new environments.",10.1038/nature15256,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Past studies have focused on a limited number of communities at local or regional scales, thus precluding a comprehensive examination of assembly rules. We addressed this challenge by examining stream fish community assembly within numerous independent watersheds spanning a broad environmental gradient. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) are fish communities structured non-randomly, and (2) what is the relative importance of environmental filtering, predator-prey interactions and interspecific competition in driving species associations? LocationThe conterminous USA. MethodsWe used null models to analyse species associations in streams. Non-random communities were defined as those where the summed number of segregated and aggregated species pairs exceeded the number expected by chance. We used species traits to characterize species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV), identify potential predator-prey interactions (PRED) and estimate likely degree of competition based on species similarity in body size, feeding strategies and phylogeny (COMP). To evaluate the effect of environmental filtering, predation and competition on species associations, we related ENV, PRED and COMP to the degree of species segregation. ResultsThe majority (75-85%) of watersheds had non-random fish communities. Species segregation increased with species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV). An increase in competition strength (COMP) did not appear to increase segregation. Species pairs engaging in predator-prey interactions (PRED) were more segregated than non-predator-prey pairs. ENV was more predictive of the degree of species segregation than PRED. Main conclusionsWe provide compelling evidence for widespread non-random structure in US stream fish communities.

Current investigations focus mainly on larval dispersal from an evolutionary and a biogeographic perspective, taking into account also population connectivity, conservation planning and coastal management. In the present paper we underline the need to improve knowledge of the main traits of marine invertebrate life cycles, highlighting the limits and challenges of current approaches. Firstly, we summarized the changing approaches within community studies, following the paradigm shifts found in recent marine ecological research, from supply-side ecology to connectivity, and involving the concepts of open and closed populations. Secondly, we analysed the main larval traits influencing dispersal, paying particular attention to pelagic larval duration in light of the few available data for connectivity studies. The difficulty in estimating many of the main traits of larval ecology make numerical simulation fundamental for a better understanding of the relationship between propagule dispersal and seawater dynamics, both being highly variable. We conclude that some essential biological information is still lacking for the proper integration of the modeling approaches.

Niche theory postulates that phenotypes determine species distribution across environmental gradients, leading to a phylogenetic signature in the community assembly. Thus, the incorporation of species phylogeny in the analysis of community ecology structure allows one to link broader environmental, spatial and temporal factors to local, small-scale ecological processes, thus enabling understanding of community assembly patterns in a broader context. We used the net relatedness index to assess phylogenetic structure within avian communities across a harshness gradient in coastal habitats in southern Brazil. We also evaluated phylogenetic beta diversity, to test whether closely related species exploit habitats with similar environmental conditions. In order to do so, we scaled up phylogenetic information from the species to site level using phylogenetic fuzzy weighting. We found a pattern of phylogenetic clustering in less-vegetated habitats, namely sandy beach and dunes, which are subject to harsher conditions because of proximity to the ocean. Basal lineages were associated with the more structurally homogeneous sandy beach, while late-divergence clades occurred in more complex habitats, which were positively related to vegetation cover and height. The observed pattern of phylogenetic clustering suggested the importance of harsh conditions in constraining the distribution of avian lineages. Furthermore, contrasting environmental features between habitats influenced phylogenetic variation, demonstrating the prevalence of phylogenetic habitat filtering. From an applied point of view, such as planning and management of biological reserves, we showed that the full array of habitat patches embedded within coastal ecological gradients must be included in order to preserve distinct evolutionary lineages.",10.1111/aec.12042,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Yet, it is not well known whether and how urbanization influences other facets of biodiversity, such as the functional and evolutionary composition of communities, and at what spatial scale urbanization acts. Here we used a hierarchical sampling design in which urbanization levels were quantified at seven spatial scales (ranging from 50 to 3200 m radii). We found that urbanization gradients are associated with a strong shift in cladoceran zooplankton species traits, which in turn affected phylogenetic composition of the entire metacommunity, but only when considering urbanization at the smallest spatial scale (50 m radius). Specifically, small cladoceran species dominated in more urbanized ponds whereas large-bodied, strong competitors prevailed in less urbanized systems. We also show that trait and phylogenetic metrics strongly increase the amount of variation in beta-diversity that can be explained by degree of urbanization, environmental and spatial factors. This suggests that the mechanisms shaping beta-diversity in our study system are mediated by traits and phylogenetic relatedness rather than species identities. Our study indicates that accounting for traits and phylogeny in metacommunity analyses helps to explain seemingly idiosyncratic patterns of variation in zooplankton species composition along urbanization gradients. The fact that urbanization acts only at the smallest spatial scale suggests that correctly managing environmental conditions locally has the power to counteract the effects of urbanization on biodiversity patterns. The multidimensional approach we applied here can be applied to other systems and organism groups and seems to be key in understanding how overall biodiversity changes in response to anthropogenic pressures and how this scales up to affect ecosystem functioning.",10.1111/ecog.02926,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Plankton,Ponds,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"Taxonomic = cladoceran zooplankton.

This is particularly true for terrestrial arthropods, of which only 20 % are described. Using epigaeic ant assemblages, we asked: (1) can we use morphological variation among species to predict trophic position or preferred microhabitat; (2) does the strength of morphological associations suggest recent trait divergence; (3) do environmental variables at site scale predict trait sets for whole assemblages? We pitfall-trapped ants from a revegetation chronosequence and measured their morphology, trophic position [using C:N stoichiometry and stable isotope ratios (delta)] and characteristics of microhabitat and macrohabitat. We found strong associations between high trophic position (low C:N and high delta N-15) in body tissue and morphological traits: predators were larger, had more laterally positioned eyes, more physical protection and tended to be monomorphic. In addition, morphological traits were associated with certain microhabitat features, e.g. smaller heads were associated with the bare ground microhabitat. Trait-microhabitat relationships were more pronounced when phylogenetic adjustments were used, indicating a strong influence of recent trait divergences. At the assemblage level, our fourth corner analysis revealed associations between the prevalence of traits and macrohabitat, although these associations were not the same as those based on microhabitat associations. This study shows direct links between species-level traits and both diet and habitat preference. Trait-based prediction of ecological roles and community structure is thus achievable when integrating stoichiometry, morphology and phylogeny, but scale is an important consideration in such predictions.",10.1007/s00442-014-3101-9,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Insects,"Grassland, ",0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,1,T,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = weber's length (body size), femur length, head width, mandible length, eye width, eye position, scape length, sculturing, spinosity, pilosity, polymorphism, C:N ratio (trophic position).

This parasitic plant is also able to complete its life cycle on many Brassicaceae weeds, which are thus important alternative hosts. We studied a set of 14 common Brassicaceae weeds and characterised their ability to induce the germination of three genetically distinct pathovars of P.ramosa, based on invitro experiments. We then investigated whether phylogenetic relatedness among Brassicaceae weeds could inform on their ability to induce germination of P.ramosa by testing for a phylogenetic signal in the germination rate of the parasite. In the presence of some phylogenetic signal, phylogenetic distances among species might be used as a surrogate to predict the ability to induce germination of potential additional Brassicaceae hosts. The three pathovars studied showed different germination patterns. Moreover, we found substantial variation in the germination rate of P.ramosa among the different Brassicaceae species, with a significant effect of the clustering of species into two ancient phylogenetic lineages. However, no significant phylogenetic signal was detected overall, that is we could not exclude that germination rates were randomly distributed over the phylogeny. We suggest that further analyses should be conducted across wider sets of potential hosts to better characterise the existence of a phylogenetic signal of the ability of weeds to induce the germination of P.ramosa.",10.1111/wre.12222,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Do disturbance (flooding) and stress (soil fertility) gradients result in functionally and phylogenetically different riparian forests? Do patterns of functional and phylogenetic diversity follow patterns of taxonomic diversity? LocationSubtropical riparian tree community, Turvo State Park, Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. MethodsWe collected data on nine functional traits and assembled a phylogeny for all tree species found in a sample with 100 plots. We then modelled species richness and evenness, and functional and phylogenetic richness, evenness and divergence as functions of flooding frequency and soil fertility. Next, we used a three-table ordination method to look for associations between environmental conditions, the spatial locations of sampling sites and the distributions of species, trait values and lineages. We conducted these analyses for the entire area and separately for three habitats with different flooding frequencies. Finally, we tested for phylogenetic signal in functional traits. ResultsSpecies richness and evenness were highest under intermediate flooding frequency. In contrast, functional richness was negatively correlated with soil fertility, while phylogenetic richness increased with both flooding frequency and soil fertility (with phylogenetic evenness following a similar trend). Functional evenness was lowest under intermediate flooding frequency, and functional and phylogenetic divergence correlated in a complex quadratic way with both flooding and soil fertility. Functional traits were generally conserved in the phylogeny, although pioneer establishment strategy and resprouting capacity were convergent and strongly associated with frequent flooding. In contrast, the distribution of lineages was not associated with either environmental variables or site location. ConclusionsThere was a mismatch between taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns along disturbance and stress gradients. This mismatch likely occurs because functional traits involved in species sorting were either convergent or conserved in the phylogeny and because disturbance and stress gradients seem to differently affect each of the assessed diversity components. Even though disturbance seems to be the key driver of the structure of riparian tree communities, stress gradients (soil fertility) are the key predictors of important diversity components, especially functional richness. Thus, disturbance and stress gradients result in functionally and phylogenetically different riparian tree communities, leading to differences that cannot be predicted from differences in species richness and composition alone.",10.1111/jvs.12288,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Subtropical Riparian Forest,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Traits = max plant height, leaf area, seeds per fruit, dispersal mode, establishment strategy, seasonal leaf shedding, leaf area, leaf aspect ratio, latex PA, resprouting capacity after trunk breakage.

Studying changes in body mass in Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaustus) over three decades, we discovered that mean body mass declined drastically (ca. 10%) over the first two decades, but increased markedly thereafter back to almost the initial level. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed that although body mass was heritable (h2=0.46), the pronounced temporal decrease in body mass was mainly a product of phenotypic plasticity. However, a concomitant and statistically significant decrease in predicted breeding values suggests a genetic component to this change. The subsequent increase in mean body mass was indicated to be entirely due to plasticity. Selection on body mass was estimated to be too weak to fully account for the observed genetic decline in body mass, but bias in selection differential estimates due to environmental covariance between body mass and fitness is possible. Hence, the observed body mass changes appear to be driven mainly by phenotypic plasticity. Although we were not able to identify the ecological driver of the observed plastic changes, the results highlight the utility of quantitative genetic approaches in disentangling genetic and phenotypic changes in natural populations.",10.1111/jeb.12438,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

A question of considerable interest is whether ecomorphological patterns observed among species also exist at the population level. We studied variation in morphology, performance, and behaviour in four populations of Leiocephalus personatus and two populations of Leiocephalus barahonensis in the Dominican Republic. We combined these data with measurements of predation intensity and habitat structure to test for convergence at the population level. We predicted that predation intensity would be higher in open habitats and that lizards in these habitats would have traits conferring higher predator evasion capacity (increased wariness, faster sprint speeds, and longer limbs). Principal components analysis suggests that sites tend to differ with respect to the abundance and spacing of low-lying vegetation (i.e. percentage of shrub cover and distance to nearest vegetation), but we did not detect any striking differences among sites in tail-break frequencies or attacks on clay lizard models. Consistent with predictions we find that in open habitats, lizards tend to have longer limbs, faster sprint speeds (relative to body size), and longer approach distances. These patterns corroborate findings in other ground-dwelling lizard species and indicate that they have evolved at least twice among populations of Leiocephalus lizards.

Knowledge of causes for productivity declines in North American boreal forests remains limited, and this is owed to the large spatial and temporal scales involved, and the many plant processes affected. Here, the response of pristine eastern boreal North American (PEBNA) forests to ongoing climatic changes is examined using in situ data, community ecology statistics, and species-specific model simulations of carbon exchanges forced by contemporary climatic data. To examine trends in forest growth, we used a recently acquired collection of tree-ring width data from 252 sample plots distributed in PEBNA forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.). Results of linear trend analysis on the tree growth data highlight a dominating forest growth decline in overmature forests (age > 120 years) from 1950 to 2005. In contrast, improving growth conditions are seen in jack pine and mature (70-120 years) black spruce stands. Multivariate analysis of climate and growth relationships suggests that responses of PEBNA forests to climate are dependent on demographic and species traits via their mediation of temperature and water stress constraints. In support of this hypothesis, the simulation experiment suggests that in old-growth black spruce stands the benefit to growth brought on by a longer growing season may have been low in comparison with the increasing moisture stress and respiration losses caused by warmer summer temperatures. Predicted increases in wildfire frequency in PEBNA forests will likely enhance the positive response of landscape-level forest growth to climate change by shifting the forest distribution to younger age classes while also enhancing the jack pine component.",10.5194/bg-9-2523-2012,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,No environmental filtering component,

We use this principle and a size-based equilibrium model where asymptotic length is used as a functional trait to investigate how natural mortality should scale with size within and across pelagic and demersal species of North Sea teleosts. The model predicts natural mortality to scale with body length raised to a power of-1.66 at current levels of exploitation. Additionally, natural mortality of dernersal species should be proportional to asymptotic length raised to a power of 0.80, so generating a higher natural mortality at a given length for large species than for small ones. The model also suggests that the exponent in the scaling of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter K with asymptotic length should be more negative for pelagic than for clemersal species. We test our results by analysing independent estimates of predation mortality, the scaling of maximum recruitment per unit of spawning-stock biomass with asymptotic length, and the general relationship between K and asymptotic length for demersal and pelagic families of fish.

In the marine environment, the major anthropogenic drivers of change comprise exploitation, invasion by nonindigenous species, and climate change. However, the magnitude of these stressors has been widely debated and we lack empirical estimates of their relative importance. In this study, we focused on Eastern Mediterranean, a region exposed to an invasion of species of Red Sea origin, extreme climate change, and high fishing pressure. We estimated changes in fish abundance using two fish trawl surveys spanning a 20-year period, and correlated these changes with estimated sensitivity of species to the different stressors. We estimated sensitivity to invasion using the trait similarity between indigenous and nonindigenous species; sensitivity to fishing using a published composite index based on the species' life-history; and sensitivity to climate change using species climatic affinity based on occurrence data. Using both a meta-analytical method and random forest analysis, we found that for shallow-water species the most important driver of population size changes is sensitivity to climate change. Species with an affinity to warm climates increased in relative abundance and species with an affinity to cold climates decreased suggesting a strong response to warming local sea temperatures over recent decades. This decrease in the abundance of cold-water-associated species at the trailing ""warm"" end of their distribution has been rarely documented. Despite the immense biomass of nonindigenous species and the presumed high fishing pressure, these two latter factors seem to have only a minor role in explaining abundance changes. The decline in abundance of indigenous species of cold-water origin indicates a future major restructuring of fish communities in the Mediterranean in response to the ongoing warming, with unknown impacts on ecosystem function.",10.1111/gcb.13835,Y,0,0,0,1,1,0,Metanalysis/Q Model,Marine,Fish,Continental Shelf,1,0,0,1,0,Life History,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Global Change Multiple,0,0,1,1,traits = thermal niche,

Unlike terrestrial animals, the densities of aquatic animals are similar to the supporting fluid, thus even small changes in body density may have profound effects on locomotion. Here, we analysed the body composition (lipid versus lean tissue) of 32 shark species to study the evolution of buoyancy. Our comparative phylogenetic analyses indicate that although lean tissue displays minor positive allometry, liver volume exhibits pronounced positive allometry, suggesting that larger sharks evolved bulkier body compositions by adding lipid tissue to lean tissue rather than substituting lean for lipid tissue, particularly in the liver. We revealed a continuum of buoyancy control strategies that ranged from more buoyant sharks with larger livers in deeper ecosystems to relatively denser sharks with small livers in epipelagic habitats. Across this eco-morphological spectrum, our hydrodynamic modelling suggests that neutral buoyancy yields lower drag and more efficient steady swimming, whereas negative buoyancy may be more efficient during accelerated movements.

This, in turn, might reduce bacterial phylogenetic diversity by favouring one (or a few) competitive bacterial clade. We collected topsoils in 15 semi-arid plant patches and adjacent low-cover areas configuring a plant phylodiversity gradient, pyrosequenced the 16S rRNA gene to identify bacterial taxa and analysed soil fertility parameters. Structural equation modelling showed positive effects of both plant richness and phylogenetic diversity on soil fertility. Fertility increased bacterial richness but reduced bacterial phylogenetic diversity. This might be attributed to the competitive dominance of a lineage based on its high relative fitness.

This is an important gap in model development, particularly for end-to-end ecosystem models, which are becoming increasingly important tools for fisheries and ecosystem based management and assessment. Examination of large-scale and widely-applied pelagic end-to-end ecosystem models indicates that representations of predators are currently best developed for fish groups. The methods for modelling seabirds and marine mammals on the other hand, are less well developed. This is potentially due to the challenges involved in data collection and in representing the complex life histories of many of these species. To examine the effect that different representations of higher trophic level predators might have on ecosystem model predictions, we developed a set of simple nested qualitative network models and examined their responses to perturbations. Responses differed between models across a range of trophic levels under a simple scenario for environmental change, highlighting that how predators are modelled can have implications for ecosystem-level predictions.

By combining a large mesocosm experiment with a global meta-analysis, we reveal the capacity of consumers (fish and crustaceans) to resist the impacts of elevated CO2. While individual behaviours were impaired by elevated CO2, consumers could restore their performances in more complex environments that allowed for compensatory processes. Consequently, consumers maintained key traits such as foraging, habitat selection and predator avoidance despite elevated CO2 and sustained their populations. Our observed increase in risk-taking under elevated temperature, however, predicts greater vulnerability of consumers to predation. Yet, CO2 as a resource boosted the biomass of consumers through species interactions and may stabilize communities by countering the negative effects of elevated temperature.

Methods that assess patterns of phylogenetic relatedness, as well as character distribution and evolution, allow one to infer the ecological processes involved in community assembly. Assuming niche conservatism, assemblages should shift from phylogenetic clustering to evenness with decreasing geographic scale because the relative importance of mechanisms that shape assemblages is hypothesized to be scale-dependent. Whereas habitat filtering is more likely to act at regional scales because of increased habitat heterogeneity that allows sorting of ecologically similar species in contrasting environments, competition is more likely to act at local scales because low habitat heterogeneity provides few opportunities for niche partitioning. 2. We used species lists to assess assemblage composition, data on ecologically-relevant traits, and a molecular phylogeny, to examine the phylogenetic structure of antbird (Thamnophilidae) assemblages at three different geographical scales: regional (ecoregions), intermediate (100-ha plots) and local (mixed-flocks). In addition, we used patterns of phylogenetic beta diversity and beta diversity to separate the factors that structure antbird assemblages at regional scales. 3. Contrary to previous findings, we found a shift from phylogenetic evenness to clustering with decreasing geographical scale. We argue that this does not reject the hypothesis that habitat filtering is the predominant force in regional community assembly, because analyses of trait evolution and structure indicated a lack of niche conservatism in antbirds. 4. In some cases, phylogenetic evenness at regional scales can be an effect of historical biogeographic processes instead of niche-based processes. However, regional patterns of beta diversity and phylogenetic beta diversity suggested that phylogenetic structure in our study cannot be explained by the history of speciation and dispersal of antbirds, further supporting the habitat-filtering hypothesis. 5. Our analyses suggested that competitive interactions might not play an important role locally, which would provide a plausible explanation for the high alpha diversity of antbirds in Amazonia. 6.

Bats provide an excellent model to study niche use because they use a wide variety of behavioral, acoustic, and morphological traits that may lead to multi-species, functional groups. Predatory bats have been classified by their foraging location (edge, clutter, open space), ability to use aerial hawking or substrate gleaning and echolocation call design and flexibility, all of which may dictate their prey use. For example, high frequency, broadband calls do not travel far but offer high object resolution while high intensity, low frequency calls travel further but provide lower resolution. Because these behaviors can be flexible, four behavioral categories have been proposed: (a) gleaning, (b) behaviorally flexible (gleaning and hawking), (c) clutter-tolerant hawking, and (d) open space hawking. Many recent studies of diet in bats use molecular tools to identify prey but mainly focus on one or two species in isolation; few studies provide evidence for substantial differences in prey use despite the many behavioral, acoustic, and morphological differences.

The fruits that birds choose to consume are influenced by fruit traits. However, little is known of how the traits of invasive plant fruits contribute to invasiveness or to their use by frugivores. We aim to gain a greater understanding of these relationships to improve invasive plant management.LocationSouth-east Queensland, Australia.MethodsWe measure a variety of fruit morphology, pulp nutrient and phenology traits of a suite of bird-dispersed alien plants. Frugivore richness of these aliens was derived from the literature. Using regressions and multivariate methods, we investigate relationships between fruit traits, frugivore richness and invasiveness.ResultsPlant invasiveness was negatively correlated to fruit size, and all highly invasive species had quite similar fruit morphology [smaller fruits, seeds of intermediate size and few (< 10) seeds per fruit]. Lower pulp water was the only pulp nutrient trait associated with invasiveness. There were strong positive relationships between the diversity of bird frugivores and plant invasiveness, and in the diversity of bird frugivores in the study region and another part of the plants' alien range.Main conclusionsOur results suggest that weed risk assessments (WRA) and predictions of invasive success for bird-dispersed plants can be improved. Scoring criteria for WRA regarding fruit size would need to be system-specific, depending on the fruit-processing capabilities of local frugivores.

The relative importance of environmental and spatial (i.e., regional) factors structuring stream assemblages has been frequently assessed in previous large-scale studies, but biotic predictors (potentially reflecting local biotic interactions) have rarely been included. Diatoms may be useful for studying the effect of trophic interactions on community structure since: (1) a majority of experimental studies shows significant grazing effects on diatom species composition, and (2) assemblages can be divided into guilds that have different susceptibility to grazing. We used a dataset from boreal headwater streams in south-central Sweden (covering a spatial extent of similar to 14000 km(2)), which included information about diatom taxonomic composition, abundance of invertebrate grazers (biotic factor), environmental (physicochemical) and spatial factors (obtained through spatial eigenfunction analyses). We assessed the relative importance of environmental, biotic, and spatial factors structuring diatom assemblages, and performed separate analyses on different diatom guilds. Our results showed that the diatom assemblages were mainly structured by environmental factors. However, unique spatial and biological gradients, specific to different guilds and unrelated to each other, were also evident. We conclude that biological predictors, in combination with environmental and spatial variables, can reveal a more complete picture of the local vs. regional control of species assemblages in lotic environments. Biotic factors should therefore not be overlooked in applied research since they can capture additional local control and therefore increase accuracy and performance of predictive models. The inclusion of biotic predictors did, however, not significantly influence the unique fraction explained by spatial factors, which suggests low bias in previous assessments of unique regional control of stream assemblages.",10.1371/journal.pone.0072237,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Gothe, E; Angeler, DG; Sandin, L",2013,Metacommunity structure in a small boreal stream network,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"Current ecological frameworks emphasize the relative importance of local and regional drivers for structuring species communities. However, most research has been carried out in systems with discrete habitat boundaries and a clear insular structure. Stream networks deviate from the insular structure and can serve as excellent model systems for studying hierarchical community dynamics over different temporal and spatial extents. We used benthic invertebrate data from streams in a small northern Swedish catchment to test whether metacommunity dynamics change between seasons, across spatial hierarchies (i.e. at the whole catchment scale vs. the scales of first-order and second/third-order sites within the catchment) and between stream-order groups. We assessed metacommunity structure as a function of three relevant dispersal dimensions (directional downstream processes, along-stream dispersal and overland dispersal). These dispersal dimensions were related to species groups with relevant dispersal traits (flying capacity, drift propensity) and dispersal capacities (weak vs. strong) to elucidate whether the observed spatial signals were due to dispersal limitation or mass effects. Results showed complex community organization that varied between seasons, with the scale of observation, and with stream order. The importance of spatial factors and specific dispersal dimensions was highly dependent on the time of sampling and the scale of observation. The importance of environmental factors was more consistent in our analyses, but their effect on species community structure peaked at first-order sites. Our analyses of species dispersal traits were not unequivocal, but indicated that both mass effects and dispersal limitation could simultaneously contribute to the spatial signal at the scale of the whole catchment through different dispersal pathways. We conclude that the study of hierarchically organized ecosystems uncovers complex patterns of metacommunity organization that may deviate substantially from those of systems with insular structure and discrete habitat boundaries. Moreover, we show that dispersal constraints imposed by the dendritic structure of stream networks and distinct dispersal mechanisms (e.g. dispersal limitation) may be evident also at very small spatial extents. Thus, even at this small scale, a landscape management approach that takes the dendritic nature of stream networks into account is needed to effectively conserve stream biodiversity.",10.1111/1365-2656.12004,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Freshwater,Broad,Stream,0,0,0,0,1,Behavioural,1,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = drifting propensity, adult flying strength, and female dispersal.

Disentangling the different processes involved in community assembly is not only interesting in itself but also crucial for an understanding of how communities will behave under future environmental scenarios. The traditional concept of assembly rules reflects the notion that species do not co-occur randomly but are restricted in their co-occurrence by interspecific competition. This concept can be redefined in a more general framework where the co-occurrence of species is a product of chance, historical patterns of speciation and migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, and biotic interactions, with none of these processes being mutually exclusive. Here we present a survey and meta-analyses of 59 papers that compare observed patterns in plant communities with null models simulating random patterns of species assembly. According to the type of data under study and the different methods that are applied to detect community assembly, we distinguish four main types of approach in the published literature: species co-occurrence, niche limitation, guild proportionality and limiting similarity. Results from our meta-analyses suggest that non-random co-occurrence of plant species is not a widespread phenomenon. However, whether this finding reflects the individualistic nature of plant communities or is caused by methodological shortcomings associated with the studies considered cannot be discerned from the available metadata. We advocate that more thorough surveys be conducted using a set of standardized methods to test for the existence of assembly rules in data sets spanning larger biological and geographical scales than have been considered until now. We underpin this general advice with guidelines that should be considered in future assembly rules research. This will enable us to draw more accurate and general conclusions about the non-random aspect of assembly in plant communities.",10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00187.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Current syndrome research focuses primarily on behaviour with few incorporating components of physiology. One such syndrome is the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) which describes covariation between behaviour, metabolism, immunity, hormonal response, and life-history traits. Despite the strong effect temperature has on behaviour, thermal physiology has yet to be considered within this syndrome framework.2. We proposed the POLS to be extended to include a new dimension, the cold-hot axis. Under this premise, it is predicted that thermal physiology and behaviour would covary, whereby individual positioning along the thermal continuum would coincide with that of the behavioural continuum.3. This hypothesis was tested by measuring thermal traits of delicate skinks (Lampropholis delicata) and linking it to their behaviour. Principal components analysis and structural equation modelling were used to determine if traits were structured within the POLS and to characterize the direction of their interactions.4. Model results supported the inclusion of the cold-hot axis into the POLS and indicated that thermal physiology was the driver of this relationship, in that thermal traits either constrained or promoted activity, exploration, boldness and social behaviour.5.

A key challenge in this sub-discipline is establishing how important the contribution of evolutionary and ecological processes and their interactions are to observed shifts in population and community characteristics. Although a variety of metrics to separate and quantify the effects of evolutionary and ecological contributions to observed trait changes have been used, they often allocate fractions of observed changes to ecology and evolution in different ways. We used a mathematical and numerical comparison of two commonly used frameworks - the Price equationand reaction norms - to reveal that the Price equationcannot partition genetic from non-genetic trait change within lineages, whereas the reaction norm approach cannot partition among- from within-lineage trait change. We developed a new metric that combines the strengths of both Price-based and reaction norm metrics, extended all metrics to analyse community change and also incorporated extinction and colonisation of species in these metrics. Depending on whether our new metric is applied to populations or communities, it can correctly separate intraspecific, interspecific, evolutionary, non-evolutionary and interacting eco-evolutionary contributions to trait change.",10.1111/ele.12632,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Here we complement those studies by developing a conceptual model to predict litter breakdown dynamics in low order streams. According to the model, litter breakdown rates and the relative role of microbial decomposers and shredder detritivores on this process are hierarchically governed by interactions between climate/hydrology and geology acting upon plant traits, nutrient and leaf availability to decomposers, and metabolism of microbial decomposers and shredders.

Fruit-feeding butterflies were sampled with bait traps and insect nets across 25 km(2) of an Amazonian ombrophilous forest in Brazil. We measured larval diet breadth, adult body size, and wing marking of all butterflies. Our results showed that plant species richness explained most of the variation in butterfly taxonomic turnover. Also, community average diet breadth decreased with increase of plant species richness, which supports our expectations. In contrast, community average body size increased with the abundance of birds, refuting our hypothesis. We detected no influence of environmental gradients on the occurrence of species with eyespot markings. The association between butterfly taxonomic and functional composition points to a mediator role of the functional traits in the environmental filtering of butterflies.

Butterflies were sampled with bait traps in the Brazilian Amazon, while their traits and phylogenetic relatedness were either measured directly or gathered from the literature. Then, the effects of plant species turnover, light intensity, and flood risk on butterfly community patterns were tested. 3. Butterfly abundance increased with light intensity in non-forested white-sand habitats, whereas ombrophilous forests harboured higher species richness. A trade-off was observed between richness and abundance across the gradient. Plant turnover strongly drove shifts in butterfly species composition. In white-sand habitats, butterflies had higher dispersal capacity, faster flights and generalist larvae, whereas in periodically flooded plots the functional diversity of flight-related traits was higher. No phylogenetic response to environmental gradients was detected. 4.

Despite the recent interest in phylogenetic and functional diversity, our knowledge on large spatio-temporal patterns of demersal fish diversity sampled by trawling remains still incomplete, notably in the Mediterranean Sea, one of the most threatened marine regions of the world. We investigated large spatio-temporal diversity patterns by analysing a dataset of 19,886 hauls from 10 to 800 m depth performed annually during the last two decades by standardised scientific bottom trawl field surveys across the Mediterranean Sea, within the MEDITS program. A multicomponent (eight diversity indices) and multi-scale (local assemblages, biogeographic regions to basins) approach indicates that only the two most traditional components (species richness and evenness) were sufficient to reflect patterns in taxonomic, phylogenetic or functional richness and divergence. We also put into question the use of widely computed indices that allow comparing directly taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity within a unique mathematical framework. In addition, demersal fish assemblages sampled by trawl do not follow a continuous decreasing longitudinal/latitudinal diversity gradients (spatial effects explained up to 70.6% of deviance in regression tree and generalised linear models), for any of the indices and spatial scales analysed. Indeed, at both local and regional scales species richness was relatively high in the Iberian region, Malta, the Eastern Ionian and Aegean seas, meanwhile the Adriatic Sea and Cyprus showed a relatively low level. In contrast, evenness as well as taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional divergences did not show regional hotspots. All studied diversity components remained stable over the last two decades.

In Mediterranean and other water-stressed climates, water management is critical to the conservation of freshwater ecosystems. To secure and maintain water allocations for the environment, integrated water management approaches are needed that consider ecosystem flow requirements, patterns of human water demands and the temporal and spatial dynamics of water availability. 2. Human settlements in Mediterranean climates have constructed water storage and conveyance projects at a scale and level of complexity far exceeding those in other, less seasonal climates. As a result, multiple ecological stressors associated with natural periods of flooding and drying are compounded by anthropogenic impacts resulting from water infrastructure development. 3. Despite substantial investments in freshwater ecosystem conservation, particularly in California, U.S.A., success has been limited because the scales at which river management and restoration are implemented are often discordant with the temporal and spatial scales at which ecosystem processes operate. Often, there is also strong social and political resistance to restricting water allocation to existing consumptive uses for environmental protection purposes. Furthermore, institutions rarely have the capacity to develop and implement integrated management programmes needed for freshwater ecosystem conservation. 4. We propose an integrated framework for streamflow management that explicitly considers the temporal and spatial dynamics of water supply and needs of both human and natural systems. This approach makes it possible to assess the effects of alternative management strategies to human water security and ecosystem conditions and facilitates integrated decision-making by water management institutions. 5. We illustrate the framework by applying a GIS-based hydrologic model in a Mediterranean-climate watershed in Sonoma County, California, U.S.A. The model is designed to assess the hydrologic impacts of multiple water users distributed throughout a stream network. We analyse the effects of vineyard water management on environmental flows to (i) evaluate streamflow impacts from small storage ponds designed to meet human water demands and reduce summer diversions, (ii) prioritise the placement of storage ponds to meet human water needs while optimising environmental flow benefits and (iii) examine the environmental and social consequences of flow management policies designed to regulate the timing of diversions to protect ecosystem functions. 6. Thematic implications: spatially explicit models that represent anthropogenic stressors (e.g. water diversions) and environmental flow needs are required to address persistent and growing threats to freshwater biodiversity. A coupled human-natural system approach to water management is particularly useful in Mediterranean climates, characterised by severe competition for water resources and high spatial and temporal variability in flow regimes. However, lessons learned from our analyses are applicable to other highly seasonal systems and those that are expected to have increased precipitation variability resulting from climate change.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02379.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

"Green, SJ;",in review,Trait-mediated foraging drives patterns of selective predation by native and invasive fishes,ECOLOGY,"As speciesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ranges are increasingly altered by forces like climate change and biological invasion, when and where will strong biotic interactions arise within reassembled communities? Existing prey selectivity data are of limited use for predicting future consumptive interactions because they are specific to the identity and relative abundance of species in a particular assemblage. In this paper, we investigate whether the strength of consumptive interactions can instead be predicted based on a priori knowledge of morphological and behavioural traits that recur across species and are hypothesized to affect the predation process. To test this Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtraits-basedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ approach, we conducted multi-species foraging trials with coral-reef fishes in the Caribbean, a diverse, trait-rich fauna for which interactions are likely shifting rapidly due to the introduction of predatory Indo-Pacific lionfish. We evaluated predictions about the combined effects of three behavioral traitsÃ¢â‚¬â€water column position of both predator and prey, anti-predator aggregation behavior of prey, and hunting strategy of predatorsÃ¢â‚¬â€on successive phases of the predation process and ultimately the strength of consumptive interactions. Tracking predator and prey behaviors reveals that inter- specific variation in traits mediates encounter, attack, and capture rates. Behaviorally-driven bottlenecks at different stages of the process underpinned selective consumption by each predator species, and resulted in large differences in total predation mortality rates among prey species. Our analysis also suggests that unique behaviors exhibited by invasive lionfish, rather than naiÃŒË†ve responses by prey, mediate their foraging success relative to native predators.

"Green, SJ; Cote, IM",2014,Trait-based diet selection: prey behaviour and morphology predict vulnerability to predation in reef fish communities,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"Understanding how predators select their prey can provide important insights into community structure and dynamics. However, the suite of prey species available to a predator is often spatially and temporally variable. As a result, species-specific selectivity data are of limited use for predicting novel predator-prey interactions because they are assemblage specific. We present a method for predicting diet selection that is applicable across prey assemblages, based on identifying general morphological and behavioural traits of prey that confer vulnerability to predation independent of species identity. We apply this trait-based approach to examining prey selection by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles), invasive predators that prey upon species-rich reef fish communities and are rapidly spreading across the western Atlantic. We first generate hypotheses about morphological and behavioural traits recurring across fish species that could facilitate or deter predation by lionfish. Constructing generalized linear mixed-effects models that account for relatedness among prey taxa, we test whether these traits predict patterns of diet selection by lionfish within two independent data sets collected at different spatial scales: (i) in situ visual observations of prey consumption and availability for individual lionfish and (ii) comparisons of prey abundance in lionfish stomach contents to availability on invaded reefs at large. Both analyses reveal that a number of traits predicted to affect vulnerability to predation, including body size, body shape, position in the water column and aggregation behaviour, are important determinants of diet selection by lionfish. Small, shallow-bodied, solitary fishes found resting on or just above reefs are the most vulnerable. Fishes that exhibit parasite cleaning behaviour experience a significantly lower risk of predation than non-cleaning fishes, and fishes that are nocturnally active are at significantly greater risk. Together, vulnerable traits heighten the risk of predation by a factor of nearly 200. Our study reveals that a trait-based approach yields insights into predator-prey interactions that are robust across prey assemblages. Importantly, in situ observations of selection yield similar results to broadscale comparisons of prey use and availability, which are more typically gathered for predator species. A trait-based approach could therefore be of use across predator species and ecosystems to predict the outcomes of changing predator-prey interactions on community dynamics.",10.1111/1365-2656.12250,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Marine,Fish,Coral Reef,0,1,0,0,1,"Morphological, Behavioural",2,0,0,0,,,1,T,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"traits = body shape, body size, physical/chemical defnese, cleaning behaviour, aggregation size, nocturnally active, water column position",

The regulation of river flows to provide water for agriculture often results in changes to flow timing. This study assesses the impact of altered seasonal flow patterns on riverine flora. Within temperate Australia, we surveyed the vegetation of five lowland rivers, three of which have large dams that alter their seasonal flow patterns; the other two are unregulated. From four to six sites were selected on each river, and these were classified into three levels of regulation based on the extent to which the timing of their seasonal flow patterns were altered. Sites were surveyed in winter and the following summer. Permanent quadrats were also established at a number of the surveyed sites and resurveyed every 3months. Of the 267 plant taxa identified, 145 were exotic (non-native). More exotic taxa and fewer native taxa were associated with increasing level of seasonal flow inversion (regulation). In particular, greater numbers of short-lived exotic terrestrial taxa and fewer native woody taxa were associated with increasing level of regulation. Some exotic woody species (e.g. willows) were more common in the unregulated rivers and may have life-history traits favoured by the natural seasonal flow patterns of study area. Multivariate analyses showed that level of regulation had a significant effect on the overall composition of the riverine vegetation. Our results provide support for the hypotheses that flow regulation adversely affects native species diversity and increases the vulnerability of riparian zones to invasion by exotic species; however, these effects are dependent on plant species' life-history strategies. Our study highlights the importance of natural seasonal flow patterns for sustaining native riverine plant communities. Flow management aimed at maintaining or restoring ecological values should consider seasonal flow patterns. Winter/spring flow peaks may be particularly important for the recruitment of native riverine plants, especially trees and shrubs, and reducing the extent of exotic annuals and grasses.

"Griffith, DM; Veech, JA; Marsh, CJ",2016,cooccur: Probabilistic Species Co-Occurrence Analysis in R,JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE,"The observation that species may be positively or negatively associated with each other is at least as old as the debate surrounding the nature of community structure which began in the early 1900's with Gleason and Clements. Since then investigating species co-occurrence patterns has taken a central role in understanding the causes and consequences of evolution, history, coexistence mechanisms, competition, and environment for community structure and assembly. This is because co-occurrence among species is a measurable metric in community datasets that, in the context of phylogeny, geography, traits, and environment, can sometimes indicate the degree of competition, displacement, and phylogenetic repulsion as weighed against biotic and environmental effects promoting correlated species distributions. Historically, a multitude of different co-occurrence metrics have been developed and most have depended on data randomization procedures to produce null distributions for significance testing. Here we improve upon and present an R implementation of a recently published model that is metric-free, distribution-free, and randomization-free. The R package, cooccur, is highly accessible, easily integrates into common analyses, and handles large datasets with high performance. In the article we develop the package's functionality and demonstrate aspects of co-occurrence analysis using three sample datasets.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Grimm, V; Berger, U",2016,"Structural realism, emergence, and predictions in next-generation ecological modelling: Synthesis from a special issue",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"The two main challenges of ecological modelling are to yield more general understanding and theory and to provide testable and robust predictions. To achieve this, emergence, structural realism, and prediction have to become key elements of designing models. In the special issue ""Next-generation ecological modelling"", which is dedicated to Donald DeAngelis on the occasion of his 70th birthday, 16 contributions present and discuss main features of next-generation ecological modelling. One key feature is to base the description of individuals' behaviour and interactions on first principles rooted in energetic or evolutionary theory. To cope with increasing model complexity, standardization, separate testing of alternative submodels against multiple output patterns, and documenting these tests will be required. Including micro-evolution is essential to capture organisms' response to changing conditions. Functional types may be used instead of species for representing communities. Model analysis will be challenging, but robustness analysis, which tries to break models' explanations, can help to tell signals from noise and identify general mechanisms underlying the internal organization of ecological systems. Ultimately, next-generation modelling should aim at developing general theory to better understand stability properties and mechanisms. This understanding then can provide the basis for restoring, maintaining, or strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and supporting sustainable management of natural resources.

"Grinath, JB; Inouye, BD; Underwood, N; Billick, I",2012,The indirect consequences of a mutualism: comparing positive and negative components of the net interaction between honeydew-tending ants and host plants,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. In ecological webs, net indirect interactions between species are composed of interactions that vary in sign and magnitude. Most studies have focused on negative component interactions (e.g. predation, herbivory) without considering the relative importance of positive interactions (e.g. mutualism, facilitation) for determining net indirect effects. 2. In plant/arthropod communities, ants have multiple top-down effects via mutualisms with honeydew-producing herbivores and harassment of and predation on other herbivores; these ant effects provide opportunities for testing the relative importance of positive and negative interspecific interactions. We manipulated the presence of ants, honeydew-producing membracids and leaf-chewing beetles on perennial host plants in field experiments in Colorado to quantify the relative strength of these different types of interactions and their impact on the ant's net indirect effect on plants. 3. In 2007, we demonstrated that ants simultaneously had a positive effect on membracids and a negative effect on beetles, resulting in less beetle damage on plants hosting the mutualism. 4. In 2008, we used structural equation modelling to describe interaction strengths through the entire insect herbivore community on plants with and without ants. The ant's mutualism with membracids was the sole strong interaction contributing to the net indirect effect of ants on plants. Predation, herbivory and facilitation were weak, and the net effect of ants reduced plant reproduction. This net indirect effect was also partially because of behavioural changes of herbivores in the presence of ants. An additional membracid manipulation showed that the membracid's effect on ant activity was largely responsible for the ant's net effect on plants; ant workers were nearly ten times as abundant on plants with mutualists, and effects on other herbivores were similar to those in the ant manipulation experiment. 5. These results demonstrate that mutualisms can be strong relative to negative direct interspecific interactions and that positive interactions deserve attention as important components of ecological webs.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01929.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Grol, MGG; Nagelkerken, I; Rypel, AL; Layman, CA",2011,Simple ecological trade-offs give rise to emergent cross-ecosystem distributions of a coral reef fish,OECOLOGIA,"Ecosystems are intricately linked by the flow of organisms across their boundaries, and such connectivity can be essential to the structure and function of the linked ecosystems. For example, many coral reef fish populations are maintained by the movement of individuals from spatially segregated juvenile habitats (i.e., nurseries, such as mangroves and seagrass beds) to areas preferred by adults. It is presumed that nursery habitats provide for faster growth (higher food availability) and/or low predation risk for juveniles, but empirical data supporting this hypothesis is surprisingly lacking for coral reef fishes. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms (growth, predation risk, and reproductive investment) that give rise to the distribution patterns of a common Caribbean reef fish species, Haemulon flavolineatum (French grunt). Adults were primarily found on coral reefs, whereas juvenile fish only occurred in non-reef habitats. Contrary to our initial expectations, analysis of length-at-age revealed that growth rates were highest on coral reefs and not within nursery habitats. Survival rates in tethering trials were 0% for small juvenile fish transplanted to coral reefs and 24-47% in the nurseries. As fish grew, survival rates on coral reefs approached those in non-reef habitats (56 vs. 77-100%, respectively). As such, predation seems to be the primary factor driving across-ecosystem distributions of this fish, and thus the primary reason why mangrove and seagrass habitats function as nursery habitat. Identifying the mechanisms that lead to such distributions is critical to develop appropriate conservation initiatives, identify essential fish habitat, and predict impacts associated with environmental change.",10.1007/s00442-010-1833-8,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Marine,Fish,Coral Reef,0,1,0,1,0,"Morphological, Life History",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = total length, growth rate, survival rate, reproductive investment ",
"Gross, N; Borger, L; Duncan, RP; Hulme, PE",2013,Functional differences between alien and native species: do biotic interactions determine the functional structure of highly invaded grasslands?,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Although observed functional differences between alien and native plant species support the idea that invasions are favoured by niche differentiation (ND), when considering invasions along large ecological gradients, habitat filtering (HF) has been proposed to constrain alien species such that they exhibit similar trait values to natives. To reconcile these contrasting observations, we used a multiscale approach using plant functional traits to evaluate how biotic interactions with native species and grazing might determine the functional structure of highly invaded grasslands along an elevation gradient in New Zealand. At a regional scale, functional differences between alien and native plant species translated into nonrandom community assembly and high ND. Alien and native species showed contrasting responses to elevation and the degree of ND between them decreased as elevation increased, suggesting a role for HF. At the plant-neighbourhood scale, species with contrasting traits were generally spatially segregated, highlighting the impact of biotic interactions in structuring local plant communities. A confirmatory multilevel path analysis showed that the effect of elevation and grazing was moderated by the presence of native species, which in turn influenced the local abundance of alien species. Our study showed that functional differences between aliens and natives are fundamental to understand the interplay between multiple mechanisms driving alien species success and their coexistence with natives. In particular, the success of alien species is driven by the presence of native species which can have a negative (biotic resistance) or a positive (facilitation) effect depending on the functional identity of alien species.

Using a phylogenetic comparative framework, we tested whether delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic composition from individual lizards was correlated with species-specific estimates of diet and habitat use. We find that species are highly divergent in isotopic composition with significant correlations to habitat use, but this relationship shows no phylogenetic signal. Isotopic composition corresponds to empirical observations of diet for some species but much variation remains unexplained.

We fertilized nutrient limited plots and excluded insectivorous birds in a randomized block design, and examined the impacts on arthropods associated with the dominant tree in the Hawaiian Islands, Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae). After 33 months, the species load (per foliage mass) of herbivores and carnivores increased with fertilization, but rarified richness (standardized to abundance) did not change. Fertilization depressed species richness of arboreal detritivores, and carnivore richness dropped in caged, unfertilized plots, both because of the increased dominance of common, introduced species with treatments. Herbivore species abundance distributions were more equitable than other trophic levels following treatments, and fertilization added specialized native species without changing relativized species richness. Overall, bird removal and nutrient addition treatments on arthropod richness acted largely independently, but with countervailing influences that obscured distinct top-down and bottom-up effects on different trophic levels. This study demonstrates that species composition, biological invasions, and the individuality of species traits may complicate efforts to predict the interactive effects of resources and predation on species diversity in food webs.",10.1007/s00442-005-0337-4,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Grunst, Melissa L.; Grunst, Andrea S.; Rotenberry, John T.",2014,Phenotypic plasticity in nest departure calls: weighing costs and benefits,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"In birds, male song has been extensively studied, but female vocalizations have received little attention. Females of several North American species produce a unique vocalization, the nest departure call (NDC), upon leaving nests. Producing NDCs has costs due to acoustical properties that make nests easy to locate by predators. Thus, NDCs must also have benefits that balance or outweigh costs, and females should modulate call production as costs and benefits change. We explored whether female song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, adjust calling rate to reflect differential costs and benefits of calling induced by male presence, male quality (measured by body mass and song complexity), nest predator presence and nest height. Results suggest that calls benefit females by promoting male nest guarding and that females display adaptive plasticity in call production. Specifically, calling rate increased when the male was present, and male nest guarding increased when females gave an NDC. Females called less in the presence of a model nest predator, probably because the perceived costs of predator attraction outweighed the benefits of male recruitment. Conversely, females with heavier mates called more, perhaps because the efficacy of male nest guarding increases with mass. In addition, females called more from elevated nests in the presence of the predator and decreased calling later in the day. Male song complexity failed to predict calling rate, suggesting that this sexually selected trait does not reflect direct benefits gained by producing an NDC. Plasticity in calling probably exists because context-appropriate communication elevates fitness, whereas contextual mistakes in the decision to communicate result in fitness declines.

"Gu, Huan; Singh, Aditya; Townsend, Philip A.",2015,Detection of gradients of forest composition in an urban area using imaging spectroscopy,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,"Forests play an important role in urban environments by providing a range of ecosystem services. However, forest composition and function in urban ecosystems are ecologically complex because of high heterogeneity of the landscape and long legacies of intensive human management. Accurate quantification and mapping of composition of tree taxa in urban forests using remote sensing require high spatial and spectral resolution imagery. As such, mapping of individual species over large areas is impractical, so instead we map gradients of composition based on canopy traits derived from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) and lidar. This trait-based approach depicts emergent functional overlaps due to pixel-scale mixing of disparate species or genera found in the region. This provides a basis for understanding forest functioning in urban ecosystems where multiple taxa are functionally and spectrally similar. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to ordinate multi-dimensional forest composition data, where NMDS scores (NMDS1 and NMDS2) represent compositional gradients. Predictive models of NMDS1 and NMDS2 were built using AVIRIS-derived foliar traits such as nitrogen concentration and lidar structural variables. Gradients of composition were strongly related to AVIRIS-derived traits (R-2 = 0.67 for NMDS1 and R-2 = 0.47 for NMDS2). Lidar-derived structural variables provided no improvement to prediction of the first NMDS axis estimates, and a minimal improvement (3% more variance explained) on NMDS2. We applied predictive models of NMDS1 and NMDS2 to maps of predictor traits to map NMDS1 and NMDS2. From the NMDS1 and NMDS2 maps, we mapped potential composition patterns and associated uncertainties by genus from the ordination of the field data. Our maps of composition gradients show the potential for data from imaging spectrometers such as HyspIRI to comprehensively characterize the diversity of ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes. Moderate resolution satellite imagery may not facilitate detection of individual species, but imaging spectroscopy provides a basis to estimate the potential distribution of particular taxa based on assemblages associated with foliar traits that can be derived from imaging spectroscopy. Comprehensive satellite-based mapping will provide basic understanding and spatially explicit information on forest functioning suitable for monitoring and management of urban ecosystems.

Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll a Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought,PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,"Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in Brassica rapa (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (Picea engelmannii and Pinus contorta) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.",10.1104/pp.16.00581,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

It assumes that extinction and adaptation are negligible at ecological scales. Meanwhile, shifts associated with global change have been observed in metacommunity composition (species pools affected by extinctions and introductions) and in phenotypes. This suggests that predictions of future composition must move beyond re-sorting present-day species with fixed traits. We extend plant species-sorting concepts to consider biogeography and demography. We give an empirical context, highlighting the influences of biogeography, species-sorting and adaptation on community composition. LocationGlobal; case studies focus on the terrestrial mediterranean biome. MethodsWe review case studies of empirical approaches that have examined community composition at various scales. We develop a mathematical model based on community mechanics that incorporates species-sorting with shifting phenotypes and species pools. ResultsAs illustrated by real examples, community composition is influenced by factors such as history, modern extinction risk, species-sorting, biotic interactions, adaptation and ecological drift. There is ample evidence that species pools and phenotypes are not constant at ecological scales in the context of global change. Any implicit assumption in community analysis that they are constant should therefore be revisited. Our model breaks down shifting community constraints into intraspecific components - including genotype sorting, selection and plasticity - and interspecific components, including changes in relative abundance and species replacement from a shifting metacommunity. Main conclusionsPredictions of community composition could benefit from extending species-sorting, to allow species pools and species traits to shift through time, as dealt with explicitly in our framework. The model predicts that responses to a shifting community constraint can be more diverse than deterministic species re-sorting. Consequently, the rate of species replacement depends on factors such as species adaptive capacity, competition, physical disturbance and habitat fragmentation.",10.1111/geb.12184,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,1,"thought it was relevant at first, but they never actually tested the traits.

The inclusion of ENA methods in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) has insured their continued contribution to ecosystem-based management. In EwE, ENA-derived ecological conclusions are currently based on single values of ENA indices calculated from a unique input flow matrix. Here, we document an easy-to-use routine that allows EwE users to incorporate uncertainty in EwE input data into the calculation of ENA indices. This routine, named ENAtool, is a suite of Matlab functions that performs three main steps: (1) import of an existing Ecopath model and its associated parameter uncertainty values in the form of uncertainty intervals into Matlab; (2) generation of an ensemble of Ecopath models with the same structure as the original, and with parameter values varying based on the prescribed uncertainty limits; and (3) calculation of a set of 13 ENA indices for each ensemble member (one set of flow values) and of summary statistics across the whole ensemble. This novel routine offers the opportunity to calculate ENA indices ranges and confidence intervals, and thus to perform quantitative data analyses. An application of ENAtool on a pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf is presented, with a focus on the robustness of previously published ENA-based ecological traits of this ecosystem when the newly introduced uncertainty values are added. We also describe the sensitivity of the ENAtool results to both the number of ensemble members used and to the uncertainty interval set around each input parameter. Ecological conclusions derived from EwE, particularly those regarding the comparison of structural and functional elements for a range of ecosystem types or the assessment of ecosystem properties along gradients of environmental conditions or anthropogenic disturbances, will gain in statistical interpretability.

Holistic credentials for ecology may thus be restored on two bases: its accommodating complementary modes of analysis and explanation, and its having some laws within the least reductionistic mode consistent with its subject matter.

These traits can be preadapted prior to introduction, but can also be acquired through evolution following introduction to the new range. Disentangling the origins of these advantageous traits is a fundamental and emerging question in invasion ecology. We conducted a multiple comparative experiment under identical environmental condition with the invasive haplotype M lineage of the wetland grass Phragmites australis and compared the ecophysiological traits of this invasive haplotype M in North America with those of the European ancestor and the conspecific North American native haplotype E lineage, P.australis ssp.americanus. The invasive haplotype M differed significantly from the native North American conspecific haplotype E in several ecophysiological and morphological traits, and the European haplotype M had a more efficient photosynthetic apparatus than the native North American P.australis ssp.americanus. Within the haplotype M lineage, the introduced North American P.australis exhibited different biomass allocation patterns and resource/energy-use strategies compared to its European ancestor group. A discriminant analysis of principal components separated the haplotype M and the haplotype E lineages completely along the first canonical axis, highly related to photosynthetic gas-exchange parameters, photosynthetic energy-use efficiency and payback time. The second canonical axis, highly related to photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and construction costs, significantly separated the introduced P.australis in North America from its European ancestor. Synthesis. We conclude that the European P.australis lineage was preadapted to be invasive prior to its introduction, and that the invasion in North America is further stimulated by rapid post-introduction evolution in several advantageous traits. The multicomparison approach used in this study could be an effective approach for distinguishing preadaptation and post-introduction evolution of invasive species.

Although most community ecology studies represent temporal snap shots, long-term observations are rather rare. However, only such time series allow the identification of species composition shifts over several decades or even centuries. We analyzed changes in the species composition of a southeastern German butterfly and burnet moth community over nearly 2 centuries (1840-2013). We classified all species observed over this period according to their ecological tolerance, thereby assessing their degree of habitat specialisation. This classification was based on traits of the butterfly and burnet moth species and on their larval host plants. We collected data on temperature and precipitation for our study area over the same period. The number of species declined substantially from 1840 (117 species) to 2013 (71 species). The proportion of habitat specialists decreased, and most of these are currently endangered. In contrast, the proportion of habitat generalists increased. Species with restricted dispersal behavior and species in need of areas poor in soil nutrients had severe losses. Furthermore, our data indicated a decrease in species composition similarity between different decades over time. These data on species composition changes and the general trends of modifications may reflect effects from climate change and atmospheric nitrogen loads, as indicated by the ecological characteristics of host plant species and local changes in habitat configuration with increasing fragmentation. Our observation of major declines over time of currently threatened and protected species shows the importance of efficient conservation strategies.

Using data on the incidence and abundance of 206 flea species on 121 mammal species, we illustrate our method and compare it to previously used methods for detecting host-parasite coevolution. At large spatial scales we find that the phylogenetic interaction effect was substantial, indicating that related parasite species were more likely to be found on related host species. At smaller spatial scales, and when sampling effort was not controlled for, phylogenetic effects on the number and types of parasite species harbored by hosts were found to dominate. We go on to show that in situations where these additional phylogenetic effects exist, then previous methods have very high Type I error rates when testing for the phylogenetic interaction. Our GLMM method represents a robust and reliable approach to quantify the phylogenetic effects of traits determined by, or defined by, ecological interactions and has the advantage that it can easily be extended and interpreted in a broader context than existing permutation tests.",10.1086/674445,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Despite considerable improvements in our understanding of how species richness responds to urbanization, there is still insufficient knowledge of how other measures of assemblage composition and structure respond to urban development. Functional diversity metrics provide a useful approach for quantifying ecological function. We compare avian functional diversity in 25 urban areas, located across the globe, with paired non-urban assemblages using a database of 27 functional traits that capture variation in resource use (amount and type of resources and how they are acquired) across the 529 species occurring across these assemblages. Using three standard functional diversity metrics (FD, MNTD, and convex hull) we quantify observed functional diversity and, using standardized effect sizes, how this diverges from that expected under random community assembly null models. We use regression trees to investigate whether human population density, amount of vegetation and city size (spatial extent of urban land), bio-region and use of semi-natural or agricultural assemblages as a baseline modulate the effect of urbanization on functional diversity. Our analyses suggest that observed functional diversity of urban avian assemblages is not consistently different from that of non-urban assemblages. After accounting for species richness avian functional diversity is higher in cities than areas of semi-natural habitat. This creates a paradox as species responses to urban development are determined by their ecological traits, which should generate assemblages clustered within a narrow range of trait space. Greater habitat diversity within cities compared to semi-natural areas dominated by a single habitat may enhance functional diversity in cities and explain this paradox. Regression trees further suggest that smaller urban areas, lower human population densities and increased vegetation all enhance the functional diversity of urban areas. A city's attributes can thus influence the functional diversity of its biological assemblages, and their associated ecological functions. This has important implications for the debate regarding how we should grow the world's cities whilst maintaining their ecological function.",10.3389/fevo.2017.00084,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Review,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,"Morphological, Life History, Behavioural",3,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,traits = Body mass (g)	Average Clutch.Size	Vertebrates	Invertebrates	Plants	Nectar	Pursuit	Probing	Gleaning	Digging	Grazing	Pouncing	Scavenging	Water	Mud	Ground	Vegetation	Air	Rocks	Ground	Cavities in cliffs rock or ground	Tree cavities	Other vegetation	Artifacts	Water vegetation	Nocturnal	Obligate brood parasite,
"Hall, Michelle L.; Kingma, Sjouke A.; Peters, Anne",2013,Male Songbird Indicates Body Size with Low-Pitched Advertising Songs,PLOS ONE,"Body size is a key sexually selected trait in many animal species. If size imposes a physical limit on the production of loud low-frequency sounds, then low-pitched vocalisations could act as reliable signals of body size. However, the central prediction of this hypothesis - that the pitch of vocalisations decreases with size among competing individuals - has limited support in songbirds. One reason could be that only the lowest-frequency components of vocalisations are constrained, and this may go unnoticed when vocal ranges are large. Additionally, the constraint may only be apparent in contexts when individuals are indeed advertising their size. Here we explicitly consider signal diversity and performance limits to demonstrate that body size limits song frequency in an advertising context in a songbird. We show that in purple-crowned fairy-wrens, Malurus coronatus coronatus, larger males sing lower-pitched low-frequency advertising songs. The lower frequency bound of all advertising song types also has a significant negative relationship with body size. However, the average frequency of all their advertising songs is unrelated to body size. This comparison of different approaches to the analysis demonstrates how a negative relationship between body size and song frequency can be obscured by failing to consider signal design and the concept of performance limits. Since these considerations will be important in any complex communication system, our results imply that body size constraints on low-frequency vocalisations could be more widespread than is currently recognised.",10.1371/journal.pone.0056717,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Hall, SR; Shurin, JB; Diehl, S; Nisbet, RM",2007,"Food quality, nutrient limitation of secondary production, and the strength of trophic cascades",OIKOS,"Recent meta-analyses confirm that the strength of trophic cascades (indirect positive effects of predators on plant biomass through control of herbivores) varies among ecosystem types. In particular, most terrestrial systems show smaller cascades than most aquatic ones. Ecologists still remain challenged to explain this variation. Here, we examine a food quality hypothesis which states that higher quality plants should promote stronger trophic cascades. Food quality involves two components: digestion resistance of plants and magnitude of stoichiometric imbalance between plants and herbivores (where stoichiometry involves ratios of nutrient: carbon ratio of tissues). Both factors vary among ecosystems and could mediate conversion efficiency of plants into new herbivores (and hence control of plants by herbivores). We explored the food quality hypothesis using two models, one assuming that plant stoichiometry is a fixed trait, the other one allowing this trait to vary dynamically (but with a minimal nutrient: carbon ratio of structural mass). Both models produce the same suite of results. First, as expected, systems with more easily digested plants promote stronger cascades. Second, contrary to expectations, higher (fixed or minimal) nutrient: carbon ratio of plants do not promote stronger cascades, largely because of the net result of ecosystem feedbacks. Still, the model with dynamic stoichiometry permits positive correlations of realized plant nutrient: carbon ratio and cascade strength (as predicted), mediated through digestion resistance. Third, lower nutrient: carbon ratio of herbivores promotes stronger cascades. However, this result likely cannot explain variation in cascade strength because nutrient: carbon stoichiometry of herbivores does not vary greatly between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Finally, we found that predation promotes nutrient limitation of herbivores. This finding highlights that food web processes, such as predation, can influence stoichiometry-mediated interactions of plants and herbivores.",10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15875.x,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,1,0,,"I don't think this is relevant, but just want to check",

California sheephead Semicossyphus pulcher are common predators of benthic invertebrates in kelp beds and rocky reefs in southern California, USA. Through gut content and stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses, we investigated geographic and ontogenetic variation in trophic ecology across 9 populations located at island and mainland sites throughout southern California. We found extensive geographic variation in California sheephead diet composition over small spatial scales. Populations differed in the proportion of sessile filter/suspension feeders or mobile invertebrates in the diet. Spatial variation in diet was highly correlated with other life history and demographic traits (e. g. growth, survivorship, reproductive condition, and energy storage), in addition to proxies of prey availability from community surveys. Multivariate descriptions of the diet from gut contents roughly agreed with the spatial groupings of sites based on stable isotope analysis of both California sheephead and their prey. Ontogenetic changes in diet occurred consistently across populations, despite spatial differences in size structure. As California sheephead increase in size, diets shift from small filter feeders, like bivalves, to larger mobile invertebrates, such as sea urchins.

It presents an algorithm that classifies the output of a range shift model for major tree species in Europe into multiple classes that can be linked to qualities characterizing the ecological niche of the species. The classes: i) Core distribution area, ii) Extended distribution area, iii) Occasional occurrence area, and iv) No occurrence area are first theoretically developed and then statistically described. The classes are interpreted from an ecological point of view using criteria like population structure, competitive strength, site spectrum and vulnerability to biotic hazards. The functioning of the algorithm is demonstrated using the example of a generalized linear model that was fitted to a pan-European dataset of presence/absence of major tree species with downscaled climate data from a General Circulation Model (GCM). Applications of the algorithm to tree species suitability classification on a European and regional level are shown. The thresholds that are used by the algorithm are precision-based and include Cohen's Kappa. A validation of the algorithm using an independent dataset of the German National Forest Inventory shows good accordance of the statistically derived classes with ecological traits for Norway spruce, while the differentiation especially between core and extended distribution for European beech that is in the centre of its natural range in this area is less accurate. We hypothesize that for species in the core of their range regional factors like forest history superimpose climatic factors. Problems of uncertainty issued from potentially applying a multitude of modelling approaches and/or climate realizations within the range shift model are discussed and a way to deal with the uncertainty by revealing the underlying attitude towards risk of the decision maker is proposed.

"Hanke, MH; Lambert, JD; Smith, KJ",2014,Utilization of a multicriteria least cost path model in an aquatic environment,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,"A critical component of maintaining biodiversity in fragmented habitats is maintaining connectivity among the usable fragments. Least cost path (LCP) analysis is a tool that can be used for predicting the ability of an organism to move from one habitat patch to another, based on geographical features of the landscape and life history traits of the organism. While this analysis has been utilized for terrestrial habitats, it is rarely applied to aquatic environments. Aquatic hypoxic conditions occur when dissolved oxygen falls below 2mg/L. These conditions can create barriers in the water column that can either force fish to leave a habitat, or avoid that habitat altogether. Using the lower St. Johns River (LSJR) estuary in Florida, USA, as a study system, the ability of an adult silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura, to escape a large-scale hypoxic event was modeled using a multicriteria LCP approach. Criteria-specific cost grids were constructed based upon current speed, risk of predation, and whether oxygen levels in the habitat area were normoxic (>5.5mg/L), or hypoxic (<2.0-1.5mg/L) as a function of water depth for the LSJR. The criteria cost grids were combined using relative weighting to produce the multicriteria cost grid used to implement the LCP analysis. Three origin and destination point locations within the LSJR study area were selected for modeling whether or not a silver perch would be able to escape a hypoxic zone. Since the LCP model will always determine a LCP from the specified origin point location, ecologically relevant swimming capacities for silver perch under normoxic and hypoxic conditions were then applied to assess the model, and to determine whether the fish would be able to reach areas unimpacted by hypoxia. The LCP model and the swimming capacity results for this study predict that under normoxic conditions, fish movement was unimpeded. During the rapidly developing hypoxic event that was modeled, the results from the LCP model indicate that the fish could move outside the hypoxic zone, but when swimming capacities were applied to the model, the silver perch could not escape. Ecologically, the results of this study suggest that silver perch would experience high mortality under a rapidly developing hypoxic event. Additionally, the results of this study indicate that a LCP model can be applied to an aquatic habitat, as long as the cost grids incorporate relevant abiotic and biotic factors.",10.1080/13658816.2013.861465,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Marine,Fish,Estuary,1,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,1,0,,,0,P,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = swimming speed, hypoxic tolerance.

This paper presents initial tests relevant to these hypotheses. First, the representation of various life-history guilds in avifaunas from the Eastern Deciduous (EDF) and Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests were compared. Three guilds contained more species in the EDF community (large patch and/or habitat interior guild, small patch and/or edge guild, and fragmentation-sensitive guild). The guild of predators requiring large forest tracts was better represented in the PNW. Next, the relative sensitivity of each community to habitat change was ranked based on the life-history traits of their species. The EDF avifauna had a significantly higher index of sensitivity to both forest fragmentation and to landscape change in general. Among the birds with high scores for sensitivity to landscape change were several species that have received little conservation attention thus far including some associated with open-canopy habitats. Lastly, the validity of using life histories to predict community response to landscape change was supported by the fact that the sensitivity scores for PNW species correlated significantly with independent data on species population trends. While more rigorous analyses are suggested, we conclude that knowledge of life histories is useful for predicting community response to landscape change and that conservation strategies should be uniquely tailored to local communities.",10.1007/BF00133308,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Q Model,Terrestrial,Birds,Temperate Forest,0,0,0,1,1,"Life History, Behavioural",2,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = reproductive effort, nest type, nest height, territory size, territory density, seral stage association, microhabitat association, feeding strategy, response to edge, repsonse to patch size.

We present an idealized analysis of the competitive relationship between zooplanktivorous jellyfish that is based on a generic model, termed 'Killing the Winner' (KtW), for the coexistence of 2 groups utilizing the same resource. Tactile predation by jellyfish makes them less dependent on water optics than fish using vision, and we modified the KtW model to account for this particular trait difference. Expectations of the model are illustrated by use of observations from the Baltic Sea. The model predicts a general succession on how mass of the system distributes when going from an oligotrophic to a eutrophic system. Initially the mass of the system accumulates at the level of the common resource (zooplankton) and planktivorous fish (sprat/herring). At one point, with increased eutrophication, mass starts to accumulate at the level of the top predator (cod) and at a later point, at the level of the jellyfish.

The cessation of sealing along coastal Australia and subsequent recovery of Australian Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus and long-nosed A. forsteri fur seals represents a unique opportunity to investigate trophic linkages at a frontier of predator recolonisation. We characterised the diets of both species across 2 locations of recolonisation, one site an established breeding colony, and the other, a new but permanent haul-out site. Using DNA metabarcoding, high taxonomic resolution data on diets was used to inform ecological trait-based analyses across time and location. Australian and long-nosed fur seals consumed 76 and 73 prey taxa, respectively, a prey diversity greater than previously reported. We found unexpected overlap of prey functional traits in the diets of both seal species at the haul-out site, where we observed strong trophic linkages with coastal ecosystems due to the prevalence of benthic, demersal and reef-associated prey. The diets of both seal species at the breeding colony were consistent with for aging patterns observed in the centre of their geographic range regarding diet partitioning between predator species and seasonal trends typically observed. The unexpected differences between sites in this region and the convergence of both predators' effective ecological roles at the range-edge haul-out site correlate with known differences in seal population densities and demographics at these and other newly recolonised locations.

Understanding these patterns is important for predicting future community composition in the context of climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances. However, we know little about how these environmental stressors might change interspecific interactions. Here we present an analysis on the role of putative foundation species (cushion-type life forms) in determining the phylogenetic community composition of vascular plants at the local scale. We also investigated how community diversity and structure shifts across an environmental severity gradient. Abundance data for vascular plants was collected within and outside of four focal cushion plant species along an elevation gradient in Canadian alpine tundra. We compared differences in species-specific abundance within plots with foundation plants to the same measure in adjacent open plots. Using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny, we quantified community structure metrics, including the net relatedness index (NRI), a novel net relatedness to focal index (NRFI), and an index of species co-occurrence across the gradient. We examined the trends in these indices with cushion plant presence/absence and environmental severity using both linear regression and mixed effect models. We found that the loss of species richness at higher elevations was counterbalanced by a decrease in interspecific relatedness, maintaining phylogenetic diversity across the gradient. We found no evidence for community diversity or structure modifications by cushion plants, nor any evidence that species were preferentially associating with these hypothesized foundation species. On the contrary, many species had significantly negative co-occurrence with the cushion plants. Overall, our results suggest that the cushion plant life forms may exhibit interspecific dynamics that are at least as competitive as they are facilitative. The decrease in phylogenetic clustering with elevation suggests that traits that allow persistence in these conditions are convergent at the local scale.",10.1890/ES14-00242.1,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Harrison, S; Cornell, H; Grace, JB",2015,Does natural variation in diversity affect biotic resistance?,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"1. Theories linking diversity to ecosystem function have been challenged by the widespread observation of more exotic species in more diverse native communities. Few studies have addressed the key underlying process by dissecting how community diversity is shaped by the same environmental gradients that determine biotic and abiotic resistance to new invaders. 2. In grasslands on highly heterogeneous soils, we used addition of a recent invader, competitor removal and structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse soil influences on community diversity, biotic and abiotic resistance and invader success. 3. Biotic resistance, measured by reduction in invader success in the presence of the resident community, was negatively correlated with species richness and functional diversity. However, in the multivariate SEM framework, biotic resistance was independent of all forms of diversity and was positively affected by soil fertility via community biomass. Abiotic resistance, measured by invader success in the absence of the resident community, peaked on infertile soils with low biomass and high community diversity. Net invader success was determined by biotic resistance, consistent with this invader's better performance on infertile soils in unmanipulated conditions. 4. Seed predation added slightly to biotic resistance without qualitatively changing the results. Soil-related genotypic variation in the invader also did not affect the results. 5. Synthesis. In natural systems, diversity may be correlated with invasibility and yet have no effect on either biotic or abiotic resistance to invasion. More generally, the environmental causes of variation in diversity should not be overlooked when considering the potential functional consequences of diversity.",10.1111/1365-2745.12439,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Research suggests that disturbance-tolerant taxa may be represented by fungi in the Glomerales, those in culture collections, and by cosmopolitan taxa due to their generalist growth habit. The corollary is that these taxa should be less common in undisturbed systems. Although widely accepted, these ideas originate from research conducted in previously disturbed systems. Whether they hold up to comparisons of disturbed versus undisturbed systems remains to be seen.We addressed this question by surveying logged and intact sites within forests dominated an AM fungal host (western redcedar; Thuja plicata). We predicted that old-growth sites would host fewer taxa from the Glomerales, fewer cultured taxa, and fewer cosmopolitan taxa compared to logged sites.Contrary to our predictions, the logged and intact sites did not differ with respect the putative disturbance-tolerant taxa. However, taxonomic composition differed, driven primarily by variation in relative abundance rather than loss or gain of taxa. Multiple analyses of indicator taxa revealed no consistent indicators of either undisturbed or disturbed habitats.Based on these findings, the current paradigm for a phylogenetically based LHS of AM fungi warrants re-examination.

The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Harze, M; Mahy, G; Monty, A",2016,Functional traits are more variable at the intra- than inter-population level: a study of four calcareous dry-grassland plant species,TUEXENIA,"The majority of studies investigating plant functional traits have used species average trait values, and assumed that average values were sufficiently representative of each species considered. Although this approach has proven valuable in community ecology studies, plant functional traits can significantly vary at different scales, i.e. between but also within populations. The study of species functional trait variability can facilitate increasingly accurate studies in community ecology. Nevertheless, the current extent of within-site plant trait variability has been poorly addressed in the literature. Calcareous grasslands are ecosystems well-suited to study plant trait variation at small spatial scales. Many species are present on heterogeneous calcareous sites, with significant differences in hydric status due to variations in soil depth, soil moisture, aspect, and slope. This study assesses the extent of intra-population functional trait variability and tests the hypothesis that this variability can be explained by within-site environmental heterogeneity. Three functional traits (SLA-specific leaf area, LDMC-leaf dry matter content,. and plant vegetative height) were assessed in three populations of four calcareous grassland species totalling 950 individuals. The heterogeneity in soil depth and potential direct incident radiation was also quantified and related to plant functional trait variability. The intra-population functional trait variability was compared to the inter-population variability of collected data and global inter-population variability data obtained from the worldwide TRY functional traits database. The results showed that SLA, LDMC, and plant height are characterized by considerable intra-population variation (SLA: 72-95%, LDMC: 78-100% and vegetative height: 70-94% of trait variability). The results also indicate higher plant height and larger SLA for individuals located in plots with deeper soils or lower potential direct incident radiation, on gentle slopes or north-facing slopes. Our findings additionally support the concept that higher plant height, higher SLA, and lower LDMC are related to higher availability of soil water. Individuals on shallow soils or in more exposed areas are better equipped to cope with environmental stress. Our results indicate plasticity or local adaptation in individuals to environmental heterogeneity. This study suggests that detailed analyses involving plant functional traits require measurements in situ from a large number of individuals, as the degree of individual response strongly depends on an individual's location and its micro-environmental conditions. Neglecting intra-population trait variability may be critical, as intraspecific variation can be very high at the population scale, and is likely to be driven by local environmental heterogeneity.",10.14471/2016.36.018,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,1,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = SLA, LDMC and height.

"Hauber, ME",2003,Interspecific brood parasitism and the evolution of host clutch sizes,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,"Life-history theory predicts that, over evolutionary time. increased juvenile mortality should decrease parental investment in the number of offspring produced at each breeding attempt. Because interspecific brood parasitism in birds typically reduces the survival of host eggs, nestlings and fledglings, but not that of adult hosts, a specific prediction of the theory is that co-evolution with interspecific brood parasites should lead to smaller avian clutch sizes. Furthermore, the severity of juvenile mortality caused by parasitism in the hosts, due to the parasites' activities and the hosts' rejection behaviours, should correlate negatively with clutch size. In a comparative analysis, both of these predictions were supported among hosts of obligate brood parasitic brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Reduced clutch sizes appeared to be part of a trade-off strategy as parasitism was also associated with more annual breeding attempts. These findings suggest that, on an evolutionary time-scale, hosts' prolonged interactions with interspecific brood parasites lead to reduced clutch sizes at the taxon level and, qualitatively, these changes in life-history traits are similar to those associated with other types of parasitism and diseases whose main effects also lead to reduced juvenile survival.",NA,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,
"Hausmann, Sebastian L.; Tietjen, Britta; Rillig, Matthias C.",2017,Solving the puzzle of yeast survival in ephemeral nectar systems: exponential growth is not enough,FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,"Flower nectar is a sugar-rich ephemeral habitat for microorganisms. Nectar-borne yeasts are part of the microbial community and can affect pollination by changing nectar chemistry, attractiveness to pollinators or flower temperature if yeast population densities are high. Pollinators act as dispersal agents in this system; however, pollination events lead potentially to shrinking nectar yeast populations. We here examine how sufficiently high cell densities of nectar yeast can develop in a flower. In laboratory experiments, we determined the remaining fraction of nectar yeast cells after nectar removal, and used honeybees to determine the number of transmitted yeast cells from one flower to the next. The results of these experiments directly fed into a simulation model providing an insight into movement and colonization ecology of nectar yeasts. We found that cell densities only reached an ecologically relevant size for an intermediate pollination probability. Too few pollination events reduce yeast inoculation rate and too many reduce yeast population size strongly. In addition, nectar yeasts need a trait combination of at least an intermediate growth rate and an intermediate remaining fraction to compensate for highly frequent decimations. Our results can be used to predict nectar yeast dispersal, growth and consequently their ecological effects.",10.1093/femsec/fix150,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models. Future applications include species comparisons, analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to life-history traits, as well as large-scale management intervention and policy assessment.",10.1002/ece3.2765,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Near infrared reflectance spectrometry (NIRS) is a cost-, time-, and sample-effective method of measuring chemical components in organic samples commonly used in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. To assess the applicability of NIRS to measure the ecologically important tissue traits of carbon, nitrogen, and phlorotannins (secondary metabolites) in brown algae, we developed NIRS calibration models for these constituents in dried Sargassum flavicans (F. K. Mertens) C. Agardh tissue. We then tested if the developed NIRS models could detect changes in the tissue composition of S. flavicans induced by experimental manipulation of temperature and nutrient availability. To develop the NIRS models, we used partial least squares regression to determine the statistical relationship between trait values determined in laboratory assays and the NIRS spectral data of S. flavicans calibration samples. Models with high predictive power were developed for all three constituents that successfully detected changes in carbon, nitrogen, and phlorotannin content in the experimentally manipulated S. flavicans tissue. Phlorotannin content in S. flavicans was inversely related to nitrogen availability, and nitrogen, temperature, and tissue age interacted to significantly affect phlorotannin content, demonstrating the importance of studies that investigate these three variables simultaneously. Given the speed of analysis, accuracy, small tissue requirements, and ability to measure multiple traits simultaneously without consuming the sample tissue, NIRS is a valuable alternative to traditional methods for determining algal tissue traits, especially in studies where tissue is limited.",10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00890.x,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Experiment,Marine,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = C, N, phlorotannin concentrations.

C.; Chu, Chengjin",2018,Intra- and interspecific trait variations reveal functional relationships between specific leaf area and soil niche within a subtropical forest,ANNALS OF BOTANY,"Background and Aims How functional traits vary with environmental conditions is of fundamental importance in trait-based community ecology. However, how intraspecific variability in functional traits is connected to species distribution is not well understood. This study investigated inter-and intraspecific variation of a key functional trait, i.e. specific leaf area (leaf area per unit dry mass; SLA), in relation to soil factors and tested if trait variation is more closely associated with specific environmental regimes for low-variability species than for high-variability species.Methods In a subtropical evergreen forest plot (50 ha, southern China), 106 700 leaves from 5335 individuals of 207 woody species were intensively collected, with 30 individuals sampled for most species to ensure a sufficient sample size representative of intraspecific variability. Soil conditions for each plant were estimated by kriging from more than 1700 observational soil locations across the plot. Intra-and interspecific variation in SLA were separately related to environmental factors. Based on the species-specific variation of SLA, species were categorized into three groups: low-, intermediate- and high-intraspecific variability. Intraspecific habitat ranges and the strength of SLA-habitat relationships were compared among these three groups.Key Results Interspecific variation in SLA overrides the intraspecific variation (77 % vs. 8 %). Total soil nitrogen (TN, positively) and total organic carbon (TOC, negatively) are the most important explanatory factors for SLA variation at both intra-and interspecific levels. SLA, both within and between species, decreases with decreasing soil nitrogen availability. As predicted, species with low intraspecific variability in SLA have narrower habitat ranges with respect to soil TOC and TN and show a stronger SLA-habitat association than high-variability species.Conclusions For woody plants low SLA is a phenotypic and probably adaptive response to nitrogen stress, which drives the predominance of species with ever-decreasing SLA towards less fertile habitats. Intraspecific variability in SLA is positively connected to species' niche breadth, suggesting that low-variability species may play a more deterministic role in structuring plant assemblages than high-variability species. This study highlights the importance of quantifying intraspecific trait variation to improve our understanding of species distributions across a vegetated landscape.",10.1093/aob/mcx222,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Observational,Terrestrial,Plants,Subtropical evergreen forest,0,1,0,0,0,Morphological,1,1,0,0,1,,0,F,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = SLA,
"He, JX; Stewart, DJ",2001,Age and size at first reproduction of fishes: Predictive models based only on growth trajectories,ECOLOGY,"Age and size at first reproduction have broad implications for studying population and community ecology. From general functions of body growth we developed models for estimating both age and size at first reproduction when growth trajectories are the only reliable information. We evaluated our models using empirical data, including 85 species of marine and freshwater fishes, with 235 populations or sex groups. From the data set, we found the following two sets of relations. (1) There is a nonlinear negative relation between the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (K) and the age at first reproduction (T-r). (2) The ratio of body length at first reproduction (L-r) to asymptotic body length (L-inf) may increase in two possible ways: one is increases in K and, consequently, decreases in L-inf; the other is increases in T-r and delay of the age at first reproduction. Our model integrates the above complex relations into a simple linear function. The set of life-history invariants summarized by E. Charnov and by A. L. Jensen is a special case of our model. The pattern of life-history diversification demonstrated by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose is similar to our model implication and the results of our data analysis. Additional information about other complex traits such as mortality and fecundity are not needed in our models, so our models provide an independent basis for testing life-history theories and for applying those theories to modeling population dynamics.",10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0784:AASAFR]2.0.CO;2,N,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,,,,,,0,,,

Despite decades of research, controversy has emerged as to whether positive and negative interactions predictably shift with increasing environmental stress as hypothesised by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH). Here, we provide a synthesis of 727 tests of the SGH in plant communities across the globe to examine its generality across a variety of ecological factors. Our results show that plant interactions change with stress through an outright shift to facilitation (survival) or a reduction in competition (growth and reproduction). In a limited number of cases, plant interactions do not respond to stress, but they never shift towards competition with stress. These findings are consistent across stress types, plant growth forms, life histories, origins (invasive vs. native), climates, ecosystems and methodologies, though the magnitude of the shifts towards facilitation with stress is dependent on these factors. We suggest that future studies should employ standardised definitions and protocols to test the SGH, take a multi-factorial approach that considers variables such as plant traits in addition to stress, and apply the SGH to better understand how species and communities will respond to environmental change.",10.1111/ele.12080,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Metanalysis,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Life History,1,1,0,1,,,0,E,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = growth form (non‐vascular, herb, grass, shrub and tree, for target and neighbour plants respectively), life history (annual, juvenile perennial and adult perennial) and origin (native vs. exotic)",

The vast majority of diversity on reefs is comprised of small invertebrates that live within the reef structure, termed the cryptofauna. This component of biodiversity is hugely understudied, and many species remain undescribed. This study represents a rare analysis of assembly processes structuring a distinct group of cryptofauna, the Palaemonidae, in the Chagos Archipelago, a reef ecosystem under minimal direct human impacts in the central Indian Ocean. The Palaemonidae are a diverse group of Caridae (infraorder of shrimps) that inhabit many different niches on coral reefs and are of particular interest because of their varied habitat associations. Phylogenetic and trait diversity and phylogenetic signal were used to infer likely drivers of community structure. The mechanisms driving palaemonid community assembly and maintenance in the Chagos Archipelago showed distinct spatial patterns. At local scales, among coral colonies and among reefs fringing individual atolls, significant trait, and phylogenetic clustering patterns suggest environmental filtering may be a dominant ecological process driving Palaemonidae community structure, although local competition through equalizing mechanisms may also play a role in shaping the local community structure. Importantly, we also tested the robustness of phylogenetic diversity to changes in evolutionary information as multi-gene phylogenies are resource intensive and for large families, such as the Palaemonidae, are often incomplete. These tests demonstrated a very modest impact on phylogenetic community structure, with only one of the four genes (PEPCK gene) in the phylogeny affecting phylogenetic diversity patterns, which provides useful information for future studies on large families with incomplete phylogenies. These findings contribute to our limited knowledge of this component of biodiversity in a marine locality as close to undisturbed by humans as can be found.

Yet, potency and the amount of venom available varies greatly across species, ranging from the seemingly harmless to those capable of killing vast numbers of potential prey. This variation is poorly understood, with comparative approaches confounded by the use of atypical prey species as models to measure venom potency. Here, we account for such confounding issues by incorporating the phylogenetic similarity between a snake's diet and the species used to measure its potency. In a comparative analysis of 102 species we show that snake venom potency is generally prey-specific. We also show that venom yields are lower in species occupying three dimensional environments and increases with body size corresponding to metabolic rate, but faster than predicted from increases in prey size.

Organismal morphology, body stoichiometry, and physiology can be readily linked to large scale ecosystem processes through functional traits that inform on interspecific and species environment interactions; yet such effect traits are still poorly included in trait based approaches. Given their key trophic position in aquatic ecosystems, individual zooplankton affect energy fluxes and elemental processing. We compiled a large database of zooplankton traits contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling and examined the effect of classification and habitat (marine vs. freshwater) on trait relationships. Respiration and nutrient excretion rates followed mass dependent scaling in both habitats, with exponents ranging from 0.70 to 0.90. Our analyses revealed surprising differences in allometry and respiration between habitats, with freshwater species having lower length-specific mass and three times higher mass specific respiration rates. These differences in traits point to implications for ecological strategies as well as overall carbon storage and fluxes based on habitat type.

In this study, DNA barcodes for the two widely used plastid coding regions rbcL and matK are used to contribute to identification of morphologically undetermined individuals, as well as to investigate phylogenetic structure of tree communities in 70 subplots (10 x 10m) of a 25-ha forest-dynamics plot in Brunei (Borneo, Southeast Asia). The combined matrix (rbcL + matK) comprised 555 haplotypes (from >= 154 genera, 68 families and 25 orders sensu APG, Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2016), making a substantial contribution to tree barcode sequences from Southeast Asia. Barcode sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using maximum likelihood, both with and without constraining the topology of taxonomic orders to match that proposed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. A third phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the program Phylomatic to investigate the influence of phylogenetic resolution on results. Detection of non-random patterns of community assembly was determined by net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI). In most cases, community assembly was either random or phylogenetically clustered, which likely indicates the importance to community structure of habitat filtering based on phylogenetically correlated traits in determining community structure. Different phylogenetic trees gave similar overall results, but the Phylomatic tree produced greater variation across plots for NRI and NTI values, presumably due to noise introduced by using an unresolved phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that using a DNA barcode tree has benefits over the traditionally used Phylomatic approach by increasing precision and accuracy and allowing the incorporation of taxonomically unidentified individuals into analyses.",10.1371/journal.pone.0185861,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Hedges, SB; Conn, CE",2012,"A new skink fauna from Caribbean islands (Squamata, Mabuyidae, Mabuyinae)",ZOOTAXA,"Neotropical skinks are unique among lizards and other vertebrates in their degree of convergence, in reproductive traits, with eutherian mammals. They have also been famously difficult to classify into species, largely because of a conservative body plan and paucity of conventional diagnostic characters. Currently there are 26 recognized species, six of which occur only on Caribbean islands. All are placed in a single genus, Mabuya. We conducted a systematic revision of Neotropical skinks using both conventional and unconventional morphological characters, supplemented by DNA sequence analyses. We define 61 species grouped into 16 clades, recognized here as genera. They include three available generic names (Copeoglossum, Mabuya, and Spondylurus) and 13 new genera: Alinea gen. nov., Aspronema gen. nov., Brasiliscincus gen. nov., Capitellum gen. nov., Exila gen. nov., Manciola gen. nov., Maracaiba gen. nov., Marisora gen. nov., c gen. nov., Orosaura gen. nov., Panopa gen. nov., Psychosaura gen. nov., and Varzea gen. nov. These 16 genera of skinks form a monophyletic group and are placed in the Subfamily Mabuyinae of the skink Family Mabuyidae. Six other skink families are recognized: Acontidae, Egerniidae, Eugongylidae, Lygosomidae, Scincidae, and Sphenomorphidae. We describe three new subfamilies of Mabuyidae: Chioniniinae subfam. nov., Dasiinae subfam. nov., and Trachyl-epidinae subfam. nov. We describe 24 new species of mabuyines: Capitellum mariagalantae sp. nov., Capitellum parvicruzae sp. nov., Copeoglossum aurae sp. nov., Copeoglossum margaritae sp. nov., Copeoglossum redondae sp. nov., Mabuya cochonae sp. nov., Mabuya desiradae sp. nov., Mabuya grandisterrae sp. nov., Mabuya guadeloupae sp. nov., Mabuya hispaniolae sp. nov., Mabuya montserratae sp. nov., Marisora aurulae sp. nov., Marisora magnacornae sp. nov., Marisora roatanae sp. nov., Spondylurus anegadae sp. nov., Spondylurus culebrae sp. nov., Spondylurus caicosae sp. nov., Spondylurus haitiae sp. nov., Spondylurus magnacruzae sp. nov., Spondylurus martinae sp. nov., Spondylurus monae sp. nov., Spondylurus monitae sp. nov., Spondylurus powelli sp. nov., and Spondylurus turksae sp. nov. We also resurrect 10 species from synonymies: Alinea lanceolata comb. nov., Alinea luciae comb. nov., Capitellum metallicum comb. nov., Mabuya dominicana, Marisora alliacea comb. nov., Marisora brachypoda comb. nov., Spondylurus fulgidus comb. nov., Spondylurus nitidus comb. nov., Spondylurus semitaeniatus comb. nov., and Spondylurus spilonotus comb. nov. Of the 61 total species of mabuyine skinks, 39 occur on Caribbean islands, 38 are endemic to those islands, and 33 of those occur in the West Indies. Most species on Caribbean islands are allopatric, single-island endemics, although three species are known from Hispaniola, three from St. Thomas, and two from Culebra, St. Croix, Salt Island, Martinique, the southern Lesser Antilles, Trinidad, and Tobago. Co-occurring species typically differ in body size and belong to different genera. Three ecomorphs are described to account for associations of ecology and morphology: terrestrial, scansorial, and cryptozoic. Parturition occurs at the transition between the dry and wet seasons, and the number of young (1-7) is correlated with body size and taxonomic group. Molecular phylogenies indicate the presence of many unnamed species in Middle and South America. A molecular timetree shows that mabuyines dispersed from Africa to South America 18 (25-9) million years ago, and that diversification occurred initially in South America but soon led to colonization of Caribbean islands and Middle America. The six genera present on Caribbean islands each represent separate dispersals, over water, from the mainland during the last 10 million years. Considerable dispersal and speciation also occurred on and among Caribbean islands, probably enhanced by Pleistocene glacial cycles and their concomitant sea level changes. Based on IUCN Redlist criteria, all of the 38 endemic Caribbean island species are threatened with extinction. Twenty-seven species (71%) are Critically Endangered, six species (16%) are Endangered, and five species (13%) are Vulnerable. Sixteen of the Critically Endangered species are extinct, or possibly extinct, because of human activities during the last two centuries. Several of the surviving species are near extinction and in need of immediate protection. Analysis of collection records indicates that the decline or loss of 14 skink species can be attributed to predation by the Small Indian Mongoose. That invasive predator was introduced as a biological control of rats in sugar cane fields in the late nineteenth century (1872-1900), immediately resulting in a mass extinction of skinks and other reptiles. The ground-dwelling and diurnal habits of skinks have made them particularly susceptible to mongoose predation.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Heerah, K; Woillez, M; Fablet, R; Garren, F; Martin, S; De Pontual, H",2017,Coupling spectral analysis and hidden Markov models for the segmentation of behavioural patterns,MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,"Background: Movement pattern variations are reflective of behavioural switches, likely associated with different life history traits in response to the animals' abiotic and biotic environment. Detecting these can provide rich information on the underlying processes driving animal movement patterns. However, extracting these signals from movement time series, requires tools that objectively extract, describe and quantify these behaviours. The inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns has been mainly addressed through hidden Markov models. Until now, the metrics implemented in these models did not allow to characterize cyclic patterns directly from the raw time series. To address these challenges, we developed an approach to i) extract new metrics of cyclic behaviours and activity levels from a time-frequency analysis of movement time series, ii) implement the spectral signatures of these cyclic patterns and activity levels into a HMM framework to identify and classify latent behavioural states. Results: To illustrate our approach, we applied it to 40 high-resolution European sea bass depth time series. Our results showed that the fish had different activity regimes, which were also associated (or not) with the spectral signature of different environmental cycles. Tidal rhythms were observed when animals tended to be less active and dived shallower. Conversely, animals exhibited a diurnal behaviour when more active and deeper in the water column. The different behaviours were well defined and occurred at similar periods throughout the annual cycle amongst individuals, suggesting these behaviours are likely related to seasonal functional behaviours (e.g. feeding, migrating and spawning). Conclusions: The innovative aspects of our method lie within the combined use of powerful, but generic, mathematical tools (spectral analysis and hidden Markov Models) to extract complex behaviours from 1-D movement time series. It is fully automated which makes it suitable for analyzing large datasets. HMMs also offer the flexibility to include any additional variable in the segmentation process (e.g. environmental features, location coordinates). Thus, our method could be widely applied in the bio-logging community and contribute to prime issues in movement ecology (e.g. habitat requirements and selection, site fidelity and dispersal) that are crucial to inform mitigation, management and conservation strategies.",10.1186/s40462-017-0111-3,Y,0,1,0,0,0,1,Multiple,Marine,Fish,Continental Shelf,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = activity level, ",

The EMS approach has very rarely been applied in the context of a comparative analysis of metacommunity types of main microbial, plant, and animal groups. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no study has associated metacommunity types with their potential ecological correlates in the freshwater realm. We assembled data for 45 freshwater metacommunities, incorporating biologically highly disparate organismal groups (i.e., bacteria, algae, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish). We first examined ecological correlates (e.g., matrix properties, beta diversity, and average characteristics of a metacommunity, including body size, trophic group, ecosystem type, life form, and dispersal mode) of the three elements of metacommunity structure (i.e., coherence, turnover, and boundary clumping). Second, based on those three elements, we determined which metacommunity types prevailed in freshwater systems and which ecological correlates best discriminated among the observed metacommunity types. We found that the three elements of metacommunity structure were not strongly related to the ecological correlates, except that turnover was positively related to beta diversity. We observed six metacommunity types. The most common were Clementsian and quasi-nested metacommunity types, whereas Random, quasi-Clementsian, Gleasonian, and quasi-Gleasonian types were less common. These six metacommunity types were best discriminated by beta diversity and the first axis of metacommunity ecological traits, ranging from metacommunities of producer organisms occurring in streams to those of large predatory organisms occurring in lakes.

Such multi-facet community assembly studies are, however, rare in the freshwater realm. We examined the responses of species richness, functional alpha diversity and phylogenetic alpha diversity of littoral macroinvertebrates to environmental gradients in near-pristine boreal lakes. We also examined community assembly mechanisms using null models of functional or phylogenetic clustering, overdispersion and randomness as indications of different assembly mechanisms. We found that the alpha diversity indices examined responded differently to the underlying environmental gradients. Also, phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity indices showed different levels of overdispersion, clustering and randomness, which also varied slightly between the analyses based on abundance and presence-absence data. These results suggested that different alpha diversity indices may provide different information about overdispersion (e.g. caused by biotic interactions) and clustering (e.g. caused by environmental filtering), and emphasised the fact that most individual lakes were inhabited by species that were merely random draws from the functional or phylogenetic species pools available in the study region. Our findings suggested that some individual lakes are assembled by deterministic mechanisms, including environmental filtering and biotic interactions, whereas most individual lake macroinvertebrate communities constitute random draws from the regional species pool or are affected by the antagonistic effects of different assembly processes.

Theory suggests climate change is an increasingly stressful environment, predicting extinctions or decreased abundances. However, if favourable conditions align, such as an increase in resources or release from competition and predation, future climate can fuel population growth. Tests of such population growth models and the mechanisms by which they are enabled are rare. We tested whether intergenerational increases in population size might be facilitated by adjustments in reproductive success to favourable environmental conditions in a large-scale mesocosm experiment. Herbivorous amphipod populations responded to future climate by increasing 20 fold, suggesting that future climate might relax environmental constraints on fecundity. We then assessed whether future climate reduces variation in mating success, boosting population fecundity and size. The proportion of gravid females doubled, and variance in phenotypic variation of male secondary sexual characters (i.e. gnathopods) was significantly reduced. While future climate can enhance individual growth and survival, it may also reduce constraints on mechanisms of reproduction such that enhanced intra-generational productivity and reproductive success transfers to subsequent generations.

We surveyed 147 vegetation plots across a chronosequence of 22 restored semi-natural grassland patches to quantify the effects of spatial isolation on both plant species and plant trait assembly. Trait level assembly was analysed using an emergent group approach, based on 28 functional plant traits. Additionally, we examined the effects of several dispersal-related plant traits on species recolonization capacities. Whereas total plant species richness of the restoration patches did not change through space or through time, progressing assembly was found to consist of a sequential replacement of generalist species with specialist species, which was reflected by a directional assembly at the plant trait level. Grassland isolation was found to slow down community assembly at both the species and the trait level without changing the general direction of assembly. This slowdown became less pronounced with increasing time since restoration. Spatial isolation of the restoration patches was found to act as a trait filter, independent of assembly age. We found a proportionally higher occurrence of species with light seeds and a high seed attachment potential in more isolated restoration patches, suggesting that colonization is more limited in isolated grasslands. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that the assembly process, at both the species and the trait level, is influenced by the position of the restoration patch in the landscape. Monitoring schemes following ecological restoration should therefore include the spatial context of the system while using both a trait-based and a species-based plant community analysis. Successful restoration requires physically interconnecting grassland fragments and probably the introduction of seeds or seedlings of species with low dispersability.",10.1111/1365-2664.12037,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits =(delineation of emergent groups = plant height

Specifically, we modeled and mapped species-level biomass for 92 large mammal herbivores using census data, species distributions, and environmental covariates. Trait-based classifications of these species into herbivore functional types, and analyses of their biomass surfaces, reveal four ecologically distinct continental-scale herbivory regimes, characterized by internally similar forms and intensities of herbivory pressure.

We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; microhabitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation.

Further, the resulting sexual dimorphism can differ between populations adapted to different environments, or among individuals developing under different environmental conditions. In the nine-spine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), males perform nest building, courtship, territory defence and parental care, whereas females perform mate choice and produce eggs. Also, predation-adapted marine and competition-adapted pond populations have diverged in a series of ecologically relevant traits, including the level of phenotypic plasticity. Here, we studied sexual dimorphism in brain size and architecture in nine-spined stickleback from marine and pond populations reared in a factorial experiment with predation and food treatments in a common garden experiment. Males had relatively larger brains, larger telencephala, cerebella and hypothalami (6-16% divergence) than females, irrespective of habitat. Females tended to have larger bulbi olfactorii than males (13%) in the high food treatment, whereas no such difference was found in the low food treatment. The strong sexual dimorphism in brain architecture implies that the different reproductive allocation strategies (behaviour vs. egg production) select for different investments into the costly brains between males and females. The lack of habitat dependence in brain sexual dimorphism suggests that the sex-specific selection forces on brains differ only negligibly between habitats. Although significance of the observed sex-specific brain plasticity in the size of bulbus olfactorius remains unclear, it demonstrates the potential for sex-specific neural plasticity.",10.1111/jeb.12409,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

For the perennial Helleborus foetidus, we measured functional leaf traits to quantify the contribution of within-plant variation to intraspecific functional variance and evaluate whether within-plant variability itself deserves separate consideration. Methods: Within-individual variation in eight leaf traits was quantified for 138 plants sampled from 10 widely spaced locations in the Sierra de Cazorla, southeastern Spain. An amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to look for associations between within-plant variability and specific AFLP markers. Key results: Leaflets from basal positions in ramets were longer, heavier, had greater surface area and larger stomata, and lower specific area, stomatal index, and stomatal density than those from distal positions. Continuous variation between leaves from the same ramet was the main source of population-wide variance for most traits. Within-plant variability differed among populations. Individuals differed in within-plant variability, which was largely independent of trait means and associated with genetic characteristics. Up to four AFLP markers were associated with the within-plant variability level of a given leaf trait. Conclusions: Subindividual variability in continuous leaf traits was independent of plant means and related to genetic features. The within-individual component generally exceeded the between-individual component of intraspecific variance. Within-plant variation may broaden the ecological breadth and enhance stability and persistence of plant populations and communities and may provide novel insights when incorporated in trait-based community ecology models.",10.3732/ajb.1400437,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = leaflet total area, max length, max width, specific area, tomatal density, area independent stomatal index, stomatal length",

This study tested the effects of habitat, phylogenetic and phenotypic trait predictors on species co-occurrence patterns and abundances, with the endemic primates of Madagascar as an empirical system. The abundance of 11 primate species was estimated along gradients of elevation, food resource abundance and anthropogenic habitat disturbance at local scales in south-east Madagascar. Community composition was compared to null models to test for phylogenetic and functional structure, and the effects of phylogenetic relatedness of co-occurring species, their trait similarity and environmental variables on species' abundances were tested using mixed models and quantile regressions. Resource abundance was the strongest predictor of community structure. Where food tree abundance was high, closely related species with similar traits dominated communities. High-elevation communities with lower food tree abundance consisted of species that were distantly related and had divergent traits. Closely related species had dissimilar abundances where they co-occurred, partially driven by trait dissimilarity, indicating character displacement. By integrating local-scale variation in primate community composition, evolutionary relatedness and functional diversity, this study found strong evidence that community assembly in this system can be explained by competition and character displacement along ecological gradients.",10.1111/1365-2656.12532,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,no traits,

To better understand the invasive ecology of species in New England, USA, we compiled a character data set with which to compare non-native species that are known invaders to non-native species that are not currently known to be invasive. In contrast to previous biological trait-based models, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to identify sets of plant traits associated with invasiveness for each of three growth forms (vines, shrubs, and trees). The resulting models identify a suite of 'invasive traits' highlighting the ecology associated with invasiveness for each of three growth forms. The most effective predictors of invasiveness that emerged from our model were 'invasive elsewhere', 'fast growth rate', 'native latitudinal range', and 'growth form'. The contrast among growth forms was pronounced. For example, 'wind dispersal' was positively correlated with invasiveness in trees, but negatively correlated in shrubs and vines. The predictive model was able to correctly classify invasive plants 67% of the time (22/33), and non-invasive plants 95% of the time (204/215).

"Heymans, JJ; Coll, M; Libralato, S; Morissette, L; Christensen, V",2014,Global Patterns in Ecological Indicators of Marine Food Webs: A Modelling Approach,PLOS ONE,"Background: Ecological attributes estimated from food web models have the potential to be indicators of good environmental status given their capabilities to describe redundancy, food web changes, and sensitivity to fishing. They can be used as a baseline to show how they might be modified in the future with human impacts such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, or overfishing. Methodology: In this study ecological network analysis indicators of 105 marine food web models were tested for variation with traits such as ecosystem type, latitude, ocean basin, depth, size, time period, and exploitation state, whilst also considering structural properties of the models such as number of linkages, number of living functional groups or total number of functional groups as covariate factors. Principal findings: Eight indicators were robust to model construction: relative ascendency; relative overhead; redundancy; total systems throughput (TST); primary production/TST; consumption/TST; export/TST; and total biomass of the community. Large-scale differences were seen in the ecosystems of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with the Western Atlantic being more complex with an increased ability to mitigate impacts, while the Eastern Atlantic showed lower internal complexity. In addition, the Eastern Pacific was less organised than the Eastern Atlantic although both of these systems had increased primary production as eastern boundary current systems. Differences by ecosystem type highlighted coral reefs as having the largest energy flow and total biomass per unit of surface, while lagoons, estuaries, and bays had lower transfer efficiencies and higher recycling. These differences prevailed over time, although some traits changed with fishing intensity. Keystone groups were mainly higher trophic level species with mostly top-down effects, while structural/dominant groups were mainly lower trophic level groups (benthic primary producers such as seagrass and macroalgae, and invertebrates). Keystone groups were prevalent in estuarine or small/shallow systems, and in systems with reduced fishing pressure. Changes to the abundance of key functional groups might have significant implications for the functioning of ecosystems and should be avoided through management. Conclusion/significance: Our results provide additional understanding of patterns of structural and functional indicators in different ecosystems. Ecosystem traits such as type, size, depth, and location need to be accounted for when setting reference levels as these affect absolute values of ecological indicators. Therefore, establishing absolute reference values for ecosystem indicators may not be suitable to the ecosystem-based, precautionary approach. Reference levels for ecosystem indicators should be developed for individual ecosystems or ecosystems with the same typologies (similar location, ecosystem type, etc.) and not benchmarked against all other ecosystems.",10.1371/journal.pone.0095845,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,"didn't look at species traits, just pulled traits of functional groups from the food web models",
"Hidasi-Neto, J; Barlow, J; Cianciaruso, MV",2012,Bird functional diversity and wildfires in the Amazon: the role of forest structure,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,"Fire is becoming a common phenomenon in Amazonian forest, modifying the structure and composition of natural assemblages. In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 19971998 El-Nino period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest.",10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00528.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Birds,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = body size, foraging method, foraging substrate, diet.

Populations of Speyeria butterflies across North America have declined and Speyeria adiaste is an imperiled species endemic to the southern California Coast Ranges. In this paper, we study the link between the food plant Viola purpurea quercetorum and abundance of its herbivore Speyeria adiaste clemencei to better understand the butterfly's decline and aid in restoration of this and other Speyeria species. To assess the degree to which the larval food plant limits adult abundance of S. a. clemencei in 2013, we compared adult population counts to population size predicted from a Monte Carlo simulation using data for number of V. pur. quercetorum plants, number of leaves per plant, and leaf area per plant, with lab estimates of leaf area consumed to reach pupal stage on the non-native host V. papilionacea. Results indicated an average estimate of 765 pupae (median = 478), with 77% of the distribution being <1000 pupae. However, this was heavily dependent on plant distribution, and accounting for the number of transect segments with sufficient host to support a pupa predicted 371 pupae. The adult population empirical estimate was 227 individuals (95% CI is 146 to 392), which lies near the first quartile of the simulated distribution. These results indicate that the amount of host available to larvae was more closely linked to adult abundance than the amount of host present, especially when considering assumptions of the analyses. The data also indicate that robust populations require host density well in excess of what is eaten by larvae, in combination with appropriate spacing, to mitigate factors such as competition, starvation from leaving host patches, or unrelated to food plant, such as mortality from drought, predators, parasites, or disease.",10.3390/insects9040179,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Cooperative breeding theory provides a rich framework with which to study the factors that may influence the costs and benefits of remaining philopatric as a non-breeder. This is often viewed as an initial step in the development of costly helping behavior provided by non-breeding subordinates. Despite many excellent empirical studies testing key concepts of the theory, there is still debate regarding the relative importance of various evolutionary forces, suggesting that there may not be a general explanation but rather a dynamic and taxonomically varied combination of factors influencing the evolution and maintenance of sociality. Here, we explore two potential improvements in the study of sociality that could aid in the progress of this field. The first addresses the fact that empirical studies of social evolution are typically conducted using either comparative, observational or manipulative methodologies. Instead, we suggest a holistic approach, whereby observational and experimental studies are designed with the explicit view of advancing comparative analyses of sociality for the taxon, and in tandem, where comparative work informs targeted research effort on specific ( usually understudied) species within the lineage. A second improvement relates to the broadening of tests of cooperative breeding theory to include taxa where subordinates do not necessarily provide active cooperation within the group. The original bias toward ""helpful subordinates"" arose from a focus on terrestrial taxa. However, recent consideration of other taxa, especially marine taxa, is slowly revealing that the theory can and should encompass a continuum of cooperative social systems, including those where subordinates do not actively help. This review summarizes the major hypotheses of cooperative breeding theory, one of the dominant frameworks to examine social evolution, and highlights the potential benefits that a combined methodological approach and a broader application could provide to the study of sociality.",10.3389/fevo.2017.00100,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The relative importance of these natural selective forces in the evolution of avian embryonic developmental period (EDP) remain poorly resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus on a single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes. The marine bird families Alcidae (auks) and Spheniscidae (penguins) exhibit marked variation in EDP, as well as behavioural and ecological traits ultimately linked to EDP. Therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a key life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relative importance of behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in the evolution of avian EDP.Results: Three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition and predation risk (i.e., clutch size, activity pattern, and nesting habits) were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and penguin EDP based on models predicting EDP from egg mass. Species with larger clutch sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and open nests had significantly shorter EDPs. Further, EDP was found to be longer among birds which forage in distant offshore waters, relative to those that foraged in near shore waters, in line with our predictions, but not significantly so.Conclusion: Current debate has emphasized predation as the primary agent of selection driving avian life history diversification. Our results suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective forces in the evolution of auk and penguin EDP, and highlight the importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic scales. We suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups will continue to constructively inform the debate on evolutionary determinants of avian EDP, as well as other life history parameters.",10.1186/1471-2148-10-179,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Hoare, JM; Monks, A; O'Donnell, CFJ",2012,Can correlated population trends among forest bird species be predicted by similarity in traits?,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Context. Many conservation decisions rely on the assumption that multiple populations will respond similarly to management. However, few attempts have been made to evaluate correlated population responses to management or to identify traits that could be used to predict correlations. These assumptions are central to the use of the 'population indicator-species concept' (the idea that population trends of one species can be used as an index of trends in other species) for measuring the effects of key ecological drivers. Aims. We investigated correlations among bird population trends in a mixed podocarp-hardwood forest in New Zealand in which introduced mammalian pests are controlled. We analysed trends in the abundance of 18 bird species (primarily passerines) over a 10-year period, using data from 5-min bird counts. Methods. We used a Bayesian modelling approach to identify short-term correlations in population trends among species and to investigate whether ecological traits can be used to predict these correlated trends. Key results. Population increases were detected in 9 of the 18 bird species over the 10-year period of the study. Population trends were correlated for 10% of species pairs (of which 81% were positive correlations). Correlations among seven of the nine species that increased in abundance were always positive; these species form a potential indicator pool. However, traits were not useful for predicting correlated population trends. Conclusions. Bird species affected by a shared ecological driver (predation) can exhibit correlated population trends when introduced predators are controlled, but correlations cannot be predicted by similarity in ecological traits.

We investigated such traits for 34 taxa in seven genera, using analyses of residuals to correct for effects of e.g. female body mass and egg mass on other life history traits. Both tree- and K-means clustering, based on four traits excluding chick provisioning mode, identified two groups of terns - those that breed on tropical oceanic islands and those that breed along mainland coasts and at temperate islands (>40degrees from the Equator). Among mainland terns, there is a tendency for reduced clutch investment at low latitudes both between and within species. There is no interspecific latitudinal variation in incubation or fledging period of these terns, but intraspecific variation in fledging period (longer in the tropics) has been reported for one species. Tropical island terns, which mostly breed at sites lacking native ground predators, show extreme clutch reduction and lay a single, relatively large egg that has a long incubation period. Fledging periods are also long, despite the fact that these are the only terns to use multiple prey loading or regurgitation to feed their chicks. These patterns are interpreted as responses to low food availability stemming from a combination of low oceanic productivity, high bird densities because of breeding space limitation and localised prey depletion associated with central place foraging.",10.2989/00306520309485376,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = Breeding distribution and habitat, female body mass, egg

H.",2017,Emergence of microbial diversity due to cross-feeding interactions in a spatial model of gut microbial metabolism.,BMC Systems Biology,"Background: The human gut contains approximately 1014 bacteria, belonging to hundreds of different species. Together, these microbial species form a complex food web that can break down nutrient sources that our own digestive enzymes cannot handle, including complex polysaccharides, producing short chain fatty acids and additional metabolites, e.g., vitamin K. Microbial diversity is important for colonic health: Changes in the composition of the microbiota have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity and Crohn's disease, and make the microbiota more vulnerable to infestation by harmful species, e.g., Clostridium difficile. To get a grip on the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut, we here propose a multi-scale, spatiotemporal dynamic flux-balance analysis model to study the emergence of metabolic diversity in a spatial gut-like, tubular environment. The model features genome-scale metabolic models (GEM) of microbial populations, resource sharing via extracellular metabolites, and spatial population dynamics and evolution. Results: In this model, cross-feeding interactions emerge readily, despite the species' ability to metabolize sugars autonomously. Interestingly, the community requires cross-feeding for producing a realistic set of short-chain fatty acids from an input of glucose, If we let the composition of the microbial subpopulations change during invasion of adjacent space, a complex and stratified microbiota evolves, with subspecies specializing on cross-feeding interactions via a mechanism of compensated trait loss. The microbial diversity and stratification collapse if the flux through the gut is enhanced to mimic diarrhea. Conclusions: In conclusion, this in silico model is a helpful tool in systems biology to predict and explain the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut. It can be extended to include, e.g., complex nutrient sources, and host-microbiota interactions via the intestinal wall.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Hof, Anouschka R.; Rodriguez-Castaneda, Genoveva; Allen, Andrew M.; Jansson, Roland; Nilsson, Christer",2017,Vulnerability of Subarctic and Arctic breeding birds,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Recent research predicts that future climate change will result in substantial biodiversity loss associated with loss of habitat for species. However, the magnitude of the anticipated biodiversity impacts are less well known. Studies of species vulnerability to climate change through species distribution models are often limited to assessing the extent of species' exposure to the consequences of climate change to their local environment, neglecting species sensitivity to global change. The likelihood that species or populations will decline or go extinct due to climate change also depends on the general sensitivity and adaptive capacity of species. Hence, analyses should also obtain more accurate assessments of their vulnerability. We-addressed this by constructing a vulnerability matrix for 180 bird species currently breeding in Subarctic and Arctic Europe that integrates a climatic exposure-based vulnerability index and a natural-history trait-based vulnerability index. Species that may need extra conservation-attention based on our matrix include the Great Snipe (Gallinago media), the Rough-legged Buzzard (Buteo lagopus), the Red-throated Pipit (Anthus cervinus), the Common Swift (Apus apus), the Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris), and the Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica). Our vulnerability matrix stresses the importance of looking beyond exposure to climate change when species conservation is the aim. For the species that scored high in our matrix the future in the region looks grim and targeted conservation actions, incorporating macroecological and global perspectives, may be needed to alleviate severe population declines. We further demonstrate that climate change is predicted to significantly reduce the current breeding range of species adapted to cold climates in Subarctic and Arctic Europe.

"Holdaway, RJ; Sparrow, AD",2006,Assembly rules operating along a primary riverbed-grassland successional sequence,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"1 Assembly rules are broadly defined as any filter imposed on a regional species pool that acts to determine the local community structure and composition. Environmental filtering is thought to result in the formation of groups of species with similar traits that tend to co-occur more often than expected by chance alone, known as Beta guilds. At a smaller scale, within a single Beta guild, species may be partitioned into Alpha guilds - groups of species that have similar resource use and hence should tend not to co-occur at small scales due the principle of limiting similarity. 2 This research investigates the effects of successional age and the presence of an invasive exotic species on Alpha and Beta guild structuring within plant communities along two successional river terrace sequences in the Waimakariri braided river system in New Zealand. 3 Fifteen sites were sampled, six with and nine without the Russel lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus), an invasive exotic species. At each site, species presence/absence was recorded in 100 circular quadrats (5 cm in diameter) at 30-cm intervals along a 30-m transect. Guild proportionality (Alpha guild structuring) was tested for using two a priori guild classifications each containing three guilds, and cluster analysis was used to test for environmental structuring between sites. 4 Significant assembly rules based on Alpha guild structuring were found, particularly for the monocot and dicot guild. Guild proportionality increased with increasing ecological age, which indicated an increase in the relative importance of competitive structuring at later stages of succession. This provides empirical support for Weiher and Keddy's theoretical model of community assembly. 5 Lupins were associated with altered Alpha and Beta guild structuring at early mid successional sites. Lupin-containing sites had higher silt content than sites without lupins, and this could have altered the strength and scale of competitive structuring within the communities present. 6 This research adds to the increasing evidence for the existence of assembly rules based on limiting similarity within plant communities, and demonstrates the need to incorporate gradients of environmental and competitive adversity when investigating the rules that govern community assembly.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01170.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,didn't use traits explicitly to determine the beta guilds,

Specifically, theory predicts that local adaptation in functionally matched traits of predators and prey will not be detected when coevolution is governed by escalating arms races, whereas it will be present when coevolution occurs through an alternate mechanism of phenotype matching. Here, we analyse local adaptation in venom activity and prey resistance across 12 populations of Northern Pacific rattle snakes and California ground squirrels, an interaction that has often been described as an arms race. Assays of venom function and squirrel resistance show substantial geographical variation (influenced by site elevation) in both venom metalloproteinase activity and resistance factor effectiveness. We demonstrate local adaptation in the effectiveness of rattlesnake venom to overcoming present squirrel resistance, suggesting that phenotype matching plays a role in the coevolution of these molecular traits. Further, the predator was the locally adapted antagonist in this interaction, arguing that rattlesnakes are evolutionarily ahead of their squirrel prey.

However, while evolutionary and functional studies on venom have been extensive, little is known about the molecular basis, variation, and complexity of venom resistance. We review known mechanisms of venom resistance and relate these mechanisms to their predicted impact on coevolutionary dynamics with venomous enemies. We then describe two conceptual approaches which can be used to examine venom/resistance systems. At the intraspecific level, tests of local adaptation in venom and resistance phenotypes can identify the functional mechanisms governing the outcomes of coevolution. At deeper evolutionary timescales, the combination of phylogenetically informed analyses of protein evolution coupled with studies of protein function promise to elucidate the mode and tempo of evolutionary change on potentially coevolving genes. We highlight case studies that use each approach to extend our knowledge of these systems as well as address larger questions about coevolutionary dynamics. We argue that resistance and venom are phenotypic traits which hold exceptional promise for investigating the mechanisms, dynamics, and outcomes of coevolution at the molecular level. Furthermore, extending the understanding of single gene-for-gene interactions to the whole resistance and venom phenotypes may provide a model system for examining the molecular and evolutionary dynamics of complex multi-gene interactions.",10.1093/icb/icw082,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We used an individual based modelling approach for roach to (i) simulate observed diel habitat shifts between the pelagic and littoral zone of a mesotrophic lake; (ii) analyse the relevance of these habitat shifts for the diet, activity costs and growth of roach; and (iii) quantify the effects of a hypothetical piscivore-mediated (presence of pikeperch) confinement of roach to the littoral zone on roach diet, activity costs and growth.2. The model suggests that in the presence of pikeperch, roach shifts from zooplankton as the primary diet to increased consumption of less nutritious food items such as macrophytes, filamentous algae and detritus.3. The growth of roach between May and October was predicted to be significantly higher in the absence of pikeperch, although the net activity costs were about 60 higher compared with the scenario where pikeperch were present.4. These modelling results provide quantitative information for interpreting diel horizontal migrations of roach as a result from a trade-off between food availability and predation risk in different habitats of a lake.5. Altering the habitat selection mode of planktivorous roach by piscivore stocking has the potential to reduce zooplankton consumption by fish substantially, and could therefore be used as a biomanipulation technique complementing the reduction of zooplanktivorous fish.",10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.01002.x,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Freshwater,Fish,Lake,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"trait = light condition (di/noc), habitat preference, swimming mode",

We recorded adult lifespan in 98 species of geometrid moths. Phylogenetic comparative analyses were applied to study variation in species-specific values of lifespan and to reveal its ecological and life-history correlates. Among-species and between-gender differences in lifespan were found to be notably limited; there was also no evidence of phylogenetic signal in this trait. Larger moth species were found to live longer, with this result supporting a physiological rather than ecological explanation of this relationship.

"HOLMGREN, N",1995,THE IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION OF UNEQUAL COMPETITORS - PREDICTIONS FROM A BEHAVIOR-BASED FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. The spatial distribution of foraging predators differing in foraging traits was investigated theoretically. Three types of individual differences were investigated: dominance that determines the outcomes in fights for food, searching efficiency and prey handling efficiency. The basic assumptions were: (i) predators search for prey; (ii) encountered prey takes time to handle; (iii) the handling process may be interrupted by a searching competitor initiating a conflict about the prey; (iv) conflicts take an expected time to settle; and (v) the winner resumes handling and the loser resumes searching.2. Stable equilibrium distributions were found in all cases, in the sense that no competitor could achieve a higher intake rate from switching patch.3. When it was assumed that each of the predators was different from the others, the ideal free distributions of the dominance model and the handling efficiency model resembled one another. A boundary phenotype existed with more dominant/efficient competitors only occurring in the high prey density patch and less dominant/efficient ones occurring mixed across patches. This was labelled semitruncated distribution. In the search efficiency model, the distribution was truncated, i.e. competitors less efficient than the boundary phenotype only occurred in the high prey density patch whereas the more efficient competitors occurred in the low prey density patch.4. The models were also analysed with the predators classified into two types. As the density of competitors increased, the solution approached a set of neutral equilibria where a few predators of the more efficient type could be exchanged for a larger number of the less efficient type to reach a new equilibrium.5. The density of predators may be negatively correlated with patch productivity and prey density when predators differ in handling efficiency. Prey-searching efficiency of predators was negatively correlated with predator density, patch productivity and prey density. Its consequences for the conservation of species are discussed.",10.2307/5755,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,0,0,1,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = dominance, searching efficiency, prey handling efficiency",
"Holt, RD; Barfield, M",2013,Direct plant-predator interactions as determinants of food chain dynamics,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"Predator prey interactions play out in a physical matrix defined at least to some extent by the quantity and architecture of plant. Ambush predators for instance might more effectively encounter and capture prey in thick vegetation than in thin, open vegetation with good visibility. Yet these vegetation attributes are themselves potentially influenced by the intensity of herbivory, which in turn reflects the magnitude of predation. This intertwining of trophic interactions and basal biomass leads to a largely unexplored feedback in food chain dynamics. In this paper, we examine a number of extensions of standard predator prey and food chain models that incorporate this kind of ""bottom-up"" influence on trophic interactions. Even simple models reveal a range of interesting behaviors. For instance, vegetation-dependent attack rates can generate alternative stable states, in one of which the predator effectively limits herbivores to low numbers, freeing plants of substantial regulation by herbivory, and in the other of which the predator is either absent, or present as an ineffective top trophic level. This can occur both in models in which the top predator is a specialist, completely dependent upon the herbivore, and in models in which the top predator is a generalist, inflicting mortality upon the focal prey species, but itself sustained in numbers by alternative prey. Another possibility is that the feedback between basal biomass and attack rates destabilizes the trophic interactions, leading to sustained oscillations in food chains. Comparable effects can arise if handling times depend upon vegetation biomass. These models illustrate the rich complexity of effects that can arise even in relatively simple community models, once one takes into account the range of potential feedback effects that are potentially present.

"Holzwarth, F; Ruger, N; Wirth, C",2015,Taking a closer look: disentangling effects of functional diversity on ecosystem functions with a trait-based model across hierarchy and time,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,"Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has progressed from the detection of relationships to elucidating their drivers and underlying mechanisms. In this context, replacing taxonomic predictors by trait-based measures of functional composition (FC)-bridging functions of species and of ecosystems-is a widely used approach. The inherent challenge of trait-based approaches is the multi-faceted, dynamic and hierarchical nature of trait influence: (i) traits may act via different facets of their distribution in a community, (ii) their influence may change over time and (iii) traits may influence processes at different levels of the natural hierarchy of organization. Here, we made use of the forest ecosystem model 'LPJ-GUESS' parametrized with empirical trait data, which creates output of individual performance, community assembly, stand-level states and processes. To address the three challenges, we resolved the dynamics of the top-level ecosystem function 'annual biomass change' hierarchically into its various component processes (growth, leaf and root turnover, recruitment and mortality) and states (stand structures, water stress) and traced the influence of different facets of FC along this hierarchy in a path analysis. We found an independent influence of functional richness, dissimilarity and identity on ecosystem states and processes and hence biomass change. Biodiversity effects were only positive during early succession and later turned negative. Unexpectedly, resource acquisition (growth, recruitment) and conservation (mortality, turnover) played an equally important role throughout the succession. These results add to a mechanistic understanding of biodiversity effects and place a caveat on simplistic approaches omitting hierarchical levels when analysing BEF relationships. They support the view that BEF relationships experience dramatic shifts over successional time that should be acknowledged in mechanistic theories.",10.1098/rsos.140541,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,1,1,1,1,0,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = maximum projected tree crown area (m2)	allometry: crownarea [qm] = k1*BHD [m] ^k_rp	allometry: height [m] = k2*BHD [m] ^k3	allometry: height [m] = k2*BHD [m] ^k3	allometry: crownarea [qm] = k1*BHD [m] ^k_rp	wood density [kgC/m3]	leaf C:N mass ratio	root C:N ratio	sapwood C:N ratio	 (kest_repr*cmass_repr should be approximately equal 1 at the highest plausible value of cmass_repr for the PFT)	range 0-1 (usually << 1) (set to 0 if background establishment disabled)	range 0-1 (usually ~1)	litter moisture flammability threshold (fraction of AWC)	respiration coefficient	low temp-limit for photosynth	 lower range of temp-optimum for photosynth	 upper range of temp-optimum for photosynth	high temp-limit for photosynth	minimum forest floor PAR level for growth (grasses) or establishment (trees) (J/m2/day)	threshold growth efficiency for imposition of growth suppression mortality (kgC/m2 leaf/yr)	initial maximum establishment rate for this PFT (saplings/m2/yr)	parameter capturing non-linearity in recruitment rate relative to understorey growing conditions	annual sapwood turnover as a proportion of sapwood C biomass	leaf turnover per time period as a proportion of leaf C biomass	root turnover per time period as a proportion of root C biomass	plant root distribution (fraction of fine roots in upper layer 0-50cm)	ratio of leaf area to sapwood cross-sectional area (PFT-specific constant) (Pipe Model McDowell et al. 2002)	specific leaf area (PFT-specific constant) (m2/kgC)	canopy conductance component not associated with photosynthesis (mm/s)	leaf longevity (years),

In this study, located in the Central French Alps, we used high spatial and spectral resolution RS images to assess multiple ES based on underpinning ecosystem properties (EP) of subalpine grasslands. We estimated five EP (green biomass, litter mass, crude protein content, species diversity and soil carbon content) from RS data using empirical RS methods and maps of ES were calculated as simple linear combinations of EP. Additionally, the RS-based results were compared with results of a plant trait-based statistical modelling approach that predicted EP and ES from land use, abiotic and plant trait data (modelling approach). The comparison between the RS and the modelling approaches showed that RS-based results provided better insight into the fine-grained spatial distribution of EP and thereby ES, whereas the modelling approach reflected the land use signal that underpinned trait-based models of EP. The spatial agreement between the two approaches at a 20-m resolution varied between 16 and 22% for individual EP, but for the total ecosystem service supply it was only 7%. Furthermore, the modelling approach identified the alpine grazed meadows land use class as areas with high values of multiple ES (hot spots) and mown-grazed permanent meadows as areas with low values and only few ES (cold spots). Whereas the RS-based hot spots were a small subset of those predicted by the modelling approach, cold spots were rather scattered, small patches with limited overlap with the modelling results. Despite limitations associated with timing of assessment campaigns and field data requirements, RS offers valuable data for spatially continuous mapping of EP and can thus supply RS-based proxies of ES. Although the RS approach was applied to a limited area and for one type of ecosystem, we believe that the broader availability of high fidelity airborne and satellite RS data will promote RS-based assessment of ES to larger areas and other ecosystems.",10.1890/ES13-00393.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Evidences are that plant scientists agree on a set of key plant traits, which are relatively easy to measure and have a stable and strong predictive response to ecosystem functions. However, the field measurements of plant trait data are still limited to small area, to a certain moment in time and to certain number of species only. Therefore, remote sensing (RS) offers potential to complement or even replace field measurements of some plant traits. It offers instantaneous spatially contiguous information, covers larger areas and in case of satellite observations profits from their revisit capacity.In this review, we first introduce RS concepts of light-vegetation interactions, RS instruments for vegetation studies, RS methods, and scaling between field and RS observations. Further we discuss in detail current achievements and challenges of optical RS for mapping of key plant traits. We concentrate our discussion on three categorical plant traits (plant growth and life forms, flammability properties and photosynthetic pathways and activity) and on five continuous plant traits (plant height, leaf phenology, leaf mass per area, nitrogen and phosphorous concentration or content). We review existing literature to determine the retrieval accuracy of the continuous plant traits. The relative estimation error using RS ranged between 10% and 45% of measured mean value, i.e. around 10% for plant height of tall canopies, 20% for plant height of short canopies, 15% for plant nitrogen, 25% for plant phosphorus content/concentration, and 45% for leaf mass per area estimates.The potential of RS to map plant traits is particularly high when traits are related to leaf biochemistry, photosynthetic processes and canopy structure. There are also other plant traits, i.e. leaf chlorophyll content, water content and leaf area index, which can be retrieved from optical RS well and can be of importance for plant scientists.We underline the need that future assessments of ecosystem functioning using RS should require comprehensive and integrated measurements of various plant traits together with leaf and canopy spectral properties. By doing so, the interplay between plant structural, physiological, biochemical, phenological and spectral properties can be better understood. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent work suggests that bacterial biodiversity might exhibit patterns similar to those of plants and animals. However, relative to our knowledge about the diversity of macro-organisms, we know little about patterns of relatedness in free-living bacterial communities, and relatively few studies have quantitatively examined community structure in a phylogenetic framework. Here we apply phylogenetic tools to bacterial diversity data to determine whether bacterial communities are phylogenetically structured. We find that bacterial communities tend to contain lower taxonomic diversity and are more likely to be phylogenetically clustered than expected by, chance. Such phylogenetic clustering may indicate the importance of habitat filtering (where a group of closely related species shares a trait, or suite of traits, that allow them to persist in a given habitat) in the assembly of bacterial communities.

The sediment below aquaculture farms receives inputs of antimicrobials, metal-containing products, and organic matter from uneaten food and fecal material. These inputs impact the surrounding marine microbial communities in complex ways; however, functional diversity shifts related to taxonomic composition remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of pollution from marine fish farms on sediment bacterial communities. We compared the bacterial communities and functional bacterial diversity in surface sediments at salmon aquaculture and reference sites in Chilo,, southern Chile, using Roche 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the predictive metagenomics approach (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States, PICRUSt). Bacterial diversity, measured as the inverse Simpson index, was significantly lower at aquaculture than at reference sites, while species richness, based on Chao's estimator, was not significantly different. Nevertheless, community composition differed significantly between reference and aquaculture sites. We found that Gammaproteobacteria and several taxa involved in remediating metal contamination and known to have antimicrobial resistances were enriched at aquaculture sites. However, PICRUSt predicted functions indicated a degree of functional redundancy between sites, whereas taxonomic-functional relationships indicated differences in the functional traits of specific taxa at aquaculture sites.

One of the hypothesised mechanisms for such widespread variation is ecological opportunity, i.e. resource availability determined by intrinsic constraints and extrinsic conditions. In this study, we combined tracking data and stable isotope analysis to examine how breeding constraints and prey conditions influenced intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. Isotopic variation was also examined as a function of breeding success, individual traits and individual specialisation. Variation in isotope ratios was greatest across multiple tissue types when birds were able to undertake mid-range foraging trips (i.e. during incubation and pre-moult). This variation was highly consistent between years that spanned a 3-fold difference in local prey Euphausia superba density, and was also highly consistent at the individual level between 2 years that had similar prey densities. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on the same population, it appeared that a decrease in local prey availability can also increase intrapopulation variation in resource use during periods with more restricted foraging ranges (i.e. during brood-guard and creche).

Understanding the demographic response of free-living animal populations to different drivers is the first step towards reliable prediction of population trends.2. Penguins have exhibited dramatic declines in population size, and many studies have linked this to bottom-up processes altering the abundance of prey species. The effects of individual traits have been considered to a lesser extent, and top-down regulation through predation has been largely overlooked due to the difficulties in empirically measuring this at sea where it usually occurs.3. For 10 years (2003-2012), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were marked with subcutaneous electronic transponder tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. We used multistate mark-recapture modelling to identify the different drivers influencing survival rates and a sensitivity analysis to assess their relative importance across different life stages.4. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year (mean = 0.33), increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards (mean = 0.89). We show that survival of macaroni penguins is driven by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates was age specific. During the fledging year, survival rates were most sensitive to top-down predation pressure, followed by individual fledging mass, and finally bottom-up environmental effects. In contrast, birds older than 1 year showed a similar response to bottom-up environmental effects and top-down predation pressure.5. We infer from our results that macaroni penguins will most likely be negatively impacted by an increase in the local population size of giant petrels. Furthermore, this population is, at least in the short term, likely to be positively influenced by local warming. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life stages when examining the survival rates of seabirds.",10.1111/1365-2656.12229,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

This correlation has been the subject of controversy, and has been demonstrated to exist in only a few cases. The relative extent of orange coloration exhibited by male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) contributes to the mating preference of female guppies in certain populations. If the predicted genetic correlation between preference and male traits exists, then artificial selection for increased and decreased amounts of orange in colour patterns of male guppies should result in corresponding shifts in female mating preference. Four separate selection experiments produced an immediate divergence in male colour patterns between high and low selection lines. Analysis of mate choice of females from the selection experiments provides some evidence for correlated divergence in preference as predicted by theory. Females from lines in which males were selected for increased orange tended to show stronger preference for orange than did females from lines selected for decreased orange. This kind of correlated change in preference could contribute to the correlated pattern of variation in colour pattern and female preference across guppy populations.",10.1098/rspb.1994.0059,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The model incorporates seal diet preference, population size and commercial fishery catch, with survey data to quantify ecological interactions between seals and fisheries. Total annual consumption by seals was an order of magnitude less than the catch of the modelled trawl fishery. Increasing fishing pressure reduced fish spawning stock biomass (SSB) much more than a proportionally equivalent increase in seal predation. For most fish species, quadrupling seal predation showed little effect on the predicted fishery catch. These results arise from relatively low seal abundance and partial niche partitioning. The fishery harvested a wider range of fish lengths and species than seals consumed. The fish community was dominated by small fish lengths and seals predated on these more than suggested by their calculated diet preference. Seal predation disproportionately affected several fish species not targeted by the fishery, but seal predation did not significantly affect the SSB of any of the species that constitute 90% of the total landings of the fishery.Synthesis and applications. Predation of fish by grey and harbour seals is unlikely to harm commercial trawl fisheries in south-west Irish waters. This conclusion differs from those of some model-based studies of other North Atlantic systems, demonstrating the need for ecosystem-specific evidence in considering such conflicts.

Each predator induced a unique suite of behavioral and morphological responses. Snails increased near-surface habitat use with crayfish but not with water bugs. Further, crayfish induced narrow and high shells whereas water bugs induced wide shells and wide apertures. In terms of life history, both predators induced delayed reproduction and greater mass at reproduction. However, crayfish induced a greater delay in reproduction that resulted in reduced fecundity whereas water bugs did not induce differences in fecundity. Resource levels impacted the morphology of H. trivolvis; snails reared with greater resource levels produced higher shells, narrower shells, and wider apertures. Resource levels also impacted snail life history; lower resources caused longer times to reproduction and reduced fecundity. Based on an analysis of phenotypic correlations, the morphological responses to each predator most likely represent phenotypic trade-offs. Snails could either produce invasion-resistant shells for defense against water bugs or crush-resistant shells for defense against crayfish, but not both. Our use of a comprehensive approach to examine the responses of H. trivolvis has provided important information regarding the complexity of phenotypic responses to different environments, the patterns of phenotypic integration across environments, and the potential costs and benefits associated with plastic traits.",10.1007/s00442-005-0082-8,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,"thought this was relevant, but the traits they look at they look at how the predator influences the traits, so not relevant",

This is because the morphology of individuals reflects their evolutionary history and ecology, and imparts a distinct 'look' to communities making it possible to immediately discern between deserts and forests, or coral reefs and abyssal plains. Once quantified, morphology can provide a common metric for characterizing communities across space and time and, if measured rapidly, serve as a powerful tool for quantifying biotic dynamics. Here, we present and test a new high-throughput approach for analysing community shape in the fossil record using semi-three-dimensional (3D) morphometrics from vertically stacked images (light microscopic or photogrammetric). We assess the potential informativeness of community morphology in a first analysis of the relationship between 3D morphology, ecology and phylogeny in 16 extant species of planktonic foraminifera an abundant group in the marine fossil record and in a preliminary comparison of four assemblages from the North Atlantic. In the species examined, phylogenetic relatedness was most closely correlated with ecology, with all three ecological traits examined (depth habitat, symbiont ecology and biogeography) showing significant phylogenetic signal. By contrast, morphological trees (based on 3D shape similarity) were relatively distantly related to both ecology and phylogeny. Although improvements are needed to realize the full utility of community morphometrics, our approach already provides robust volumetric measurements of assemblage size, a key ecological characteristic.",10.1098/rstb.2015.0227,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Huang, X",2008,On the energy trait control phenomena in ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Prevailing ecological control theory is based on predation phenomena, it implies that a symbiotic ecosystem results from the predator imposing on prey a low, stable equilibrium. Mathematically, such dynamic model, like prevailing control equations, stresses directly regulating the state of prey, the controlled population, while the input variable of the control is state variable of the predator population. However, predation relation is not unique theorem to explain every kind of interaction between populations, the interactions without energy or biomass exchange are scarcely depicted by the dynamic models which depict the interaction based on principle of predation. How to model the interrelation deals with how to comprehend the interaction mechanism. Many researchers have recognized that some interactions work in indirect ways, regulating state of a population via imposing on its ecological/physiological trait is also one mode of interaction between the populations. These phenomena broadly exist in ecosystems. If coefficients of state equation of the regulated population are defined in terms of their ecological trait, regulating the coefficients to vary the population state may implement a kind of particular control processes, namely, trait control. Expressed by differential dynamic equations, as well known, an ecosystem may exhibit different formal solutions by regulating coefficients of the equations, and each solution corresponds to an ecological pattern. This is theoretic basis of ecological trait control. Introduced trait control function by means of coefficient regulation, the dynamic model can depict many indirect effects caused by biotic or abiotic ecological factors, and explain more complex phenomena in ecosystems. For instance, the environmental factors can be considered as variables imposing on the trait of the ecosystem. This paper applies Life Energy System dynamic model (LESM) to illustrate the principle and analysis approach of energy trait control; possible energy trait control modes are proposed according to different interaction between populations in an ecosystem. It was found that the trait control could realize distinct control effect from that depicted by traditional biological control models. With the trait control function, the dynamic model is able to interpret more complex ecological structures and potential evolutionary mechanism. Such exploration may provide further research on complexity of ecosystem with theoretical basis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Hufbauer, RA",2002,Aphid population dynamics: does resistance to parasitism influence population size?,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,"1. Insect population size is regulated by both intrinsic traits of organisms and extrinsic factors. The impacts of natural enemies are typically considered to be extrinsic factors. however insects have traits that affect their vulnerability to attack by natural enemies, and thus intrinsic and extrinsic factors can interact in their effects on population size.2. Pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in New York and Maryland that are specialised on alfalfa are approximately two times more physiologically resistant to parasitism by Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) than pea aphids specialised on clover. To assess the potential influence of this genetically based difference in resistance to parasitism on pea aphid population dynamics, pea aphids, A. ervi, and other natural enemies of aphids in clover and alfalfa fields were sampled.3. Rates of successful parasitism by A. ervi were higher and pea aphid Population sizes were lower in clover, where the aphids are less resistant to parasitism. In contrast. mortality due to a fungal pathogen of pea aphids was higher in alfalfa. Generalist aphid predators did not differ significantly in density between the crops.4. To explore whether intrinsic resistance to parasitism influences field dynamics, the relationship between resistance and successful field parasitism in 12 populations was analysed. The average level of resistance of a population strongly predicts rates of successful parasitism in the field.

This broadened perspective is largely based on comparative approaches that employ ""natural experiments"" to identify factors shaping community structure. Because coastal rivers are separated from one another by insurmountable barriers (oceans or land), freshwater fishes are particularly well suited for comparative analyses of factors that influence fish community organization. In this chapter, we review how this comparative approach shed light on large-scale biodiversity gradients, community saturation, community convergence, density compensation, and the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in community dynamics. The main factors (e.g., river mouth discharge and history) empirically related to species richness of a river are well identified, and metacommunity ecology provides a fruitful conceptual framework for understanding how regional (river) species richness translates into local species richness. Much work remains to identify factors explaining differences among whole river basin assemblages with regard to ecological traits (e.g., trophic status and life history) composition and to assess whether trait-related environmental and biotic local filters act similarly over large spatial scales. One important conclusion that can be drawn from the studies reviewed here is that history cannot be neglected whatever the scale of investigation (global, river, or site). A second conclusion is that historical effects are not strong enough to blur the occurrence of qualitatively repeatable patterns of community structure over large spatial scale, which is encouraging because it suggests development of general predictive models of community structure is an attainable goal.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,traits only suggested as things to look at,

Coevolution has since Darwin been considered a potential path leading to adaptive diversification that could explain the emergence of ecological networks of biotic interactions that harbour multiple interacting species (eg, pollination networks and food webs). Here, we present adaptive dynamics, a powerful tool of evolutionary invasion analysis that explores how quantitative traits undergo incremental evolution, to exploring the emergence of multi-species networks through coevolution. Specifically, we exemplify the feasibility of using adaptive dynamics to investigate trait evolution in 4 ecological networks, driven, respectively, by resource competition, trophic interactions, as well as bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We use a set of ordinary differential equations to describe, at different paces, the population dynamics and trait dynamics of involved species assemblages. Through computing ecological equilibrium, invasion fitness, selection gradient and evolutionary singularity, and testing for evolutionary stability and the coexistence criterion of mutual invasibility, we illustrate the typical evolutionary dynamics and the criteria of evolutionary stability and branching in these ecological networks. Results highlight the importance of the form of trait-mediated interaction kernel (ie, interaction strength as a function of trait difference) to adaptive diversification in these coevolutionary systems. We conclude by advocating that biotic interactions between two species can indeed lead to diffuse and even escape-and-radiate coevolution, making the emerged ecological networks an ideal model for studying complex adaptive systems.",10.1002/mma.4612,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

"Hulme, PE; Bernard-Verdier, M",2018,Comparing traits of native and alien plants: Can we do better?,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"A frequent question in invasion ecology is whether the traits of alien plant species differ from natives. This question is increasingly addressed at the plant community scale to assess the role trait differences play in community assembly. Nevertheless, there remains considerable debate as to the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Recommendations are made to address seven conceptual and methodological limitations in current approaches used to assess trait differences between native and alien plants: account for spatial scale dependence, make an informed choice of traits, evaluate multiple trait dimensions, incorporate intraspecific trait variation, use appropriate null models, examine environmental gradients, and assess temporal variation in trait spectra. Tackling these limitations will dramatically improve the value of native vs. alien trait comparisons. Traits should be selected based on expectations of abiotic and/or biotic constraints. Phylogenetic distances can provide valuable insights but are no substitute for the measurement of individual traits when contrasting alien and native species. An ideal set of traits would include one or more leaf, stem, seed and root traits as well as flowering phenology and plant height at maturity. Comparisons of intraspecific trait variation among native and alien species within the same plant community are rare but could improve predictions of interspecific competition and the response of communities to plant invasions. The full plant community should be examined rather than selected species subsets and comparisons between native and alien species traits are better undertaken at a neighbourhood scale. The frequency distribution of alien and native species traits may change over time through competitive exclusion as well as contemporary evolution. Repeated surveys of species abundances and traits are required to understand the consequences of trait differences between aliens and natives for plant community assembly. Analyses of the role of species traits in plant invasions need to quantify differences in a priori identified traits within communities along suitable environmental gradients and test hypothetical trait patterns against appropriate null expectations. The infrequent application of such approaches may explain the limited generalisations regarding the role of trait differences between native and alien species in the invasion of plant communities.

"Hulshof, CM; Swenson, NG",2010,Variation in leaf functional trait values within and across individuals and species: an example from a Costa Rican dry forest,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"P>1. Patterns of species co-existence and species diversity in plant communities remain an important research area despite over a century of intensive scrutiny. To provide mechanistic insight into the rules governing plant species co-existence and diversity, plant community ecologists are increasingly quantifying functional trait values for the species found in a wide range of communities. 2. Despite the promise of a quantitative functional trait approach to plant community ecology, we suggest that, along with examining trait variation across species, an assessment of trait variation within species should also be a key component of a trait-based approach to community ecology. Variability within and between individuals and populations is likely widespread due to plastic responses to highly localized abiotic and biotic interactions. 3. In this study, we quantify leaf trait variation within and across ten co-existing tree species in a dry tropical forest in Costa Rica to ask: (i) whether the majority of trait variation is located between species, within species, within individuals or within the leaves themselves; (ii) whether trait values collected using standardized methods correlate with those collected using unstandardized methods; and (iii) to what extent can we differentiate plant species on the basis of their traits? 4. We find that the majority of variation in traits was often explained by between species differences; however, between leaflet trait variation was very high for compound-leaved species. We also show that many species are difficult to reliably differentiate on the basis of functional traits even when sampling many individuals. 5. We suggest an ideal sample size of at least 10, and ideally 20, individuals be used when calculating mean trait values for individual species for entire communities, though even at large sample sizes, it remains unclear if community level trait values will allow comparisons on a larger geographic scale or if species traits are generally similar across scales. It will thus be critical to account for intraspecific variation by comparing species mean trait values across space in multiple microclimatic environments within local communities and along environmental gradients. Further, quantifying trait variability due to plasticity and inheritance will provide a better understanding of the underlying patterns and drivers of trait variation as well as the application of functional traits in outlining mechanisms of species co-existence.",10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01614.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Seasonal Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = leaf area, dry mass, SLA, leaf water contnet.

Most shrimp communities were more closely related and/or more similar in size than randomized communities, consistent with habitat filtering facilitated by phylogenetically conserved body size. Those sponges with greater space heterogeneity hosted shrimp communities with greater size diversity, corroborating the importance of size in niche use. However, communities containing eusocial shrimp which cooperatively defend territories were less phylogenetically related and less similar in size, suggesting that eusociality enhances competitive ability and drives competitive exclusion.

"Hunt, RM",2011,"EVOLUTION OF LARGE CARNIVORES DURING THE MID-CENOZOIC OF NORTH AMERICA: THE TEMNOCYONINE RADIATION (MAMMALIA, AMPHICYONIDAE)",BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,"This study describes and summarizes the Temnocyoninae (Mammalia, Carnivora), a subfamily of amphicyonid carnivores of considerable diversity and singular ecomorphology within Cenozoic faunas of North America. In temnocyonines, we see the first carnivorans to occupy an ecological niche as large cursorial predators. The subfamily is confined to the Arikareean NALMA, ranging in age from the latest early Oligocene to the early Miocene. Distributed from the Pacific Northwest to the Great Plains and Florida, there are four genera (Temnocyon, Mammacyon, Delotrochanter n. gen., Rudiocyon n. gen.) and 12 species, of which eight are newly described (Temnocyon subferox, T. fingeruti, T macrogenys; Rudiocyon amplidens; Mammacyon ferocior; Delotrochanter petersoni, D. oryktes, D. major). Among the specimens examined are eight skulls, three with intact basicranial morphology that establish the presence of a plesiomorphic arctoid auditory region in the subfamily. Temnocyonine dentitions and postcranial skeletons reveal a blend of morphological characteristics not previously nor subsequently seen among the Carnivora. From a stem species, Temnocyon altigenis, there evolve both large hypercarnivorous (Temnocyon) and durophagous forms (Mammacyon, Delotrochanter); these genera share a derived dentition that defines the Temnocyoninae. Delotrochanter oryktes n. sp., an early Miocene species, was found in a den, suggesting a possible burrowing capability and sheltering of offspring. The John Day basin of Oregon and the central Great Plains (western Nebraska, southeast Wyoming) are the source of most temnocyonine fossils; a few have been found in southern California and Florida, indicative of a continent-wide distribution. Temnocyonines have often been confused with canids, however their basicranial anatomy places them securely within the Amphicyonidae. First discovered in the 1870s, only similar to 30 individuals comprise the entire record of the subfamily. Many were found in proximity to radioisotopically calibrated tuffs and ignimbrites and/or were closely associated with mammals of established biochronologic age. Thus, most species can be placed in a temporal context. With rare exception, the fossils represent isolated occurrences, hence estimates of variation within a population are lacking. Cursorial postcranial features characterize several lineages (Mammacyon, Delotrochanter) and probably were present in other temnocyonines known only from dental remains. Late Oligocene Mammacyon ferocior and early Miocene Delotrochanter oryktes evolved uniquely configured crushing cheek teeth and cursorial limbs, combining distinctive dental and skeletal traits in a manner not seen in any living carnivore. These species are interpreted as large durophagous predators with craniodental characteristics that parallel living hyaenids (Crocuta crocuta) and postcranial adaptations approaching those of cursorial canids such as the wolf (Canis lupus). Expansion of semiarid grasslands and savanna during the late Oligocene and early Miocene in the central Great Plains seems to have favored the evolution of these wide-ranging durophagous amphicyonid carnivores. Analysis of the jaws of temnocyonines employing Therrien's method of beam analysis demonstrates pronounced bending strength focused beneath the crushing dental battery in the molar region. Similarly, the canines and mandibular symphysis manifest an ability to resist strong parasagittal, transverse, and torsional forces occurring during prey capture and feeding. Temnocyonines share a pronounced similarity in dentition with European haplocyonine beardogs, which doubtless are their sister group among the Amphicyonidae. Some haplocyonines also show cursorial tendencies. Examination of European material, however, reveals subtle dental distinctions indicating that the evolution of the two subfamilies proceeded separately yet in parallel in Europe and North America.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Multilayer networks in community ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact. Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join different networkstermed layerstogether and represent ecological processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer edges representing movement for networks separated in space). Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However, multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche partitioning, the connection between traits and species' interactions, and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution.Synthesis. Multilayer networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However, describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently, have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that underpin diversity in ecological communities.",10.1111/1365-2435.13237,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Huxel, GR",2007,Antagonistic and synergistic interactions among predators,BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY,"The structure and dynamics of food webs are largely dependent upon interactions among consumers and their resources. However, interspecific interactions such as intraguild predation and interference competition can also play a significant role in the stability of communities. The role of antagonistic/synergistic interactions among predators has been largely ignored in food web theory. These mechanisms influence predation rates, which is one of the key factors regulating food web structure and dynamics, thus ignoring them can potentially limit understanding of food webs. Using nonlinear models, it is shown that critical aspects of multiple predator food web dynamics are antagonistic/synergistic interactions among predators. The influence of antagonistic/synergistic interactions on coexistence of predators depended largely upon the parameter set used and the degree of feeding niche differentiation. In all cases when there was no effect of antagonism or synergism (a(ij) =1.00), the predators coexisted. Using the stable parameter set, coexistence occurred across the range of antagonism/synergism used. However, using the chaotic parameter strong antagonism resulted in the extinction of one or both species, while strong synergism tended to coexistence. Whereas using the limit cycle parameter set, coexistence was strongly dependent on the degree of feeding niche overlap. Additionally increasing the degree of feeding specialization of the predators on the two prey species increased the amount of parameter space in which coexistence of the two predators occurred. Bifurcation analyses supported the general pattern of increased stability when the predator interaction was synergistic and decreased stability when it was antagonistic. Thus, synergistic interactions should be more common than antagonistic interactions in ecological systems.",10.1007/s11538-007-9214-0,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Insect herbivores choose their food according to as protein to carbohydrate ratio, but the reasons why different species have contrasting intake targets remain unclear. According to the growth rate hypothesis, P-rich insects have higher growth rates, It is therefore expected that P-rich insects will prefer plants that are high in protein (hence in nitrogen, N) and phosphorus (P). 2. To test this hypothesis, the ecological stoichiometry and the interaction network frameworks were combined. The food preferences of 24 plant species by 23 grasshopper species were determined, and the N and P contents of both trophic levels were measured. The weighted mean P and N contents of the consumed plants, which represent the grasshoppers' feeding niche, were highly correlated, indicating that the grasshoppers' diets are spread along a single functional niche axis. The links between the stoichiometry of the plants and their consumers were then tested with the fourth corner analysis, a. multivariate technique combining the plant traits, the insect traits and the interaction network. 3. In line with the earlier hypothesis, P-rich grasshoppers consumed plants high in N and P, probably because their growth rate is higher.

Prevention of blooms requires that external and internal sources of nutrients are managed to levels where development of cyanobacterial blooms is restricted. Control of blooms, in which their presence is reduced to a level where they no longer pose a risk through additional measures such as biomanipulation or artificial mixing, demands that three elements come together: (1) understanding of the key ecological traits of the dominant cyanobacteria taxa, (2) system analysis of the lake, in particular its morphometry, water and nutrient balance, (3) adequate design and execution of the management methods of choice. All three elements are important for choosing effective management interventions and predicting their outcome. Mitigation of blooms reduces the risks and harmful effects of blooms if they cannot be prevented or sufficiently controlled, methods such as harvesting of surface scums or application of cyanocides may be used in those cases where water quality improvement is urgent. Ultimately, managing cyanobacterial blooms is most effective in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan.

Theoretical models predict that genetic or phenotypic variance within species can alter interspecific interactions, and experiments have shown that genotypic diversity in clonal species can impact a wide range of ecological processes. To extend these studies to quantitative trait variation within populations, we experimentally manipulated the variance in body size of threespine stickleback in enclosures in a natural lake environment. We found that body size of stickleback in the lake is correlated with prey size and (to a lesser extent) composition, and that stickleback can exert top-down control on their benthic prey in enclosures. However, a six-fold contrast in body size variance had no effect on the degree of diet variation among individuals, or on the abundance or composition of benthic or pelagic prey. Interestingly, post-hoc analyses revealed suggestive correlations between the degree of diet variation and the strength of top-down control by stickleback. Our negative results indicate that, unless the correlation between morphology and diet is very strong, ecological variation among individuals may be largely decoupled from morphological variance. Consequently we should be cautious in our interpretation both of theoretical models that assume perfect correlations between morphology and diet, and of empirical studies that use morphological variation as a proxy for resource use diversity.",10.1371/journal.pone.0020782,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,Lake,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,1,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = body size,

Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01460.x,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = body size.

Using knowledge of leaf functional traits, such as those forming the leaf economics spectrum (LES), to understand plant responses to environmental change is well-established and now being more widely applied to agroecosystems. Yet, little is known about how farm managers invoke leaf functional traits to inform management decisions.2. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate whether farmers use knowledge of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in LES traits (or trait proxies) of target crops as response indicators of management conditions; (2) determine whether LES trait values are ranked consistently among multiple farmers along a ""Farmer Leaf Economics Spectrum"" (FES); (3) evaluate how a FES corresponds to the LES; and (4) identify the farmer and farm attributes that best predict the agreement between the FES and the LES.3. We collaborated with coffee (Coffea arabica) farmers in the Turrialba Valley, Costa Rica. We used a visual elicitation tool of fresh leaves along an intraspecific spectrum of leaf size, leaf thickness and leaf colour (as a proxy for leaf nutrients); respondents were asked to rank leaves in response to shade and nutrient scenarios as well as yield potential. On-farm biophysical data, management practices and socio-economic attributes were also collected.4. The majority of farmers demonstrated a developed system of utilizing coffee leaf and whole-plant ITV as indicators of management practices. Farmers managing smaller farms tended to more commonly acknowledge ITV in LES chemical-morphological traits, as compared to those managing large farms. The agreement between a respondent-identified ranking of leaf thickness ITV as a function of light environment and an empirically defined thickness-to-light ranking was partially explained by farmers' physical engagement with plants.5. Synthesis and applications. In scientific literature, analyses of crop intraspecific trait variation have provided important insights into the mechanistic bases of multiple key agroecological processes. We demonstrate that farmers use crop leaf trait variation as an indicator to both evaluate management prescriptions and to initiate management actions including shade-tree species selection and abundance, crop-and shade-tree pruning regimes and fertilization treatments. These findings signify that functional traits represent a key nexus between scientific and local knowledge.",10.1111/1365-2664.13027,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here, we used multivariate statistics and a null model approach to test the hypothesis that environmental conditions and obstructed dispersal opportunities, dictate a deterministic community assembly for phytoplankton and bacterioplankton across contrasting hydrographic conditions in a subtropical mid-sized river (Jiulong River, southeast China). Variation partitioning analysis showed that the explanatory power of local environmental variables was larger than that of the spatial variables for both plankton communities during the dry season. During the wet season, phytoplankton community variation was mainly explained by local environmental variables, whereas the variance in bacterioplankton was explained by both environmental and spatial predictors. The null model based on Raup-Crick coefficients for both planktonic groups suggested little evidences of the stochastic processes involving dispersal and random distribution. Our results showed that hydrological change and landscape structure act together to cause divergence in communities along the river channel, thereby dictating a deterministic assembly and that selection exceeds dispersal limitation during the dry season. Therefore, to protect the ecological integrity of human-impacted rivers, watershed managers should not only consider local environmental conditions but also dispersal routes to account for the effect of regional species pool on local communities.

By extending the previous model for the coevolution of quantitative traits to introduce nonlinear costs for exaggerated traits, the generation overlap, and density-dependent regulation in the host, we studied the evolutionarily stable (ES) pericarp thickness in the Japanese camellia (Camellia japonica) and the ES rostrum length in the camellia-weevil (Curculio camelliae). The joint monomorphic ES system has a robust outcome with nonlinear costs, and we analyzed how the traits of both species at evolutionary equilibrium depend on demographic parameters. If camellia demographic parameters vary latitudinally, data collected over the geographical scale of rostrum length and pericarp thickness should lie on an approximately linear curve with the slope less than that of the equiprobability line A/B of boring success, where A and B are coefficients for the logistic regression of boring success to pericarp thickness and rostrum length, respectively. This is a robust prediction as long as the cost of rostrum length is nonlinear (accelerating). As a result, boring success should be lower in populations with longer rostrum length, as reported in the weevil-camellia system (Toju, H., and Sota, T., 2006a. Imbalance of predator and prey armament: Geographic clines in phenotypic interface and natural selection. American Naturalist 167, 105-117).

"Ito, HC; Dieckmann, U",2012,Evolutionary-branching lines and areas in bivariate trait spaces,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,"Aims: Evolutionary branching is a process of evolutionary diversification induced by frequency-dependent ecological interaction. Here we show how to predict the occurrence of evolutionary branching in bivariate traits when populations are evolving directionally. Methods: Following adaptive dynamics theory, we assume low mutation rates and small mutational step sizes. On this basis, we generalize conditions for evolutionary-branching points to conditions for evolutionary-branching lines and areas, which delineate regions of trait space in which evolutionary branching can be expected despite populations still evolving directionally along these lines and within these areas. To assess the quality of predictions provided by our new conditions for evolutionary-branching lines and areas, we analyse three eco-evolutionary models with bivariate trait spaces, comparing the predicted evolutionary-branching lines and areas with actual occurrences of evolutionary branching in numerically calculated evolutionary dynamics. In the three examples, a phenotype's fitness is affected by frequency-dependent resource competition and/or predator prey interaction. Conclusions: In the limit of infinitesimal mutational step sizes, evolutionary branching in bivariate trait spaces can occur only at evolutionary-branching points, i.e. where the evolving population experiences disruptive selection in the absence of any directional selection. In contrast, when mutational step sizes are finite, evolutionary branching can occur also along evolutionary-branching lines, i.e. where disruptive selection orthogonal to these lines is sufficiently strong relative to directional selection along them. Moreover, such evolutionary-branching lines are embedded in evolutionary-branching areas, which delineate all bivariate trait combinations for which evolutionary branching can occur when mutation rates are low, while mutational step sizes are finite. Our analyses show that evolutionary-branching lines and areas are good indicators of evolutionary branching in directionally evolving populations. We also demonstrate that not all evolutionary-branching lines and areas contain evolutionary-branching points, so evolutionary branching is possible even in trait spaces that contain no evolutionary-branching point at all.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"IVERSON, JB",1991,"LIFE-HISTORY AND DEMOGRAPHY OF THE YELLOW MUD TURTLE, KINOSTERNON-FLAVESCENS",HERPETOLOGICA,"Life history traits of the yellow mud turtle, Kinosternon flavescens, were studied from 1981 to 1988 in the Nebraska Sandhills. Females mature at about 90 mm carapace length (CL) after an average of 11 yr of age. Hatchling females are larger than males, but males are larger than females in all age classes older than 3 yr. The relationship of age to CL was determined by applying the von Bertalanffy growth model to long-term recapture data. Egg width and mass were correlated with body size, but egg length was not. Clutch size (xBAR = 6.5; range = 4-9) was highly correlated with body size. When the effect of body size was removed, egg size was inversely correlated with clutch size. A maximum of one clutch was produced each year, but only about 75% of females nested in any given year. Annual frequency of nesting was not related to female size but appeared to be positively correlated with late spring temperatures in the current and past year. Relative clutch mass (RCM) averaged 10.9% and was correlated with female size and clutch size. Expenditure per progeny (RCM/clutch size) was inversely correlated with female size and only weakly related to egg size. Pelvis size did not constrain egg size, and increases in female reproductive output with body size were accomplished both by increases in egg size (mainly in width) and egg number. A complex trade-off between egg size and clutch size is apparently being selected for. Although the species exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination, cohort sex ratios were not significantly different from parity, nor were they correlated with annual mid-summer air or soil temperatures. Mortality during the first year of life was extremely high (81%), due primarily to egg predation. Egg infertility, overwintering, and migration to the water the following spring also account for small losses. Annual survivorship by juveniles was relatively high (30-70%) and exceeded 90% by the sixth year and 95% by the eighth year. The species exhibits a Type III survivorship curve. Life table analysis showed that the population was growing slightly (R(o) = 1.06) and that mean cohort generation time was 28.2 yr. The major sources of variation were (1) juvenile survivorship, (2) annual frequency of nesting, (3) age at maturity, and (4) hatchling sex ratio. Of these four traits, variation in juvenile survivorship and annual frequency of nesting have the most profound effect on population stability. The yellow mud turtle is well-adapted to life in the seasonal, sometimes harsh, highly unpredictable environments of the Great Plains, but the evidence suggests that variation in several of its life history traits (at least delayed maturity and low reproductive frequency) are primarily under environmental rather than direct genetic control. This plasticity is probably adaptive given the stochastic nature of the environment. The northern limit to the distribution of the species may be related to temperature effects on egg development in the summer or winter survival of hatchlings near the nest.",unkown_8,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Herps,Grassland,1,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = all in abstract.

We use these methods to ask whether closely related consumer species are more likely to attack the same resource species and whether closely related resource species are more likely to be attacked by the same consumer species. We then show how to use estimates of phylogenetic signals to predict novel consumer-resource associations solely from the phylogenetic position of species for which no other (or only partial) data are available. Finally, we show how to combine phylogenetic information with information about species' ecological characteristics and lifehistory traits to estimate the effects of species traits on consumerresource associations while accounting for phylogenies.

Here, we present phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs) that can statistically test a wide variety of phylogenetic patterns in community structure. In contrast to most current statistical approaches that rely on community metrics and randomization tests, PGLMMs are model-based statistics that fit observed presence/absence data to underlying hypotheses about the distributions of species among communities. We built four PGLMMs to address (1) phylogenetic patterns in community composition, (2) phylogenetic variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients among communities, (3) phylogenetic repulsion in which closely related species are less likely to co-occur, and (4) trait-based variation in species sensitivities to environmental gradients. We also built a fifth PGLMM to test a key underlying assumption of phylogenetic community structure: that phylogenetic information serves as a surrogate for trait information about species; this model tests whether the introduction of trait information can explain all variation in species occurrences among communities, leaving no phylogenetic residual variation. We assessed the performance of these PGLMMs using community simulation models and show that PGLMMs have equal or greater statistical power than alternative approaches currently in the literature. Finally, we illustrate the PGLMM advantage of fitting a model to data by showing how variation in species occurrences among communities can be partitioned into phylogenetic and site-specific components, and how fitted models can be used to predict the co-occurrence of phylogenetically related species.",10.1890/10-1264.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,"thought relevant, but only used a 'hypothetical trait' ",
"JACKSON, ME; SEMLITSCH, RD",1993,PEDOMORPHOSIS IN THE SALAMANDER AMBYSTOMA-TALPOIDEUM - EFFECTS OF A FISH PREDATOR,ECOLOGY,"We examined the expression of metamorphic and paedomorphic phenotypes of the salamander Ambystoma talpoideum in relation to a fish predator. We measured the effects of fish density and time of introduction on larval activity, growth, survival, and body size, and the percentage of larvae metamorphosing or becoming paedomorphic, i.e., maturing as larvae. In addition, a laboratory experiment measured refuge use by larvae according to varying amounts of chemical cues from fish. There was no effect of fish density or time of introduction on survival and growth rate of larvae, nor on final density of zooplankton. Percentage of individuals becoming paedomorphic or metamorphosing was positively related to mean body size in ponds. An analysis of covariance, after removing the effect of body size, revealed a significant effect of fish density on the expression of the paedomorphic phenotype, but not on that of metamorphosis. The proportional decline of paedomorphs was related to the increase of larvae. The laboratory experiment indicated that refuge use by larvae was proportional to the amount of fish stimuli. Activity of larvae in the ponds, however, was not affected by fish density, but rather showed that larvae became habituated to fish. Our experiment demonstrated that expression of the paedomorphic phenotype is reduced in the presence of fish, not by increasing the number of metamorphs as expected, but by increasing the number of individuals that remained as larvae. These results indicate that models of amphibian metamorphosis based on growth and mortality are not adequate to explain paedomorphosis. We propose that trade-offs with reproductive traits such as size and age at first reproduction must be incorporated into models predicting metamorphosis as an alternative life history pathway to paedomorphosis.",10.2307/1939297,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Other,Ponds,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,0,0,1,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"taxonomic = amphibean.

There are growing concerns that these kinds of disturbances alter important functions of ecosystems. Our current understanding is that key parameters of a community (e.g. its functional diversity, species composition, and presence/absence of vulnerable species) reflect an ecological network's ability to resist or rebound from change in response to pressures and disturbances, such as species loss. If the food web structure is relatively simple, we can analyse the roles of different species interactions in determining how environmental impacts translate into species loss. However, when ecosystems harbour species-rich communities, as is the case in most natural systems, then the complex network of ecological interactions makes it a far more challenging task to perceive how species' functional roles influence the consequences of species loss. One approach to deal with such complexity is to focus on the functional traits of species in order to identify their respective roles: for instance, large species seem to be more susceptible to extinction than smaller species. Here, we introduce and analyse the marine food web from the high Antarctic Weddell Sea Shelf to illustrate the role of species traits in relation to network robustness of this complex food web. Our approach was threefold: firstly, we applied a new classification system to all species, grouping them by traits other than body size; secondly, we tested the relationship between body size and food web parameters within and across these groups and finally, we calculated food web robustness. We addressed questions regarding (i) patterns of species functional/trophic roles, (ii) relationships between species functional roles and body size and (iii) the role of species body size in terms of network robustness.

Soil fertility clearly influences community composition, but it is unclear which plant functional traits are most strongly associated with gradients of increasing nutrient limitation. We hypothesized that leaf economic traits and stem tissue density would be strongly associated with soil fertility given their direct relationship to soil resource acquisition and use. In contrast, we hypothesized that functional traits that are commonly associated with competition for light (maximum height), shade tolerance (seed mass) and resistance to disturbance (bark thickness) would be unrelated to soil fertility. We measured 13 functional traits from 30 tree species occurring in 40 plots across a soil fertility gradient in a mature warm temperate rain forest in Northland, New Zealand. Principal component analysis was used to assess the dimensionality and independence of the functional traits and the soil properties, and regression was used to determine the relationships between community-weighted mean traits and the soil fertility gradient. We observed a coordinated response of multiple independent traits to soil fertility. Consistent with our hypothesis, species associated with low-fertility soils had comparatively slower' leaves (i.e. low SLA and leaf N and P, and high LDMC and thickness) and higher stem tissue density than species associated with high-fertility soils. Unexpectedly, we observed that species associated with low-fertility soils had larger maximum heights, thicker bark and lower seed mass. Tall trees can persist on poor soils. Thick bark may be a defensive strategy for trees growing in resource-limited sites and large-seeded shade-tolerant species can persist in fertile soils where light is more limiting.Synthesis. Species sorting can occur over short distances in ecosystems where topographically driven variation in soil fertility leads to complete compositional turnover. Inferences about species distributions based on single-trait spectrums can be misleading when environmental gradients sort species by filtering multiple independent traits simultaneously.

The relationship between community structure and the functioning of ecosystems is the subject of ongoing debate. Biological or functional trait-based approaches that capture life strategy, morphology and behavioural characteristics have received far less attention than taxonomic diversity in this context, despite their more intuitive link to ecosystem functioning. 2. Macrophyte primary production underpins aquatic food webs, regulates benthic and pelagic ecosystems and is a key aspect of the global carbon cycle. This study spans a range of aquatic biomes across Europe and aims to examine potential for predicting primary production of macrophyte communities based on the functional traits of species and identify the traits that are the most informative indicators of macrophyte production. 3. Macrophyte primary production was assessed based on the oxygen production of the whole community, linked to biomasses of selected biological traits derived of its component species and analysed using the novel boosted regression trees modelling technique. 4. Results showed that functional traits derived from macrophyte community data explained most of the variation in primary production of macrophyte communities without the need to incorporate environmental data on the habitats. Macrophyte primary production was influenced by a combination of tolerance, morphology and life habit traits; however tolerance traits contributed most of variability in macrophyte primary production when all traits were analysed jointly. 5. This study also showed the existence of trait clustering as the studied trait categories were not fully independent; strong interlinkages between and within trait categories emerged. 6. Our study suggests that functional trait analysis captures different aspects of ecosystem functioning and thereby enables assessing primary production of macrophyte communities over geographically distinct areas without extensive taxonomic and environmental data.

It remains an open question as to how they survived Pleistocene climatic fluctuations characterised by repeated advances of continental glaciers as far as the shelf break that probably resulted in a loss of habitat for benthic organisms. Pelagic ecosystems, on the other hand, might have flourished during glacial maxima due to the northward expansion of Antarctic polar waters. In order to better understand the role of ecological traits in Quaternary climatic fluctuations, we performed demographic analyses of populations of four fish species from the tribe Trematominae, including both fully benthic and pelagic species using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and an intron from the nuclear S7 gene. Results: Nuclear and cytoplasmic markers showed differences in the rate and time of population expansions as well as the likely population structure. Neutrality tests suggest that such discordance comes from different coalescence dynamics of each marker, rather than from selective pressure. Demographic analyses based on intraspecific DNA diversity suggest a recent population expansion in both benthic species, dated by the cyt b locus to the last glacial cycle, whereas the population structure of pelagic feeders either did not deviate from a constant-size model or indicated that the onset of the major population expansion of these species by far predated those of the benthic species. Similar patterns were apparent even when comparing previously published data on other Southern Ocean organisms, but we observed considerable heterogeneity within both groups with regard to the onset of major demographic events and rates. Conclusion: Our data suggest benthic and pelagic species reacted differently to the Pleistocene ice-sheet expansions that probably significantly reduced the suitable habitat for benthic species. However, the asynchronous timing of major demographic events observed in different species within both ""ecological guilds"", imply that the species examined here may have different population and evolutionary histories, and that more species should be analysed in order to more precisely assess the role of life history in the response of organisms to climatic changes.",10.1186/1471-2148-7-220,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Subfossil cladoceran communities were found to have suffered species loss due to both the degree of heterogeneity in the lake and taphonomical processes. The remains of heavily chitinized species are those most commonly found in the sediment, and therefore bias communities reconstructed on this basis. These biases are mostly caused by: (1) parts of soft bodied filterers (Daphniidae, Moinidae, Sididae (Diaphanosoma)), which are underrepresented in the subfossil remains of cladocerans, and (2) the remains of species that are difficult to collect and, so, underrepresented or absent in contemporary samples; this may have a strong effect on diversity indices. In spite of such biases, the paleocommunity does reflect the functioning of the ecosystem. The subfossil cladoceran community in the Morotva-to (MT) corresponded to low fish densities and the high macrophyte coverage, indicating weaker top-down forces in this oxbow.

"Jansen, Jan; Hill, Nicole A; Dunstan, Piers K; Eleaume, Marc P; Johnson, Craig R",2018,"Taxonomic Resolution, Functional Traits, and the Influence of Species Groupings on Mapping Antarctic Seafloor Biodiversity",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Benthic marine biodiversity on the Antarctic continental shelf is high and unique, yet its distributional patterns are still relatively poorly understood. Some of the main issues are that biological data are sparse, and that many species are rare and seem only weakly related to environmental conditions. Grouping species by taxonomic or functional similarity has historically been used to compensate for missing species identification, to generate a more widespread distribution of data-points, and this practice can help to gain a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity. However, there are few guidelines on how to group species, the implicit assumptions about species associations in the groups are difficult to validate, and the information loss associated with grouping species is unknown. Here, we analyse whether grouping benthic macrofaunal species by taxonomic or functional similarity preserves distributional patterns seen in species distributions, using a model-based approach called species archetype model that groups species or other units based on the similarity in their responses to environmental factors. Using presence-absence data, the species archetype models identify twice as many assemblages when used on the highest taxonomic resolution data, than when applied to taxonomic data at lower resolution (e.g., class) or functional groups based on mobility, feeding type, and body shape. Further, confidence in the predictions of either taxonomic or functional groups is far less than for predictions based on the highest taxonomic resolution data. Although using functional groups is often thought to accumulate species with similar environmental responses, our analysis shows that functional groups may insufficiently resolve assemblage structure for presence-absence data. Model-based approaches provide key information to understanding the regional distribution of Antarctic marine biodiversity, and care needs to be taken when using a-priori groupings of species to make statements about the distribution of biodiversity.

"Jauker, B; Krauss, J; Jauker, F; Steffan-Dewenter, I",2013,Linking life history traits to pollinator loss in fragmented calcareous grasslands,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"To gain insight into the drivers of pollinator loss, a holistic approach to land-use change including habitat size, isolation, habitat quality and the surrounding landscape matrix is necessary. Moreover, species' responses to land-use change may differ depending on their life history traits such as dispersal ability, trophic level, or sociality. We assessed species richness and life history traits of wild bees in 32 calcareous grasslands in central Germany that differ in size, connectivity, resource availability and landscape context. Declining habitat area and, to a lesser degree, reduced diversity of the surrounding landscape were the key factors negatively influencing species richness. In the community-wide analysis, small body size and solitary reproduction were traits that made species particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. Contrary to our expectations, cleptoparasitic species were not more affected by reduced habitat area and landscape diversity than nest-building species. We performed further detailed trait analyses within the family Halictidae to prevent possible confounding effects due to trait correlations across families. Here, social as opposed to solitary species were more affected by habitat loss. We conclude that the opposite pattern observed for all social bees was mainly caused by large-sized social bumblebee species with high mobility and large foraging distances. Our results demonstrate the risks of concealed trait interference when analyzing community-wide patterns of life history traits. As a consequence, conservation requirements of small social bee species might be overlooked by generalizations from community responses.",10.1007/s10980-012-9820-6,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Insects,Grasslands,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = dispersal ability, sociality and trophic level.

"Jenkins, DG",2011,Ranked species occupancy curves reveal common patterns among diverse metacommunities,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aim Community ecologists often compare assemblages. Alternatively, one may compare species distributions among assemblages for macroecological comparisons of species niche traits and dispersal abilities, which are consistent with metacommunity theory and a regional community concept. The aim of this meta-analysis is to use regressions of ranked species occupancy curves (RSOCs) among diverse metacommunities and to consider the common patterns observed. Location Diverse data sets from four continents are analysed. Methods Six regression models were translated from traditional occupancy frequency distributions (OFDs) and are distributed among four equation families. Each regression model was fitted to each of 24 data sets and compared using the Akaike information criterion. The analysed data sets encompass a wide range of spatial scales (5 cm-50 km grain, 2-7000 km extent), study scales (11-590 species, 6-5114 sites) and taxa. Observed RSOC regressions were tested for the differences in scale and taxa. Results Three RSOC models within two equation families (exponential and sigmoidal) are required to describe the very different data sets. This result is generally consistent with OFD research, but unlike OFD-based expectations the simple RSOC patterns are not related to spatial scale or other factors. Species occupancy in diverse metacommunities is efficiently summarized with RSOCs, and multi-model inference reliably distinguishes among alternative RSOCs. Main conclusions RSOCs are simple to generate and analyse and clearly identified surprisingly similar patterns among very different metacommunities. Species-specific hypotheses (e.g. niche-based factors and dispersal abilities) that depend on spatial scale may not translate to diverse metacommunities that sample regional communities. A novel set of three metacommunity succession and disturbance hypotheses potentially explain RSOC patterns and should be tested in subsequent research. RSOCs are an operational approach to the regional community concept and should be useful in macroecology and metacommunity ecology.",10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00617.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

This may be a lateralized preference for using one structure of a bilateral trait during display or physical attack, or for keeping the opponent in one visual field. Alternatively, it may be the case that behavioural lateralization and the degree of symmetry expressed by bilateral structures are correlated forms of developmental instability. We examined whether there was an association between lateralization during a lateral display and different measurements of antler size and symmetry (beam length, beam circumference, brow tine length and coronet circumference). Three models addressed different structural measures: the right antler, the larger antler and antler symmetry. Results showed that beam length was negatively associated with behavioural lateralization irrespective of structural measure. A second analysis using a composite score of the four antler measurements, one for each structural measure, showed that only antler symmetry was negatively associated with lateralization during lateral display. Therefore, our second prediction was supported. We discuss these findings in relation to predator detection capability and stress reduction in prey species such as the fallow deer.",10.1080/1357650X.2017.1293074,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Mammals,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = lateralization during display, antler (beam length, beam circumference, brow tine length and coronet circumference).

"Jennings, S; Collingridge, K",2015,"Predicting Consumer Biomass, Size-Structure, Production, Catch Potential, Responses to Fishing and Associated Uncertainties in the World's Marine Ecosystems",PLOS ONE,"Existing estimates of fish and consumer biomass in the world's oceans are disparate. This creates uncertainty about the roles of fish and other consumers in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem processes, the extent of human and environmental impacts and fishery potential. We develop and use a size-based macroecological model to assess the effects of parameter uncertainty on predicted consumer biomass, production and distribution. Resulting uncertainty is large (e.g. median global biomass 4.9 billion tonnes for consumers weighing 1 g to 1000 kg; 50% uncertainty intervals of 2 to 10.4 billion tonnes; 90% uncertainty intervals of 0.3 to 26.1 billion tonnes) and driven primarily by uncertainty in trophic transfer efficiency and its relationship with predator-prey body mass ratios. Even the upper uncertainty intervals for global predictions of consumer biomass demonstrate the remarkable scarcity of marine consumers, with less than one part in 30 million by volume of the global oceans comprising tissue of macroscopic animals. Thus the apparently high densities of marine life seen in surface and coastal waters and frequently visited abundance hotspots will likely give many in society a false impression of the abundance of marine animals. Unexploited baseline biomass predictions from the simple macroecological model were used to calibrate a more complex size-and trait-based model to estimate fisheries yield and impacts. Yields are highly dependent on baseline biomass and fisheries selectivity. Predicted global sustainable fisheries yield increases approximate to 4 fold when smaller individuals (< 20 cm from species of maximum mass < 1kg) are targeted in all oceans, but the predicted yields would rarely be accessible in practice and this fishing strategy leads to the collapse of larger species if fishing mortality rates on different size classes cannot be decoupled. Our analyses show that models with minimal parameter demands that are based on a few established ecological principles can support equitable analysis and comparison of diverse ecosystems. The analyses provide insights into the effects of parameter uncertainty on global biomass and production estimates, which have yet to be achieved with complex models, and will therefore help to highlight priorities for future research and data collection. However, the focus on simple model structures and global processes means that non-phytoplankton primary production and several groups, structures and processes of ecological and conservation interest are not represented. Consequently, our simple models become increasingly less useful than more complex alternatives when addressing questions about food web structure and function, biodiversity, resilience and human impacts at smaller scales and for areas closer to coasts.",10.1371/journal.pone.0133794,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Marine,Broad,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,1,Exploitation,0,0,1,1,traits = body size,

Ecological and population processes are affected by large-scale climatic fluctuations, and top predators such as seabirds can provide an integrative view on the consequences of environmental variability on ecosystems. Here, we examine the dynamics of a southern fulmar population in Antarctica over a 39-year period and evaluate the impact of environmental variability on the life history traits of this top predator species. 2. Between 1963 and 2002, the number of breeding pairs fluctuated between seven and 53 in relation to variations in sea ice concentration, and increased overall (annual growth rate: 1.0035). Breeding performance tended to be lower in years with low sea ice concentration. The proportion of birds attempting to breed varied strongly from one year to the next despite the birds were alive, indicating strong environmental forcing on the decision to breed. The number of new local recruits and immigrants was correlated highly with the number of local breeders, and capture probabilities were positively related to the breeding population size. Local recruitment, number of local breeders and proportion of birds attempting to breed were lower when sea ice concentration during summer was low. 3. Adult survival between 1964 and 2002 was on average 0.923 +/- 0.006, and decreased during years with high sea surface temperature and low sea ice concentration. 4. Modelled population growth rate, estimated using matrix models, of the population was 0.9728, a difference of 3.6% compared to the observed rate of increase. This discrepancy is due probably to the immigration rate (3 +/- 3%). 5. Demographic parameters were affected by sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature anomalies, probably through an impact on krill availability, the main prey of southern fulmars. During warm anomalies, birds skip breeding probably because the food availability was low and limiting for the highly energy demanding reproductive activities. 6. We also emphasize that demographic parameters were very low during the period 1975-80 and showed a higher variability after 1980, which could be interpreted in the context of a regime shift. Our study indicates that the southern fulmar population dynamics may be very susceptible to environmental variability. Further long-lasting warm anomalies are likely to affect negatively their populations.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00727.x,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Marine,Birds,Polar,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"traits = growth rate, mortality rate",
"Jensen, Ashley M.; Schamp, Brandon S.; Belleau, Angela",2019,Evidence of temporal niche separation via low flowering time overlap in an old-field plant community,OECOLOGIA,"Flowering time is a trait that reflects the timing of specific resource requirements by plants. Consequently, several predictions have been made related to how species are assembled within communities according to flowering time. Strong overlap in flowering time among coexisting species may result from clustered abiotic resources, or contribute to improved pollination success. Conversely, low flowering time overlap (asynchrony) among coexisting species may reduce competition for soil, light, or pollinator resources and alleviate interspecific pollen transfer. Here, we present evidence that coexisting species in an old-field community generally overlap less in flowering time than expected under a commonly used and statistically validated null model. Flowering time asynchrony was more pronounced when abundance data were used (compared to presence-absence data), and when analyses focused on species that share bees as pollinators. Control and herbivore-exclusion plots did not differ in flowering time overlap, providing no evidence of the reduction in overlap expected to result from increased competition. Our results varied with the randomization algorithm used, emphasizing that the choice of algorithm can influence the outcome of null models. Our results varied between 2years, with patterns being less clear in the second year, when both growing season and flowering times were contracted. Finally, we found evidence that further supports a previous finding that higher plot-level flowering time overlap was associated with higher proportions of introduced species. Reduced flowering time overlap among species in our focal community may promote coexistence via temporal niche differentiation and reduced competition for pollinators and other abiotic resources.",10.1007/s00442-019-04386-0,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,trait = flowering time,

According to the stomach contents, the S. trutta changed their diet at c. 30 cm total length (LT). The smaller size classes fed on benthic invertebrates and surface insects, whereas larger S. trutta (>30 cm) fed mainly on whitefish Coregonus lavaretus. A similar, but more gradual shift to piscivory in the size range 2530 cm was found when using the stable isotope mixing model SIAR to reveal dietary ontogeny. The d13C isotopic signature confirmed that S. trutta independent of size predominantly relied upon benthic energy sources, suggesting that the littoral zone was the primary foraging habitat for both invertebrate and piscivorous feeders. The d15N values and trophic position increased with predator length, ranging from an average of 3.60 for small-sized S. trutta (<15 cm) to 4.15 for large-sized fish (>35 cm).

Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones affect multiple physiological and behavioural traits regulating the responses of vertebrates to stressors. Current understanding of what influences GC stress response variation among species is poor. However, identifying environmental causes of species-level variation in the GC stress response is important to understanding macroevolutionary patterns in this key physiological system and potentially offers a metric for evaluating species risk to global change. We tested whether GC stress response of 22 reptile and 66 bird species exposed to a uniform capture stress protocol could be predicted from a GC stressor space model. This model predicts that species-level variation in GCs results from multivariate selection from environmental gradients and species-specific metabolic sensitivities. Thus, these multivariate selection interactions delimit the cumulative selection intensity causing GC stress response variation among vertebrates. Using phylogenetic generalized least square regression analysis, we ranked models incorporating putative variables pertaining to the corticosterone stress response (CSR) for reptiles and birds separately. The top-ranked models explained between 14% and 33% of species variation in the CSR. Models indicated that combinations of variables including increasing body mass, net primary productivity and latitude influenced GC stress responsiveness in reptiles and birds. We conclude that GC stress response variation among species represents, in part, evolution to species-specific traits and large-scale environmental variation. Further improvement to predicting species variation in GC stress response could be achieved by expanding our stressor space model to integrate microevolutionary and ecological processes. There is a pressing need to identify physiological traits that predict species responses to environmental change. Conceptually, the use of plasma GC levels as a species-specific marker for environmental tolerance could be plausible. However, we identify three major knowledge gaps and ensuing research areas to aid understanding of the utility of variation in GC stress response as a metric for inferring how species might respond to global change.",10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02057.x,Y,1,0,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Multiple,Broad,1,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Global Change Broad,0,1,1,1,"traits = Coricosterone stress responsiveness.

"Jiang, Y.; Moller, A. P.",2017,Escape from predators and genetic variance in birds,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Predation is a common cause of death in numerous organisms, and a host of antipredator defences have evolved. Such defences often have a genetic background as shown by significant heritability and microevolutionary responses towards weaker defences in the absence of predators. Flight initiation distance (FID) is the distance at which an individual animal takes flight when approached by a human, and hence, it reflects the life-history compromise between risk of predation and the benefits of foraging. Here, we analysed FID in 128 species of birds in relation to three measures of genetic variation, band sharing coefficient for minisatellites, observed heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient for microsatellites in order to test whether FID was positively correlated with genetic variation. We found consistently shorter FID for a given body size in the presence of high band sharing coefficients, low heterozygosity and high inbreeding coefficients in phylogenetic analyses after controlling statistically for potentially confounding variables. These findings imply that antipredator behaviour is related to genetic variance. We predict that many threatened species with low genetic variability will show reduced antipredator behaviour and that subsequent predator-induced reductions in abundance may contribute to unfavourable population trends for such species.",10.1111/jeb.13175,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Identifying reliable predictors of species resilience or susceptibility to climate warming is of critical importance in assessing potential risks to species, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here we analysed long-term trends of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (20 countries), to identify climate niche characteristics, adjusted to other environmental and life history traits, that predict large-scale population changes accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species. Beyond the now well-documented decline of farmland specialists, we found that species with the lowest thermal maxima (as the mean spring and summer temperature of the hottest part of the breeding distribution in Europe) showed the sharpest declines between 1980 and 2005. Thermal maximum predicted the recent trends independently of other potential predictors. This study emphasizes the need to account for both land-use and climate changes to assess the fate of species.

The observed structure of community assemblages is the result of deterministic abiotic (environmental constraints) and biotic factors (positive and negative species interactions), as well as stochastic colonization events (historical contingency). We analyzed the role of multi-scale spatial component of soil environmental variability in structuring earthworm assemblages in a gallery forest from the Colombian ""Llanos"". We aimed to disentangle the spatial scales at which species assemblages are structured and determine whether these scales matched those expressed by soil environmental variables. We also tested the hypothesis of the ""single tree effect"" by exploring the spatial relationships between root-related variables and soil nutrient and physical variables in structuring earthworm assemblages. Multivariate ordination techniques and spatially explicit tools were used, namely cross-correlograms, Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrices (PCNM) and variation partitioning analyses. Results: The relationship between the spatial organization of earthworm assemblages and soil environmental parameters revealed explicitly multi-scale responses. The soil environmental variables that explained nested population structures across the multi-spatial scale gradient differed for earthworms and assemblages at the very-fine- (<10 m) to medium-scale (10-20 m). The root traits were correlated with areas of high soil nutrient contents at a depth of 0-5 cm. Information on the scales of PCNM variables was obtained using variogram modeling. Based on the size of the plot, the PCNM variables were arbitrarily allocated to medium (>30 m), fine (10-20 m) and very fine scales (<10 m). Variation partitioning analysis revealed that the soil environmental variability explained from less than 1% to as much as 48% of the observed earthworm spatial variation.

As a response to this bias, we discuss the functional significance of seed germination traits in comparison with morphological and biophysical seed traits, and advocate their use in vegetation science. We also demonstrate how research in community assembly, climate change and restoration ecology can benefit from the inclusion of germination traits, encompassing functions that cannot be explained solely by adult plant traits. Seed germination experiments conducted in the laboratory or field to quantify these traits provide ecologically meaningful and relatively easy-to-obtain information about the functional properties of plant communities.

Despite the preparation of the restoration site by ploughing or grubbing, the establishment window is usually open for only a short time period and germination as well as establishment of the sown target species is often hampered by dense vegetation stands and related low above-ground light-availability. However, concepts how to manage freshly sown sites differ widely. In the Elbe lowland plain (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany), we tested the effects of three different cutting treatments (cut once, twice, three times), three nitrogen fertilization treatments (120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 60 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), without fertilization), rolling versus no rolling as well as species-trait affiliation on the establishment of sown target species in a species-poor, grass-dominated hay meadow using a split-split-plot design. Eighteen target species were sown into ploughed and grubbed plots in autumn. In the following year, individuals of each sown species were counted in microplots before the first and after the last cutting date. The treatment effects as well as the species-trait affiliation were tested using generalized linear mixed models and principal component analysis.Cutting three times significantly enhanced the number of established target species compared to cutting once showing the importance of biomass removal after species re-introduction into productive hay meadows. Compared to control plots, the 120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) fertilization led to a lower number of established target species as well as individuals, whereas moderate fertilization did not hamper the establishment success significantly. Rolling did not show a significant effect.

J.; Vellend, Mark; Stinchcombe, John R.",2009,Evolution in plant populations as a driver of ecological changes in arthropod communities,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Heritable variation in traits can have wide-ranging impacts on species interactions, but the effects that ongoing evolution has on the temporal ecological dynamics of communities are not well understood. Here, we identify three conditions that, if experimentally satisfied, support the hypothesis that evolution by natural selection can drive ecological changes in communities. These conditions are: (i) a focal population exhibits genetic variation in a trait(s), (ii) there is measurable directional selection on the trait(s), and (iii) the trait(s) under selection affects variation in a community variable(s). When these conditions are met, we expect evolution by natural selection to cause ecological changes in the community. We tested these conditions in a field experiment examining the interactions between a native plant (Oenothera biennis) and its associated arthropod community (more than 90 spp.). Oenothera biennis exhibited genetic variation in several plant traits and there was directional selection on plant biomass, life-history strategy (annual versus biennial reproduction) and herbivore resistance. Genetically based variation in biomass and life-history strategy consistently affected the abundance of common arthropod species, total arthropod abundance and arthropod species richness. Using two modelling approaches, we show that evolution by natural selection in large O. biennis populations is predicted to cause changes in the abundance of individual arthropod species, increases in the total abundance of arthropods and a decline in the number of arthropod species. In small O. biennis populations, genetic drift is predicted to swamp out the effects of selection, making the evolution of plant populations unpredictable. In short, evolution by natural selection can play an important role in affecting the dynamics of communities, but these effects depend on several ecological factors. The framework presented here is general and can be applied to other systems to examine the community-level effects of ongoing evolution.",10.1098/rstb.2008.0334,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal.

Proboscis length has been proposed as a key dimension of plant pollination niches, but this niche space has not previously been explored at regional and global scales for any pollination system. Hawkmoths are ideal organisms for exploring pollinator niches as they are important pollinators in most of the biodiverse regions of the earth and vary greatly in proboscis length, with some species having the longest proboscides of all insects. 2. Using data sets for nine biogeographical regions spanning the Old and New World, we ask whether it is possible to identify distinct hawkmoth pollination niches based on the frequency distribution of proboscis length, and whether these niches are reflected in the depths of flowers that are pollinated by hawkmoths. We also investigate the levels of specialization in hawkmoth pollination systems at the regional and community level using data from interaction network studies. 3. We found that most regional hawkmoth assemblages have bimodal or multimodal distributions of proboscis length and that these are matched by similar distributions of floral tube lengths. Hawkmoths, particularly those with longer proboscides, are polyphagous and at the network level show foraging specialization equivalent to or less than that of bees and hummingbirds. In the case of plants, shorter-tubed flowers are usually visited by numerous hawkmoth species, while those that are longer-tubed tend to exclude shorter-proboscid hawkmoths and thus become ecologically specialized on longer-proboscid hawkmoth species. Longer-tubed flowers tend to have greater nectar rewards, and this promotes short-term constancy by longproboscid hawkmoths. 4. Our results show that pollinator proboscis length is a key niche axis for plants and can account for the patterns of evolution in functional traits such as floral tube length and nectar volume. We also highlight a paradoxical trend for nectar resource niche breadth to increase according to proboscis length of pollinators, while pollinator niche breadth decreases according to the tube length of flowers.",10.1111/1365-2435.12753,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,1,1,1,"trait = proboscis length, foraging specialization.

Principal Component Analysis was used to create new variables from species abundance data collected in a seine survey on the Maine coast. The new variables were related to wave-energy values created for each site from available wind speed and fetch data. The results show a strong relationship between potential wave energy experienced and the species composition at a location. There were two scales of importance in determining species assemblages. First is at the regional scale where wave energy and the resulting coastal geomorphology create barriers to certain species and act to maintain different species groups. Second is at the local scale where wave energy interacts with species traits to create differences in species assemblages within a specific bay. The structure in fish communities delineated through this analysis provides a biodiversity indicator and the relationship between this indicator and an easily estimated physical quantity allows area-based management concepts to be better designed.

Understanding the functional role of species in food webs is of fundamental interests. This is related to food web position, so positional similarity may provide information about functional overlap. Defining and quantifying similar trophic functioning can be addressed in different ways. We consider two approaches. One is of mathematical nature involving network analysis where unique species can be defined as those whose topological position is very different to others in the same food web. A species is unique if it has very different connection pattern compared to others. The second approach is of biological nature, based on trait-based aggregations. Unique species are not easy to aggregate with others because their traits are not in common with the ones of most others. Our goal here is to illustrate how mathematics can provide an alternative perspective on species aggregation, and how this is related to its biological counterpart.

Tadpole assemblages offer an excellent system to understand the relative influence of intraspecific and interspecific variability on community assembly, due to their high phenotypic plasticity, and the strong influence that environmental variables have on their spatial distribution and individual performance. Here, we quantified the intraspecific and interspecific components of tadpoles' trait variability in order to investigate their relative role in shaping tadpole communities. We selected eight functional traits related to microhabitat use, foraging strategies, and swimming ability. We measured these traits on 678 individuals from 22 species captured in 43 ponds in the Atlantic Forest. We used single- and multitrait analyses to decompose trait variability. To explore the action of external and internal filtering on community assembly, we used a variance decomposition approach that compares phenotypic variability at the individual, population, community and regional levels. On average, 33% of trait variability was due to within-species variation. This decomposition varied widely among traits. We found only a reduced effect of external filtering (low variation in the height of the ventral fin within ponds in comparison to the total variation), whereas the internal filtering was stronger than expected. Traits related to the use of different microhabitats through the water column were generally less variable than traits related to swimming ability to escape of predators, with tail traits being highly variable within species.

Firstly, natural mortality is the selection under which fish evolved in the first place, so a theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in some fished stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We therefore analyse a model for evolution of fish life histories and behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into five different components, each specified as the outcome of individual traits and ecological tradeoffs: a fixed baseline mortality; size-dependent predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a fixed mortality when sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment. The analysis is repeated with and without fishing. Each component of natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies. Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable depending on the type of mortality changed.

Trait-based approaches applied to community ecology have led to a considerable advance in understanding the effect of environmental filters on species assembly. Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation. 2. We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits - specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and height - in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient. We quantified the contribution of intraspecific variability relative to interspecific differences in the trait-gradient relationship, and we used a null model approach to detect patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation, with and without intraspecific variability. 3. Community mean SLA and height varied significantly along the flooding gradient and intraspecific variability accounted for 44% and 32%, respectively, of these trait-gradient relationships. LDMC did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for SLA and height, but not for LDMC. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes. 4. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters.

Network analysis facilitates the compilation and understanding of the complexity found in natural ecosystems and is a powerful tool to reveal information on the degree of specialization of the interacting partners and their niches. The indices measuring these properties are based on qualitative or quantitative observations of interactions between partners from different trophic levels, which informs about the structure of network patterns, but not about the underlying mechanisms. Functional traits may control the interaction strength between partners and also the (micro-) structure of networks. Here, we ask whether flower visitors specialize on certain plant traits and how this trait specialization contributes to niche partitioning and interaction partner diversity. We introduce two novel statistical approaches suited to evaluate the dimension of the realized niche and to analyse which traits determine niches. As basis for our analysis, we measured 10 quantitative flower traits and evaluated whether 31 arthropod taxa i visited flowers displaying only subsets of the available trait characteristics, indicating a specialization on these traits by narrow trait-widths Si. The product of 10 trait- and species-specific trait-widths Si was defined as trait-volume Vi (expansion of a n-dimensional hypervolume) occupied by each taxon i. These indices are applicable beyond flowervisitor interactions to quantify realized niches based on various biotic and abiotic factors. Each flower visitor species showed some degree of specialization to a unique set of flower traits (realized niche). Overall, our data suggested a hierarchical sequence of flower traits influencing the flower visitors' behaviour and thus network structure: flowering phenology was found to have the strongest effect, followed by flower height, nectar-tube depth and floral reflectance. Less important were pollen-mass/flower, sugar/flower, anther position, phylogeny, display size and abundance. The species-specific specialization on traits suggests that plant communities with more diverse floral niches may sustain a larger number of flower visitors with non-redundant fundamental niches.

Whereas vegetative traits reflecting adaptations to environmental conditions are commonly assessed in community ecology, floral traits are often neglected despite their importance for the plants' life cycle. The consideration of floral traits covers important aspects such as sexual plant reproduction and pollinator diversity, which remain unobserved in studies focussing on vegetative traits only. To test whether vegetative and floral traits differ in their responses to elevation, we measured morphological and chemical traits of plant species occurring in pastures at seven elevations in the Austrian Alps. Variation in functional composition was examined using the concept of n-dimensional hypervolumes and vector analysis. Our data show that vegetative and floral traits vary differently with the elevational gradient. Whereas vegetative traits changed in a predictable manner with elevation, floral traits did not specifically respond to elevation. Overall variation in vegetative traits mainly resulted from phenotypical differences between plants in different elevations, whereas total variation in floral traits was a result from a high variation within communities. The assessment of functional changes in vegetative and floral traits along mountain slopes thus reveals different patterns in plant responses to elevation and may help to generate testable hypotheses on functional responses to current climate warming.",10.1007/s00035-017-0198-6,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Alpine,1,1,1,0,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,0,1,"traits =  leaf widths, leaf lengths, and thicknessl, leaf area, Specific leaf wegiht, leaf lobation, plant height, display size of flowers, width and depth of nectar tubes, position of anthers, flower inclination, (display size, width, and depth) of nectar tubes, floral scent bouquet, scent emission per plant per hour.

Alternative hypotheses suggest that under certain conditions, species may become phenotypically similar and functionally equivalent, which invokes the possibility of other mechanisms, such as habitat filtering processes. To test these hypotheses, we examined the coexistence of the giant redfin Pseudobarbus skeltoni, a newly described freshwater fish, together with its congener Pseudobabus burchelli and an anabantid Sandelia capensis by assessing their scenopoetic and bionomic patterns. We found high habitat and isotope niche overlaps between the two redfins, rendering niche partitioning a less plausible sole mechanism that drives their coexistence. By comparison, environment-trait relationships revealed differences in species-environment relationships, making habitat filtering and functional equivalence less likely alternatives. Based on P. skeltoni's high habitat niche overlap with other species, and its large isotope niche width, we inferred the likelihood of differential resource utilization at trophic level as an alternative mechanism that distinguished it from its congener. In comparison, its congener P. burchelli appeared to have a relatively small trophic niche, suggesting that its trophic niche was more conserved despite being the most abundant species. By contrast, S. capensis was distinguished by occupying a higher trophic position and by having a trophic niche that had a low probability of overlapping onto those of redfins. Therefore, trophic niche partitioning appeared to influence the coexistence between S. capensis and redfins.

Optimal life-history solutions were sought for environmental conditions where different life stages of the moth were subject to predation and other known fitness-reducing factors in a manner that was dependent on the duration of these life stages and on variable mortality rates. We found that multi-objective optimal solutions to these conditions that the moths regularly experience explained most of the life-history variation within this species.

Although this idea is widely recognized among biologists, organisms are more tangibly studied when those parts are considered independently. This reductionist approach has successfully advanced our understanding of organisms' performance. However, performance of one system might (or might not) be dependent on performance of another system to achieve a relevant outcome, and the mechanism of this dependence is poorly understood. We synthesize the concepts of complexity and integration and discuss their application in a biomechanical context. Capture of prey by predatory fishes is used as an example to highlight the application of these ideas. We provide a theoretical framework for future hypotheses of integration and predict an ""integration space"" for fishes that is then populated with data extracted from the literature. Additionally, using the kinematics of prey-capture in two species of sculpin (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae), we show that species exhibit multivariate integration in distinct ways, and that these differences add additional insight into ecological divergence that would not be apparent by considering systems independently. Finally, we discuss new insights into organismal performance gained through the study of integration as an emergent property of kinematic systems working together during a common task.

To help resolve this debate, we reviewed the published literature on plant defense-heteropteran interactions using both vote-counting and meta-analytical approaches. The Heteroptera are ideal for this analysis because as a group they are broadly omnivorous, critical in the biocontrol of crop pests, and frequently come in contact with plants varying in quality. We identified 37 studies that matched our search criteria, involving at least 16 species of Heteroptera. Overall, plant resistance lowered the abundance of heteropterans in the field, but had virtually no impact on their performance when reared in the lab (aside from a significant, albeit minor, increase in development time). Prey consumption was strongly affected by plant resistance; however, the outcome was extremely variable with near equal evidence for increasing (22 cases) vs. decreasing (21 cases) predation on resistant host-plants. Thus, prey consumption is far more variable across plant-types differing in quality when compared with either abundance or performance. Heteropteran family and developmental stage (adult vs. nymph) were poor predictors of the outcome for prey suppression. Our results indicate that the feeding ecology of omnivorous heteropterans is highly contingent on plant defense expression, more so than other ecologically-relevant traits, but the factors mediating behavioral shifts in prey consumption remain elusive.

Here, we study the processes following the destruction of vegetation after a volcanic eruption. Specifically, we investigate (1) the temporal patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity over time since a previous eruption (alpha diversity) and beta diversity, (2) the temporal patterns of 26 individual traits (vegetative characteristics, plant taxa ecological preferences, and regenerative characteristics) providing more detailed information on species strategies at the initial and later stages of succession, and (3) the processes driving species assembly and whether they changed over time since the eruption an eruption. We analyzed data recorded during five floristic censuses that took place between 1911 and 2011, calculated alpha and beta facets of taxonomic and functional diversity and examined how community structure changed over time, using 26 functional characteristics, based on their ability to discern primary from later colonists, including longevity, growth form, Ellenberg's indicator values, seed production and weight, flower size and sex, pollination type, and dispersal mode. Null model analysis was used to test whether the observed functional diversity deviates from random expectations. Alpha diversity, both taxonomic and functional, increased over time after an eruption, while beta diversity did not display a clear trend. This finding indicates that mainly abiotic processes determine species assembly over time after an eruption (at least for the time span studied here), contrary to theoretical expectations. It is most interesting that, simultaneously, some aspects of diversity indicated the effect of biotic interactions (facilitation and competition) on the assembly of species a few years after an eruption. This finding implies a legacy effect, since a high percentage of perennial species was noticed in the assemblage right after the eruption, as well as the effect of the harsh environmental conditions on the assembly of the plant communities. In conclusion, our results indicate the role of legacy effects in succession (most probably through the survival of underground plant parts) and underline the importance of disturbance history in providing the context needed for understanding effects of past events on succession.",10.1002/ecs2.2374,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = longevity, maximum plant height, mean leaf length, mean leaf width, leaf length/width ratio, life‐form, growth form, leaf surface texture, and canopy structure., flowering period start, flowering period end, flowering period length, seed production, seed weight, flower size, flower sex, pollination type, fruit type, and dispersal mode traits",

How does sampling scale affect the strength that each assembly mechanism poses on the assembly of plant communities? LocationVolcanic islands (Palea Kameni and Nea Kameni) of Santorini Archipelago, Greece. MethodsFunctional diversity has been proposed as a framework for discriminating among mechanisms of community assembly, such as habitat filtering, limiting similarity and random assembly. We investigated four plant communities in two sea-born volcanic islands. We recorded plant diversity at scales from 1m(2) to 64m(2). We calculated three indices of functional diversity: functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence, using 26 functional traits (including vegetative characteristics, ecological preferences and regenerative characteristics). We used null model analysis to test for two different assembly mechanisms: habitat filtering and limiting similarity or random assembly. ResultsThe assemblage of the four communities was complex and did not follow a single mechanism. In most cases, finer-scale patterns indicated randomness, while coarser scales revealed more structured communities. In the older island, the scrub community was mainly defined by limiting similarity. The therophytic community displayed a limited range of functional traits, indicating mainly habitat filtering, but within this range, the evenness of the distribution indicated limiting similarity. On the younger island, the range of traits did not differ from random. However, within this range of traits, one therophytic community showed signs of limiting similarity, while the second therophytic community displayed uneven functional trait distribution, indicating mainly habitat filtering. The three indices reflected different facets of functional diversity and were not correlated, thus we may argue that they are not redundant, and we even detected different mechanisms of assembly within the same community. ConclusionsThe functional diversity of the therophytic communities in the younger island implied no specific assembly mechanism; perhaps due to its age, the community is still at the early stages of colonization (i.e. stochastic processes, such as arrival of new species, prevail). In the older island, the lack of disturbances for a long period allowed the establishment of communities assembled by specific mechanisms, such as competition and habitat filtering.",10.1111/jvs.12255,,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,0,0,1,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,2,"traits = longevity, maximum plant height, mean leaf length, mean leaf width, leaf length/width ratio, life‐form, growth form, leaf surface texture, and canopy structure., flowering period start, flowering period end, flowering period length, seed production, seed weight, flower size, flower sex, pollination type, fruit type, and dispersal mode traits",
"Karkarey, Rucha; Alcoverro, Teresa; Kumar, Sanjeev; Arthur, Rohan",2017,Coping with catastrophe: foraging plasticity enables a benthic predator to survive in rapidly degrading coral reefs,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) disproportionately affects species with specialist traits and long generation times. By circumventing prolonged evolutionary processes, behavioural plasticity is critical in allowing species to cope with rapid environmental changes within their lifetimes. Coral reefs have faced multiple mass mortality events of corals related to climate change in the last two decades. The consequent loss of structural complexity adversely impacts long-lived, structure-dependent fish predators. We attempted to determine how well a guild of groupers (Pisces: Epinephelidae) copes with rapid structural change in the lightly fished Lakshadweep Archipelago, Indian Ocean. Of the 15 species, territorial and site-attached groupers declined exponentially with decreasing structural complexity, while widely ranging species showed no change. However, one site-attached species, the peacock grouper, Cephalopholis argus, maintained high densities across the structural gradient. We explored the mechanisms this species employs to cope with declining habitat structure. Our observations indicate that both a potential release from specialist competitors and plasticity in foraging behaviour (foraging territory size, diet and foraging mode) appeared to favour the peacock grouper's survival in sites of high and low structure. While specialist competitors dropped out of the assemblage, the foraging territory size of peacock groupers increased exponentially with structural decline, but remained constant and compact (50 m(2)) above a threshold of structural complexity (corresponding to a canopy height of 60 cm). Interestingly, despite significant differences in prey density in sites of high and low structure, gut content and stable isotope analyses indicated that peacock groupers maintained a specialized dietary niche. In-water behavioural observations suggested that diet specialization was maintained by switching foraging modes from a structure-dependent 'ambush' to a structure-independent 'widely foraging' mode. The remarkable foraging plasticity of species such as the peacock grouper will become increasingly critical in separating winners from losers and may help preserve specialist ecosystem functions as habitats collapse as a result of climate change.

"Karlsson, P; Jonsson, T; Jonsson, A",2007,Food web structure and interaction strength pave the way for vulnerability to extinction,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"This paper focuses on how food web structure and interactions among species affects the vulnerability, due to environmental variability, to extinction of species at different positions in model food webs. Vulnerability is here not measured by a traditional extinction threshold but is instead inspired by the IUCN criteria for endangered species: an observed rapid decline in population abundance. Using model webs influenced by stochasticity with zero autocorrelation, we investigate the ecological determinants of species vulnerability, i.e. the trophic interactions between species and food web structure and how these interact with the risk of sudden drops in abundance of species. We find that (i) producers fulfil the criterion of vulnerable species more frequently than other species, (ii) food web structure is related to vulnerability, and (iii) the vulnerability of species is greater when involved in a strong trophic interaction than when not. We note that our result on the relationship between extinction risk and trophic position of species contradict previous suggestions and argue that the main reason for the discrepancy probably is due to the fact that we study the vulnerability to environmental stochasticity and not extinction risk due to overexploitation, habitat destruction or interactions with introduced species. Thus, we suggest that the vulnerability of species to environmental stochasticity may be differently related to trophic position than the vulnerability of species to other factors. Earlier research on species extinctions has looked for intrinsic traits of species that correlate with increased vulnerability to extinction. However, to fully understand the extinction process we must also consider that species interactions may affect vulnerability and that not all extinctions are the result of long, gradual reductions in species abundances. Under environmental stochasticity (which importance frequently is assumed to increase as a result of climate change) and direct and indirect interactions with other species some extinctions may occur rapidly and apparently unexpectedly. To identify the first declines of population abundances that may escalate and lead to extinctions as early as possible, we need to recognize which species are at greatest risk of entering such dangerous routes and under what circumstances. This new perspective may contribute to our understanding of the processes leading to extinction of populations and eventually species. This is especially urgent in the light of the current biodiversity crisis where a large fraction of the world's biodiversity is threatened. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, estimating diets has been done through classification and enumeration of prey remains found in stomach contents of seabirds collected at sea, as well as chick meals, pellets, and feces collected at breeding colonies. These techniques have the advantage of high taxonomic resolution of prey, but suffer from biases due to the underestimation of soft-bodied or small prey that are digested completely and overestimation of prey with durable parts that are retained for long periods of time. Recent innovations in 2 biochemical assays of seabird tissues-stable isotope and fatty acid analyses-have greatly expanded knowledge of seabird diets and have advanced our understanding of the ways in which seabirds can indicate inter-seasonal, annual, decadal, and longer shifts in oceanographic conditions over varying spatial scales. Advances in statistical approaches to these data have provided new ways in which prey can be identified and quantified. When applied in combination, these 3 techniques (traditional diet sampling, and stable isotope and fatty acid analyses) have the potential to reveal pathways of energy flux across marine ecosystems and to provide new insight into marine ecosystem dynamics. We review the basic principles of these approaches to determining seabird diet and emphasize the need for more formal conceptual and statistical integration of methods to advance this field.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Identifying species that benefit society represents a critical first step towards predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss. Though natural predators prevent billions of dollars in agricultural pest damage annually, characterizing which predators consume pests has proven challenging. Emerging molecular techniques may illuminate these interactions. In the countryside of Costa Rica, we identified avian predators of coffee's most damaging insect pest, the coffee berry borer beetle (Coleoptera:Scolytidae Hypothenemus hampeii), by assaying 1430 fecal samples of 108 bird species for borer DNA. While feeding trials confirmed the efficacy of our approach, detection rates were low. Nevertheless, we identified six species that consume the borer. These species had narrow diet breadths, thin bills, and short wings; traits shared with borer predators in other systems. Borer predators were not threatened; therefore, safeguarding pest control necessitates managing species beyond those at risk of regional extinction by maintaining populations in farmland habitats.

However, within-species chromosomal and reproductive variability have usually been neglected in community ecology and biodiversity analyses even though they have been recognized to play a role in the adaptive diversification of lineages. Methods We used Paspalum intermedium, a grass species with diverging genetic systems (diploidy vs. autopolyploidy, allogamy vs. autogamy and sexuality vs. apomixis), to recognize the causality of biogeographic patterns, adaptation and ecological flexibility of cytotypes. Chromosome counts and flow cytometry were used to characterize within-species genetic systems diversity. Environmental niche modelling was used to evaluate intraspecific ecological attributes associated with environmental and climatic factors and to assess correlations among ploidy, reproductive modes and ecological conditions ruling species' population dynamics, range expansion, adaptation and evolutionary history. Key Results Two dominant cytotypes non-randomly distributed along local and regional geographical scales displayed niche differentiation, a directional shift in niche optima and signs of disruptive selection on ploidy-related ecological aptitudes for the exploitation of environmental resources. Ecologically specialized allogamous sexual diploids were found in northern areas associated with higher temperature, humidity and productivity, while generalist autogamous apomictic tetraploids occurred in southern areas, occupying colder and less productive environments. Four localities with a documented shift in ploidy and four mixed populations in a zone of ecological transition revealed an uneven replacement between cytotypes. Conclusions Polyploidy and contrasting reproductive traits between cytotypes have promoted shifts in niche optima, and increased ecological tolerance and niche divergence. Ecologically specialized diploids maintain cytotype stability in core areas by displacing tetraploids, while broader ecological preferences and a shift from sexuality to apomixis favoured polyploid colonization in peripheral areas where diploids are displaced, and fostered the ecological opportunity for autotetraploids supporting range expansion to open southern habitats.",10.1093/aob/mcy004,Y,0,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = ploidy, reproductive mode, ",
"Kaser, JM; Heimpel, GE",2015,Linking risk and efficacy in biological control host-parasitoid models,BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,"Exotic invasive arthropods present an increasing threat to native species, ecosystem function, crop production, forests, and other natural resources. Importation ('classical') biological control can be a cost-effective tactic for long-term pest management that reduces insecticide use. However, while importation of biological control agents has great potential benefits, it also entails risks to non-target native species. Therefore, candidate biological control agents are studied prior to release to predict safety. Little is known, however, about how traits affecting the safety of biological control agents may impact their efficacy in terms of reducing pest populations. We use a difference equation model to simulate a one-parasitoid two-host system and evaluate conditions under which biological control safety and efficacy interact. We vary the search efficiency and resistance to parasitism of both host species and interpret the results from the standpoint that one host is a target pest and the other a non-target species. We find that apparent competition can have important benefits for increasing biological control efficacy, even at low levels of non-target impact. However, under conditions of parasitoid egg limitation, high attack rates on resistant non-target hosts can dramatically decrease biological control efficacy while concurrently increasing non-target risk. These findings are discussed in the context of biological control agent pre-release risk benefit assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation - but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values.

The current development of large databases has led to a new screening approach that relies on the extraction of trait values from databases, rather than on measurement of traits in the field. We tested this assumption with the following questions: (1) is the magnitude of intra-specific variability of co-occurring species lower than inter-specific variability for a given trait, in comparisons at different spatial scales; (2) is species hierarchy based on trait values conserved across different spatial scales and data sets (stable species hierarchy hypothesis); and (3) when we compare different traits, what is the more stable trait that is conserved across different spatial scales and data sets? MethodsWe combined approaches commonly used in functional ecology, i.e. experimental data, field observations and extraction of data from a global database, and analysed the magnitude of intra-specific and inter-specific trait variations for a large number of traits across contrasting environmental conditions for 18-39 (mostly) herbaceous species, according to the data set used. ResultsFor most traits, inter-specific variability was higher than intra-specific variability, and species ranking was conserved across different data sets and spatial scales. However, we also detected important differential responses in terms of intra-specific trait variability, depending on the trait examined: SLA, LDMC, SM, seed N concentration and onset of flowering were more stable, whereas leaf chemical traits and RH were more flexible traits. ConclusionsOur study validated, for the species studied, the stable species hierarchy hypothesis in the case of several, but not all, widely used traits. The main conclusion is that the strength of the species signal is strong enough for some traits to allow values to be used from different data sets (experiments, databases) to characterize local populations of species: for SM, seed N concentration, RH, SLA and LDMC.",10.1111/jvs.12066,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = veg plant height, repro plant height, mean area of a leaf, SLA, LDMC, leaf N content, leaf P content, leaf C content, C isotope ratio, seed mass, seed N concentration, onset of flowering",

Range-shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction, often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data, but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species, the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia, assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move, survive, and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally, by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism, trait-based approaches can be used to investigate the range-limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species' potential to evolve at range-edges.

"Kearney, Michael R.; Matzelle, Allison; Helmuth, Brian",2012,Biomechanics meets the ecological niche: the importance of temporal data resolution,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"The emerging field of mechanistic niche modelling aims to link the functional traits of organisms to their environments to predict survival, reproduction, distribution and abundance. This approach has great potential to increase our understanding of the impacts of environmental change on individuals, populations and communities by providing functional connections between physiological and ecological response to increasingly available spatial environmental data. By their nature, such mechanistic models are more data intensive in comparison with the more widely applied correlative approaches but can potentially provide more spatially and temporally explicit predictions, which are often needed by decision makers. A poorly explored issue in this context is the appropriate level of temporal resolution of input data required for these models, and specifically the error in predictions that can be incurred through the use of temporally averaged data. Here, we review how biomechanical principles from heat-transfer and metabolic theory are currently being used as foundations for mechanistic niche models and consider the consequences of different temporal resolutions of environmental data for modelling the niche of a behaviourally thermoregulating terrestrial lizard. We show that fine-scale temporal resolution (daily) data can be crucial for unbiased inference of climatic impacts on survival, growth and reproduction. This is especially so for species with little capacity for behavioural buffering, because of behavioural or habitat constraints, and for detecting temporal trends.

The North American freshwater fish fauna is both diverse and increasingly imperiled through human mediated disturbances, including climate change. The Tennessee River, USA, contains one of the most diverse assemblages of freshwater fish in North America and has more imperiled species than other rivers, but there has been no trait-based study of community structure in the system. We identified 211 localities in the upper Tennessee River that were sampled by the Tennessee Valley Authority between 2009 and 2011 and compiled fish functional traits for the observed species and environmental variables for each locality. Using fourth corner analysis, we identified significant correlations between many fish functional traits and environmental variables. Functional traits associated with an opportunistic life history strategy were correlated with localities subject to greater land use disturbance and less flow regulation, while functional traits associated with a periodic life history strategy were correlated with localities subject to regular disturbance and regulated flow. These are patterns observed at the continental scale, highlighting the generalizability of trait-based methods. Contrary to studies that found no community structure differences when considering riparian buffer zones, we found that fish functional traits were correlated with different environmental variables between analyses with buffer zones vs. entire catchment area land cover proportions. Using existing databases and fourth corner analysis, our results support the broad application potential for trait-based methods and indicate trait-based methods can detect environmental filtering by riparian zone land cover.",10.1371/journal.pone.0093237,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"traits = foraging method, max length, age at maturation, longevity, fecundity, spawning mechanism, spawning time, non-feeding water column position, native or non-native",

Using a metacommunity simulation incorporating quantitative models of trait evolution and community assembly, I assessed the performance of different tests that have been used to measure community phylogenetic structure. All tests were sensitive to the relative phylogenetic signal in species metacommunity abundances and traits; methods that were most sensitive to the effects of niche-based processes on community structure were also more likely to find non-random patterns of community phylogenetic structure under dispersal assembly. When used with a null model that maintained species occurrence frequency in random communities, several metrics could detect niche-based assembly when there was strong phylogenetic signal in species traits, when multiple traits were involved in community assembly, and in the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Interpretations of the causes of community phylogenetic structure should be modified to account for the influence of dispersal.",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01354.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Kemp, Darrell J.; Reznick, David N.; Grether, Gregory F.",2008,Ornamental evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata): insights from sensory processing-based analyses of entire colour patterns,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,"The evolution of exaggerated sexual ornamentation is classically thought to proceed as a compromise between opposing vectors of sexual and natural selection. In colour-based ornamentation, as exhibited by guppies (Poecilia reticulata), heightened trait expression may be beneficial in promoting attractiveness, but costly in terms of predation. Opportunities to reconcile this compromise will exist if there are differences between conspecifics and predators in their sensory systems; in such situations guppies should evolve to exploit the ways in which their ornamentation would appear maximally conspicuous to conspecifics. In the present study, we addressed this hypothesis via a study of geographic variation employing the most sophisticated colour analysis yet attempted for Trinidadian guppies. We made two paired contrasts, one between two Aripo populations that vary in the presence of the potential predator Aequidens pulcher, and another between Quare and Marianne populations that vary in exposure to a predatory prawn, Macrobrachium crenulatum. We predicted that, if ornamentation is constrained by the presence of either predator, then guppy conspicuousness should change most markedly across each of the two paired populations as viewed by that predator. Although disparity analysis of entire colour patterns indicated significant differences in both contrasts, this prediction was most clearly supported for the Marianne/Quare contrast. Marianne fish, which co-exist with prawns, exhibited larger black spots coupled with less extensive, less bright flank iridescence. The brightness reductions are notable because, as the only potential guppy predator with a dedicated ultraviolet (UV) photoreceptor, prawns may detect passing male guppies via their UV-bright blues, violets and 'UV/oranges'. We discuss our findings in light of the additional insights that might be obtained by combining spectral assessments and visual modeling with more traditional methods of colour pattern appraisal.

These data have been used to test predictions of life history theory as well as to guide decisions of wildlife managers and conservation biologists. Life history theory predicts tradeoffs among life history traits, such that current reproductive effort will be negatively correlated with survival and/or future reproduction. Many studies support this prediction, but others report positive covariation between fitness traits, and attribute positive correlations to differences in individual quality. In this study, we used 11 yr of capture-mark-recapture data of breeding female Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa), along with their breeding histories, to examine sources of variation in annual survival rates and to assess the impact of current reproductive success on probabilities of survival and future reproductive success. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models indicated that apparent survival of female Wood Ducks did not vary annually and was only weakly affected by age class and breeding habitat conditions, but that there was a strong positive relationship between survival and the number of successful nests (0, 1, or 2). Next, we used a multistate analysis to examine the importance of female nest fate (successful or failed) on the probability of surviving and of nesting successfully the next year. Early incubation body mass was used to assess the nutritional status and quality of females. Females that nested successfully in year t were not less likely to nest successfully in year t + 1 than females that had nested unsuccessfully in year t. We also found strong positive covariation between nest success in year t and the probability of surviving. However, being in relatively good or poor condition had no effect on these relationships. Our results are consistent with the idea that female quality is heterogeneous, but body mass was not a good proxy of quality. Therefore, the existence of tradeoffs between female reproductive success and survival or future reproduction was less clear because of our inability to identify and control for differences in female quality.",10.1642/AUK-15-183.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Therefore, understanding variation in plant anti-herbivore defence traits requires studying their expression along steep environmental gradients, such as along elevation, where multiple biotic and abiotic factors co-vary. We expand on plant defence theory and propose a novel conceptual framework to address the sources of variations of plant resistance traits at the community level. We analysed elevation patterns of within-community trait dissimilarity using the RaoQ index, and the community-weighted-mean (CWM) index, on several plant functional traits: plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf-dry-matter-content (LDMC), silicium content, presence of trichomes, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (CN) and total secondary metabolite richness. We found that at high elevation, where harsh environmental conditions persist, community functional convergence is dictated by traits relating to plant growth (plant height and SLA), while divergence arises for traits relating resource-use (LDMC). At low elevation, where greater biotic pressure occurs, we found a combination of random (plant height), convergence (metabolite richness) and divergence patterns (silicium content). This framework thus combines community assembly rules of ecological filtering and niche partition with plant defence hypotheses to unravel the relationship between environmental variations, biotic pressure and the average phenotype of plants within a community.",10.1007/s00442-018-4162-y,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf-dry-matter-content (LDMC), silicium content, presence of trichomes, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (CN) and total secondary metabolite richness",

In this study, we identified six major plankton groups in Lake Bourget (France), based on cell size, taxonomic properties, food-web interactions and occurrence patterns: cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, small and large phytoplankton, mixotrophs, herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton. We then developed a deterministic dynamic model that describes the dynamics of these groups in terms of carbon and phosphorus fluxes, as well as of particulate organic phosphorus and dissolved inorganic phosphorus. The modular and generic model scheme, implemented as a set of modules under Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) enables run-time coupling of the plankton module an arbitrary number of times, each time with a prescribed position across the autotrophy/heterotrophy continuum. Parameters of the plankton groups were mainly determined conjointly by the taxonomic and allometric relationships, based on the species composition and average cellular volume of each group. The biogeochemical model was coupled to the one-dimensional General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) and forced with local meteorological conditions. The coupled model system shows very high skill in predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of water temperature and dissolved inorganic phosphorus for five simulated years within the period 2004 to 2010, and intermediate skill in predicting the plankton succession. We performed a scenario analysis to gain insight into the factors driving the sudden disappearance of P. rubescens in 2010. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that the abundance of this species before the onset of stratification is critical for its success later in the growing season, pointing thereby to a priority effect.

E.",2018,Functional diversity is more sensitive to biotic filters than phylogenetic diversity during community assembly.,Ecosphere,"Ecologically important functional traits and phylogenetic relatedness may provide mechanistic insight into biotic filters influencing community assembly. To assess this, we examined the relationship between functional diversity (FD, functional trait relatedness) and phylogenetic diversity (PD, evolutionary relatedness) during grassland restoration. Temporal changes in FD and PD were used to examine the effect of two biotic filters during community assembly: intraspecific variation in dominant species (different population sources) and interspecific variation among subordinate species (phylogenetically distinct species pools). The experimental grassland restoration contained whole plots sown with either cultivars or local ecotypes of three dominant grasses (Sorghastrum nutans, Andropogon gerardii, and Schizachyrium scoparium). Each whole plot contained subplots sown with three phylogenetically distinct pools of subordinate species. Cover of all species was measured in permanent sampling areas for ten years, and 10 functional traits were measured for 88 species, allowing calculation of PD and FD, respectively. Overall, the communities establishing with local ecotypes of the dominant grasses were functionally more dissimilar than when established with cultivars, particularly among the Asteraceae, suggesting competitive exclusion of functionally dissimilar species by cultivars. This result was opposite to our prediction that cultivars through limiting similarity would exclude more similar species more so than would local ecotypes. The effect of the dominant grass population source was contingent upon interactions with species pools. A supplemental propagule addition of functionally dissimilar species four years since initial sowing increased FD, but this effect varied among species pools. A lack of relationship between FD and PD in this system indicated that measuring PD alone without inclusion of functional traits may miss additional factors affecting species coexistence. In addition, the variation in FD between population sources and among species pools indicated that the measured traits were more sensitive to these factors than to their phylogenetic relationships. This analysis of long-term data from a field experiment showed new consequences of using different seed sources and species pools (as biotic filters), and supplemental seeding on PD and FD of restored grassland.

While such prevalent data gaps can engender misleading inferences in FD analyses, we currently lack any practical guide to handle missing data in trait datasets. Here, we identify significant mismatches between true FD and values derived from datasets that contain missing data. We demonstrate that imputing missing data with a phylogeny-informed approach reduces the risk of misinterpretation of FD patterns, and provides baseline information against which central questions in ecology can be evaluated.",10.1111/ele.13089,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

To address this challenge, I searched current and historical literature to develop a database of 13 life history traits and 8 descriptive variables for 87 normative insect biological control species in the continental United States. Models for predicting success in controlling a target species and likelihood of nontarget effects (documented cases of attacks on native hosts, prey, or natural enemies) were developed using logistic regression. The most important life history traits for predicting success included host specificity, whether the agent was a predator or parasitoid, and number of generations per year. There was no information about nontarget effects in 50 of 87 cases. Traits important for predicting nontarget effects included sex ratio of progeny and the documented presence of native natural enemies.

The relative importance of specialized and generalized plant-pollinator relationships is contentious, yet analyses usually avoid direct measures of pollinator quality (effectiveness), citing difficulties in collecting such data in the field and so relying on visitation data alone.2. We demonstrate that single-visit deposition (SVD) of pollen on virgin stigmas is a practical measure of pollinator effectiveness, using 13 temperate and tropical plant species. For each flower the most effective pollinator measured from SVD was as predicted from its pollination syndrome based on traditional advertisement and reward traits. Overall, c.40% of visitors were not effective pollinators (range 0-78% for different flowers); thus, flower-pollinator relationships are substantially more specialized than visitation alone can reveal.3. Analyses at species level are crucial, as significant variation in SVD occurred within both higher-level taxonomic groups (genus, family) and within functional groups.4. Other measures sometimes used to distinguish visitors from pollinators (visit duration, frequency, or feeding behaviour in flowers) did not prove to be suitable proxies.5. Distinguishing between 'pollinators' and 'visitors' is therefore crucial, and true 'pollination networks' should include SVD to reveal pollinator effectiveness (PE). Generating such networks, now underway, could avoid potential misinterpretations of the conservation values of flower visitors, and of possible extinction threats as modelled in existing networks.",10.1111/2041-210X.12074,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, how local species interactions scale-up to large spatial scales and how they contribute to shape species distributions and diversity patterns at macroecological extents remains less clear. Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure. Addressing these key topics and achieving a better integration between these two research fields will significantly advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multispecies interactions.

"Klaschka, U",2008,The infochemical effect - a new chapter in ecotoxicology,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Background, aim, and scope Organisms use chemical cues in their surrounding, so-called infochemicals, as important source of information about their biotic and abiotic environment. The scope of this work is to transfer the knowledge on infochemicals obtained in chemical ecology into ecotoxicology, compare the observations with ecotoxicological standard tests, with other sublethal effects, and deduce consequences for the legal situation of environmental chemicals. Main features General principles were elaborated from the compiled information from literature on the structures and roles of natural infochemicals. The experiences gained in chemical ecology and in ecotoxicology led to the discovery of the infochemical effect: Anthropogenic substances can influence the chemical communication of environmental organisms. This finding is supported by a close look at fragrances and other common anthropogenic substances in the environment. Results Increasing scientific knowledge shows how complex the chemical communication of environmental organisms is. Infochemicals are released by senders and detected by receivers. The relevant concentrations of infochemicals are very low, usually in the nano- to micromolar range and they do not seem to have common structural features. Knowledge about natural infochemicals is still poor and not consistent. The chemical cues fluctuate specifically in time and space resulting in dynamic response patterns in the ecosystem. Organisms can react to infochemicals in very specific ways by behavioral, morphological, or physiological responses; activities that are relevant for their survival as vital reactions such as flight, food uptake, or mating are affected. Anthropogenic substances at minor concentrations can interfere in the complex chemical communication web of infochemicals, possibly leading to increased vulnerability of populations. Discussion The findings show clearly that the actual description of the interplay of organisms in the ecosystem is still very simplified and we are far from understanding the interactions completely. Anthropogenic discharges may play a role on the chemical communication and, hence, on the behavior and interactions of organisms in the ecosystem. The description of the infochemical effect opens a new chapter in ecotoxicology. It is a challenge to develop a suitable test system for the infochemical effect with the knowledge of the multitude of possible reactions and of the high specificity of infochemicals. Problems during the performance and evaluation of standard tests might be related to reactions due to infochemicals in the test systems which have not been considered so far. Conclusions The roles of anthropogenic infochemicals in the environment and the role of natural infochemicals in laboratory tests have been underestimated up to now. Recommendations The discrepancy between the biological relevance and the lack of data about infochemicals in the environment reveals the necessity of further research. According to the actual findings, infochemicals are so decisive for the interactions in the ecosystem that they should not be neglected in ecotoxicology. The discovery of the infochemical effect is comparable to the detection that environmental substances can act as hormones. Sublethal effects with impacts on the ecosystem, such as the infochemical effect, will receive higher appraisal in the ecotoxicology of the future. It needs to be clarified to which extent anthropogenic discharges disturb the natural chemical communication web. A systematic analysis of this very complex field will be needed to know whether a new ecotoxicological endpoint, the infochemical effect, will have to be taken up in the standard repertoire. The knowledge on infochemicals might require some adjustments of the legal framework on environmental chemicals in future. Looking closer at the infochemical effect will lead to a new understanding of the complexity of environmental communities.",10.1007/s11356-008-0019-y,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Kleyer, M; Minden, V",2015,Why functional ecology should consider all plant organs: An allocation-based perspective,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Functional ecology often analyses a few selected traits and relates them either to environmental conditions or ecosystem properties. However, not the individual trait, but the whole plant with a set of coordinated traits responds to the environment or affects ecosystem properties. Here we argue that the correlation among traits of all major plant organs should be an integral part of response or effect studies. Plants allocate elements and biomass among roots, perennial clonal organs, stems, leaves and seeds to ensure growth and reproduction. Assessment of trait responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems is hardly possible without simultaneously considering all plant organs and the biological functions they perform, namely resource uptake, vegetative regeneration, support and hydraulic pathways, photosynthesis and generative reproduction. Suitable traits to indicate these functions include those of mass, density, size, volume, and element contents of the main plant organs. In principle, we do not propose to collect many traits, but those of similar significance across organs. For instance, specific leaf area should be complemented by specific root length and specific stem length. We present some thoughts on how coordinated allocation to biological functions sets boundaries to the range of trait expressions in successional series and consequently also to species responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems. Considering the coordination of traits amongst all major plant organs will improve our understanding of plant strategies ensuring survival in patterned landscapes.",10.1016/j.baae.2014.11.002,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Location Braulio Carrillo National Park and Cerro de la Muerte, Costa Rica, Central America. Methods We used an empirical dataset of the quantitative pattern of species occurrences and individual numbers of ferns within 156 plots along a tropical elevational gradient to test whether directed ecological sorting might cause deviations in patterns of trait and phylogenetic diversity. Mean pairwise distances of species based on phylogenetic and trait properties were compared with two different sets of null assemblages, one maintaining species frequency distributions (constrained) and one not (unconstrained). Results Applying different null models resulted in varying degrees of overdispersion and clustering, but overall patterns of deviation from random expectations remained the same. Contrary to theoretical predictions, phylogenetic and trait diversity were relatively independent from one another. Phylogenetic diversity showed no patterns along the elevational gradient, whereas trait diversity showed significant trends for epiphytes. Main conclusions Under stressful environmental conditions (drought at low elevations and frost at high elevations), epiphytic fern assemblages tended to be clustered with respect to trait characteristics, which suggests environmental filtering. Conversely, under less extreme environmental conditions (middle of the transect), the sorting was biased towards high differentiation (overdispersion), presumably because of interspecific competition and trait shifts among closely related species (character displacement).",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02433.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = rhizome type, laminar dissection, laminar morphology, laminar thickness, scale and hair density, hydathodes, indusium, buds",

Net ecosystem productivity and ecosystem C balance were positively correlated at low disturbance with plant species richness. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and soil C sequestration were, however, unrelated to these variables. Community aggregated leaf (specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content) and root and rhizome (specific length, tissue density, diameter) traits responded (R) significantly to changes in disturbance, indicating an increased dominance of conservative plant growth strategies at low compared with high disturbance. Applying the mathematical framework, ANPP was predicted by distribution of leaf traits within the community (functional divergence), while mean root and rhizome traits had significant effects (E) on soil C sequestration, irrespective of the experimental disturbance and of the year. According to highly significant linear regression models, between 6% and 61% of the transient changes in soil C sequestration resulted from community root and rhizome (response-and-effect) traits after a change in disturbance.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01905.x,Y,0,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,1,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = vegetative height, leaf mass ratio, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry‐matter content (LDMC), root ( specific length (SL, m g−1 DM), tissue density (DENS, g DM cm−3), diameter (D, mm) and nitrogen content (NC, g N g−1 DM) )",

Ceratopsian dinosaurs are known for their exaggerated and often elaborate horns and frills, which vary considerably between species. Many explanations have been proposed for the origin and evolution of these 'ornamental' traits, from predator defence to socio-sexual dominance signalling and, more recently, species recognition. A key prediction of the species recognition hypothesis is that two or more species possessing divergent ornamental traits should have been at least partially sympatric. For the first time to our knowledge, we test this hypothesis in ceratopsians by conducting a comparison of the morphological characters of 46 species. A total of 350 ceratopsian cladistic characters were categorized as either 'internal', 'display' (i.e. ornamental) or 'non display'. Patterns of diversity of these characters were evaluated across 1035 unique species pairs. Display characters were found to diverge rapidly overall, but sympatric species were not found to differ significantly in their ornamental disparity from non-sympatric species, regardless of phylogenetic distance. The prediction of the species recognition hypothesis, and thus the idea that ornamentation evolved as a species recognition mechanism, has no statistical support among known ceratopsians.",10.1098/rspb.2018.0312,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Various studies on insects use disparate methods to assess ""body condition."" However, it is doubtful that the results obtained by disparate methods are comparable. In this study, the body conditions of Poecilus cupreus (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Carabidae) from eight sites were compared based on the following commonly used variables: (i) fresh weight, (ii) dry weight, and (iii) fat content. All of these variables were corrected for structural body size. Moreover, the effects of using the following ways of assessing structural body size were examined: (a) one size measurement (length of elytron, which is commonly used in beetles), and (b) three size measurements (length of elytron, width of pronotum and length of hind femur). The results obtained using the various estimations of body condition (i, ii, iii) varied significantly. Therefore, studies employing distinct body measurements to assess body condition are not comparable to each other. Using multiple structural size measurements in body condition analyses is better than the common practice of using only one size measurement. However, in the present study, results provided by both methods differ only slightly.

It is widely believed that forest composition in the eastern U.S. is transitioning from shade-intolerant, fire-tolerant species to shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant species, but most evidence is anecdotal or localized. No comprehensive studies exist to quantify the shifts in forest composition across multiple genera at a regional scale. Here, we examined the genus-level compositional changes in eastern U.S. forests to: (1) quantify the extent and magnitude of this transition, and (2) assess the influence of shade and fire tolerance traits on abundance change. Genus-level data were compiled from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database across 37 states in the eastern U.S. for the last three decades. We analyzed shifts in forest composition with three metrics-stem density, basal area, and importance value-for 10 of the most abundant genera (Acer, Betula, Carya, Fraxinus, Nyssa, Pinus, Populus, Prunus, Quercus, and Illmus). In addition, we estimated density-weighted fire and shade tolerances for each genus using species-level published data, assessed the shifts in spatial patterns of these traits, and analyzed the associations between these traits and county-level abundance changes. In general, Acer, Fraxinus, Pinus, and Prunus increased in abundance during the study period. Acer experienced the largest increase in abundance across the study area. In contrast, Carya, Nyssa, Quercus and Ulmus decreased in abundance in the majority of the study region, with Quercus having the largest and most extensive decline. Although density-weighted shade and fire tolerances were correlated at the genus level, shade tolerance was a better predictor of genus-level abundance change than fire tolerance. Traits of fire and shade tolerance are not always interchangeable when used to predict the dynamics of a genus, and management decision making based on traits should focus at the species level when possible. Our analyses provide evidence that forest composition has shifted in the last three decades in the eastern United States across multiple genera, and the shifts are more closely related to species' shade tolerance than fire tolerance.",10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.061,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,1,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,1,"traits = shade tolerance, fire tolerance",
"Ko, CY; Schmitz, OJ; Jetz, W",2016,The limits of direct community modeling approaches for broad-scale predictions of ecological assemblage structure,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Two distinct modeling approaches are often used When predicting biodiversity patterns: stacking of species models (predict first, assemble later), and directly modeling a characteristic of a community such as species richness (assemble first, predict later). The relative utility of these two approaches for biogeographic, macroecological and global change analyses is uncertain. Here we compared the two approaches by predicting current-day avian dietary guild structure of assemblages worldwide. We found that the stacked-species modeling approach consistently predicted the geographic distribution of observed dietary guilds better than a direct community modeling approach. The exception was for plant-eating birds, especially frugivores, which are expected to have particularly strong climatic constraints on their diversity and distributions. Assemblage-level biodiversity patterns predicted by community-based modeling approaches, such as the stacked-species and direct community modeling approaches in this study, offer a means to help guide conservation decisions for determining environmental suitability and analyzing diversity hotspots. However, our results generally caution against the widespread use of direct community modeling approach at the large spatial extents for predicting species assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While experimental and observational results can inform about anticipated effects of different drivers, linking between these results and ecosystem-level changes requires quantitative integration of physiological and ecological processes into models to advance research and inform management. We give an overview of important physiological and ecological processes affected by environmental drivers. We then provide a review of available modelling approaches for marine fish, analysing their capacities for process-based integration of environmental drivers. Building on this, we propose approaches to advance important research questions. Examples of integration of environmental drivers exist for each model class. Recent extensions of modelling frameworks increase the potential for including detailed mechanisms and improving model projections. Experimental results on energy allocation, behaviour and physiological limitations will advance the understanding of organism-level trade-offs and thresholds in response to multiple drivers. More explicit representation of life cycles and biological traits can improve description of population dynamics and adaptation, and data on food web topology and feeding interactions help to detail the conditions for possible regime shifts. Identification of relevant processes will also benefit the coupling of different models to investigate spatial-temporal changes in stock productivity and integrated responses of social-ecological systems.

This challenge is especially apparent when sampling units are spread across a heterogeneous landscape or along an environmental gradient because multiple mechanisms can produce similar co-occurrence patterns. We developed a trait-based approach for discriminating between environmental filtering and biotic interactions as the probable driver of co-occurrence patterns across environmentally heterogeneous sites. We demonstrate our framework by analyzing the co-occurrence of small mammals over elevation in three independent mountain ranges in the Great Basin of the western United States. Our sampling design accounts for landscape scale environmental variability and within-site habitat heterogeneity. We identified 52 non-random species pairs, of which 36 were aggregated and 16 were segregated. For each pair, we determined which mechanism was the likely ecological explanation using a hypothesis-testing framework based on functional trait similarity. Expectations of biotic interactions were based on similarity of diet and body size whereas habitat affinity and geographic range were used for environmental filtering. Only four pairs were consistent with expectations under biotic interactions, including pairs for which competitive exclusion has previously been documented. In addition to analyzing individual pairs, we used binomial tests of observed versus expected totals of intra- and inter-guild pairs to determine assemblage-wide deviations from random community structure. Signatures of environmental filtering were consistent across mountain ranges and scales. Despite differences in species composition and significant pairs among data sets, our approach revealed consistent mechanistic conclusions, emphasizing the value of trait-based methods to co-occurrence and community assembly.",10.1111/ecog.03747,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Mammals,Alpine,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = diet guild and body size class, habitat affinity, geogrpahic affinity",

Whether these shifts elicit a phenotypic response, and how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to phenotypic change, are key issues for understanding biological invasions and how populations may respond to local climate change. We combined modeling, field data, and a laboratory experiment to test for changing thermal tolerances during the introduction of the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus from Puerto Rico to Miami, Florida. Species distribution models and bioclimatic data analyses showed lower minimum temperatures, and greater seasonal and annual variation in temperature for Miami compared to Puerto Rico. Two separate introductions of A. cristatellus occurred in Miami about 12 km apart, one in South Miami and the other on Key Biscayne, an offshore island. As predicted from the shift in the thermal climate and the thermal tolerances of other Anolis species in Miami, laboratory acclimation and field acclimatization showed that the introduced South Miami population of A. cristatellus has diverged from its native-range source population by acquiring low-temperature acclimation ability. By contrast, the introduced Key Biscayne population showed little change compared to its source. Our analyses predicted an adaptive response for introduced populations, but our comparisons to native-range sources provided evidence for thermal plasticity in one introduced population but not the other. The rapid acquisition of thermal plasticity by A. cristatellus in South Miami may be advantageous for its long-term persistence there and expansion of its non-native range.

To test this prediction, we used a laboratory model of vertebrate adaptive radiation to investigate the genetic basis of the response to selection for predatory behavior and compare it with evolution of aerobic capacity reported in an earlier work. After 13 generations of selection, the proportion of bank voles (Myodes [=Clethrionomys] glareolus) showing predatory behavior was five times higher in selected lines than in controls. We analyzed the hippocampus and liver transcriptomes and found repeatable changes in allele frequencies and gene expression. Genes with the largest differences between predatory and control lines are associated with hunger, aggression, biological rhythms, and functioning of the nervous system. Evolution of predatory behavior could be meaningfully compared with evolution of high aerobic capacity, because the experiments and analyses were performed in the same methodological framework. The number of genes that changed expression was much smaller in predatory lines, and allele frequencies changed repeatably in predatory but not in aerobic lines. This suggests thatmore variants of smaller effects underlie variation in aerobic performance, whereas fewer variants of larger effects underlie variation in predatory behavior. Our results thus contradict the view that comparable selection pressures for different quantitative traits produce similar molecular patterns. Therefore, to gain knowledge about molecular-level response to selection for complex traits, we need to investigate not only multiple replicate populations but also multiple quantitative traits.",10.1093/molbev/msw121,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Kooi, BW; Troost, TA",2006,Advantage of storage in a fluctuating environment,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,"We will elaborate the evolutionary course of an ecosystem consisting of a population in a chemostat environment with periodically fluctuating nutrient supply. The organisms that make up the population consist of structural biomass and energy storage compartments. In a constant chemostat environment a species without energy storage always out-competes a species with energy reserves. This hinders evolution of species with storage from those without storage. Using the adaptive dynamics approach for non-equilibrium ecological systems we will show that in a fluctuating environment there are multiple stable evolutionary singular strategies (ss's): one for a species without, and one for a species with energy storage. The evolutionary end-point depends on the initial evolutionary state. We will formulate the invasion fitness in terms of Floquet multipliers for the oscillating non-autonomous system. Bifurcation theory is used to study points where due to evolutionary development by mutational steps, the long-term dynamics of the ecological system changes qualitatively. To that end, at the ecological time scale, the trait value at which invasion of a mutant into a resident population becomes possible can be calculated using numerical bifurcation analysis where the trait is used as the free parameter, because it is just a bifurcation point. In a constant environment there is a unique stable equilibrium for one species following the ""competitive exclusion"" principle. In contrast, due to the oscillatory dynamics on the ecological time scale two species may coexist. That is, non-equilibrium dynamics enhances biodiversity. However, we will show that this coexistence is not stable on the evolutionary time scale and always one single species survives. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Location Australia. Methods We used 596 assemblage-level samples and 1137 woody species in rain forest vegetation sampled across two latitude regions (tropics and sub-tropics) and five distinct areas. Based on this dataset, we obtained and analysed species-level trait values (for leaf size, seed size, wood density and maximum height at maturity), measures of community phylogenetic structure and species turnover across space (beta) and evolutionary time (phylobeta). Results Phylobeta values showed that at continental scales (i.e. across the latitude regions combined) species replacement, as turnover in assemblages through time, was by more phylogenetically distant (i.e. less closely related) taxa. Within latitude regions replacement was by more closely related taxa. Assemblages of species were more phylogenetically clustered across the whole phylogeny (net relatedness index) and with respect to more recent divergences (nearest related taxon index) where the effects of historic disturbance (climatic oscillations) had been greater, and less clustered in long-term stable (refugial) locations. Local species composition in the stable wet tropics showed significant phylogenetic evenness, but there was no corresponding evenness in distributions of the ecological traits measured. Main conclusions Despite a shared evolutionary and biogeographic history, the two regions diverged from each other before the development of internal divergences.

Here we apply both methods to the Yasuni Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25-ha Amazonian forest with >1100 tree species. We found evidence for habitat filtering from both trait and phylogenetic methods from small (25 m(2)) to intermediate (10 000 m(2)) spatial scales. Trait- based methods detected even spacing of strategies, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning or enemy-mediated density dependence, at smaller spatial scales (25-400 m(2)). Simulation modeling of community assembly processes suggests that low statistical power to detect even spacing of traits at larger spatial scales may contribute to the observed patterns. Trait and phylogenetic methods tended to identify the same areas of the forest as being subject to habitat filtering. Phylogenetic community tests, which are far less data-intensive than trait-based methods, captured much of the same. ltering patterns detected by trait-based methods but often failed to detect even-spacing patterns apparent in trait data.

The co-occurrence of highly similar species may be unlikely if their similar needs lead to intense competition (limiting similarity). On the other hand, persistence in a particular habitat may require certain traits, such that communities end up consisting of species sharing the same traits (environmental filtering). Relatively little information exists on the relative importance of these processes in structuring parasite communities. Assuming that phylogenetic relatedness reflects ecological similarity, we tested whether the co-occurrence of pairs of flea species (Siphonaptera) on the same host individuals was explained by the phylogenetic distance between them, among 40 different samples of mammalian hosts (rodents and shrews) from different species, areas or seasons. Our results indicate that frequency of co-occurrence between flea species increased with decreasing phylogenetic distance between them in 37 out of 40 community samples, with 14 of these correlations being statistically significant. A meta-analysis across all samples confirmed the overall trend for closely related species to co-occur more frequently on the same individual hosts than expected by chance, independently of the identity of the host species or of environmental conditions. These findings suggest that competition between closely related, and therefore presumably ecologically similar, species is not important in shaping flea communities. Instead, if only fleas with certain behavioural, ecological and physiological properties can encounter and exploit a given host, and if phylogenetic relationships determine trait similarity among flea species, then a process akin to environmental filtering, or host filtering, could favour the co-occurrence of related species on the same host.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00646.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, the impact of trait change arising from plastic responses has received less attention, and is often assumed to optimize performance and unfold on a separate, faster timescale than ecological dynamics. Challenging these assumptions, we propose that gradual plasticity is important for ecological dynamics, and present a study of the plastic responses of the freshwater green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as it acclimates to temperature changes. First, we show that C. reinhardtii's gradual acclimation responses can both enhance and suppress its performance after a perturbation, depending on its prior thermal history. Second, we demonstrate that where conventional approaches fail to predict the population dynamics of C. reinhardtii exposed to temperature fluctuations, a new model of gradual acclimation succeeds. Finally, using high-resolution data, we show that phytoplankton in lake ecosystems can experience thermal variation sufficient to make acclimation relevant.

We also compare maximum parsimony versus maximum likelihood estimates of community phylogenetic relationships as well as evaluate the effectiveness of one-versus two-versus three-gene barcodes in resolving community evolutionary history. Conclusions/Significance: As first demonstrated in the Panamanian forest dynamics plot, the results for the Puerto Rican plot illustrate that highly resolved phylogenies derived from DNA barcode sequence data combined with a constraint tree based on APG III are particularly useful in comparative analysis of phylogenetic diversity and will enhance research on the interface between community ecology and evolution.",10.1371/journal.pone.0015409,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We derive the optimal level of foraging activity as a function of resource abundance and predation risk, and we study the long-term effects of these behavioural traits on population dynamics. We compare different models of population dynamics and we show that long-term predictions depend heavily on the model description.

The model assumes the classical foraging predation risk trade-offs: increased activity increases population growth rate, but it also increases mortality rate. The model considers three scenarios: prey only are adaptive, predators only are adaptive, and both species are adaptive. Under all these scenarios, the neutral stability of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is partially lost because the amplitude of maximum oscillation in species numbers is bounded, and the bound is independent of the initial population numbers. Moreover, if both prey and predators behave adaptively, the neutral stability can be completely lost, and a globally stable equilibrium would appear. This is because prey and/or predator switching leads to a piecewise constant prey ( predator) isocline with a vertical ( horizontal) part that limits the amplitude of oscillations in prey and predator numbers, exactly as suggested by Rosenzweig and MacArthur in their seminal work on graphical stability analysis of predator-prey systems. Prey and predator activities in a long-term run are calculated explicitly.

We asked which environmental variables had the strongest impact on intraspecific and interspecific trait variation in the community and which traits were most responsive to the environment. We established a series of plots in a secondary forest in the Chinese subtropics, stratified by successional stages that were defined by the time elapsed since the last logging activities. On a total of 27 plots all woody plants were recorded and a set of individuals of every species was analysed for leaf traits, resulting in a trait matrix of 26 leaf traits for 122 species. A Fourth Corner Analysis revealed that the mean values of many leaf traits were tightly related to the successional gradient. Most shifts in traits followed the leaf economics spectrum with decreasing specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents with successional time. Beside succession, few additional environmental variables resulted in significant trait relationships, such as soil moisture and soil C and N content as well as topographical variables. Not all traits were related to the leaf economics spectrum, and thus, to the successional gradient, such as stomata size and density. By comparing different permutation models in the Fourth Corner Analysis, we found that the trait-environment link was based more on the association of species with the environment than of the communities with species traits. The strong species-environment association was brought about by a clear gradient in species composition along the succession series, while communities were not well differentiated in mean trait composition. In contrast, intraspecific trait variation did not show close environmental relationships. The study confirmed the role of environmental trait filtering in subtropical forests, with traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum being the most responsive ones.",10.1371/journal.pone.0035742,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Subtropical Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,0,1,"traits = stomal density, stomatal area, stomatal length/width, ",

However, data for such an approach are lacking for the vast majority of the species. In this study, we show that a classification based on simple morphological traits may capture much of the variability in functional properties among the phytoplankton. We used information on more than 700 freshwater species, from more than 200 lakes situated in climate zones ranging from subpolar to tropical. Morphological characteristics correlated well with functional properties, such as growth rate and sinking rate, and also with the population size and biomass attained in the field. This suggests that morphology is a good predictor of the functional characteristics of species. Cluster analysis was used to define seven species groups based on morphology. Although some of the clusters are taxonomically homogeneous, others include species of several separate divisions. Functional traits (not used for the classification) differed significantly among the clusters, suggesting that the clusters may indeed represent meaningful functional groups. Advantages of our morphological approach to classification include its objectivity, its independence from taxonomic affiliations, and the relative ease of its application to the majority of species for which physiological traits are unknown and are not readily determined.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02298.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

This paper analyses phytoplankton morphological traits (i.e. volume, surface to volume ratio) in a highly productive subtropical estuary (Rio de la Plata, South America). The goal was to investigate whether morphological variability, weighted by biovolume, supports the hypothesis that light is a key limiting factor for primary producers in this turbid and nutrient-rich estuary. A transect from nearly freshwater to marine stations was sampled with increasing mixing depth, decreasing turbidity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration. Primary production (PP) and total biovolume were highest on the marine side of the turbidity front. In this area, morphologies of different high-order taxa converged towards smaller individual size and higher surface to volume ratio (S/V). Phytoplankton weighted average S/V increased with turbidity along the gradient, while individual size did so with salinity. High S/V and low morphological variability supported higher PP, appearing as responses to cope with light limitation in this environment. Multiple linear regressions indicated that morphological variability alone explained 72 % of PP, reinforcing the utility of trait-based approaches when targeting relations between phytoplankton communities and ecosystem functioning.",10.1007/s00227-014-2568-6,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Marine,Plankton,Estuary,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,,"taxonomic = phytoplanktontraits = volume, surface:volumen",

Here, by targeting a model system with low species richness, we explore the spatial distribution of taxonomic and functional structure of 40 acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities across Southeast China profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and a comprehensive microarray (GeoChip). Similar environmentally dependent patterns of dominant microbial lineages and key functional genes were observed regardless of the large-scale geographical isolation. Functional and phylogenetic beta-diversities were significantly correlated, whereas functional metabolic potentials were strongly influenced by environmental conditions and community taxonomic structure. Using advanced modeling approaches based on artificial neural networks, we successfully predicted the taxonomic and functional dynamics with significantly higher prediction accuracies of metabolic potentials (average Bray-Curtis similarity 87.8) as compared with relative microbial abundances (similarity 66.8), implying that natural AMD microbial assemblages may be better predicted at the functional genes level rather than at taxonomic level. Furthermore, relative metabolic potentials of genes involved in many key ecological functions (for example, nitrogen and phosphate utilization, metals resistance and stress response) were extrapolated to increase under more acidic and metal-rich conditions, indicating a critical strategy of stress adaptation in these extraordinary communities. Collectively, our findings indicate that natural selection rather than geographic distance has a more crucial role in shaping the taxonomic and functional patterns of AMD microbial community that readily predicted by modeling methods and suggest that the model-based approach is essential to better understand natural acidophilic microbial communities.",10.1038/ismej.2015.201,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Other,acid mine drainage,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,traits = metabolic potential.

Here, by using the network-based analyses with three paralleled data sets derived from 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, functional microarray, and predicted metagenome, we test our hypothesis that the network interactions of traits are more conserved than those of taxonomic measures, with significantly lower variation of network characteristics along the environmental gradient in acid mine drainage. The results showed that although the overall network characteristics remained similar, the structural variation was significantly lower at trait levels. The higher conserved individual node topological properties at trait level rather than at species level indicated that the responses of diverse traits remained relatively consistent even though different species played key roles under different environmental conditions. Additionally, the randomization tests revealed that it could not reject the null hypothesis that species- based correlations were random, while the tests suggested that correlation patterns of traits were non-random. Furthermore, relationships between trait-based network characteristics and environmental properties implied that trait-based networks might be more useful in reflecting the variation of ecosystem function.

Autotomy, or the voluntary shedding of body parts, is an extreme antipredator behaviour used by species in more than 100 animal families. Despite the long-standing observation that the propensity for autotomy can vary extensively among populations, how ecology might drive such variation is still poorly understood. 2. We tested the hypothesis that the variation in this extreme behaviour reflects the balance between costs and benefits determined by the local ecological environment. We focused on three ecological factors that can influence the cost-benefit dynamics of autotomy: predation, male-male competition, and food abundance. 3. Using tail autotomy in lizards as the study system, we first built an individual-based model to show that environments with high predation, high food abundance, and low male-male competition favoured individuals that autotomized more readily. Moreover, predation likely maintained the ability to autotomize, whereas male-male competition and food abundance fine-tuned the propensity for autotomy. 4. We used field data from five side-blotched lizard populations to verify model results, as well as to test the explanatory power of our model. Field data supported simulation results regarding the roles predation, male-male competition and food abundance. Our model also successfully explained the variation in the propensity for tail autotomy among those five lizard populations.

Abiotic and biotic filtering are deterministic processes driving community reassembly. A functional trait or phylogeny-based approach predicts that environmental filtering induced by clearcut-logging results in functional/phylogenetic clustering in younger forests, while biotic filtering (competitive exclusion) promotes functional/phylogenetic overdispersion in old-growth forests. From this perspective, we examined the patterns of functional/phylogenetic structures using tree community data (147 species x 170 plots). These data were chronosequenced from clearcut secondary forests to old-growth subtropical forests in the Ryukyu Archipelago, with species' trait data (leaf and stem) and species level phylogeny. To detect clustering or overdispersion in the functional and phylogenetic structures, we calculated the standardized effect size of mean nearest trait distance and mean nearest phylogenetic distance within the plots. Functional or phylogenetic clustering was relatively weak in secondary forests, and their directional change with increasing forest age was not generally detected. Mean nearest trait/phylogenetic distance for most plots fell within the range of random expectation. The results suggest that abiotic/biotic filtering related to functional traits or phylogenetic relatedness plays a diminished role in shaping species assembly during secondary succession in the subtropical forest. Our findings of functional and phylogenetic properties might shed light on the importance of dispersal (stochastic) processes in the regional species pool during community reassembly after anthropogenic disturbance.

Decline can now be compared both between species and in different parts of species' ranges. We extracted data from distribution atlases to compare range persistence of 736 plant species common to both the UK and Estonia between survey periods encompassing almost the same years (1969 and 1999 in the UK and 1970 and 2004 in Estonia). We determined which traits were most closely associated with variation in species persistence, whether these were the same in each country, and the extent to which they explained differences in persistence between the countries. Mean range size declined less in Estonia than in the UK (24.3% vs. 30.3%). One-third of species in Estonia (239) maintained >90% of their distribution range compared with one-fifth (141) in the UK. In Estonia, 99 species lost >50% of their range compared with 127 species in the UK. Persistence was very positively related to original range in both countries. Major differences in species persistence between the studied countries were primarily determined by biogeographic (affiliation to floristic element) and ecoevolutionary (plant strategy) factors.

Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed.

Species assemblages of naturally disturbed habitats are governed by the prevailing disturbance regime. Consequently, stochastic flood events affect river banks and the inhabiting biota. Predatory arthropods occupy predominantly river banks in relation to specific habitat conditions. Therefore, species sorting and stochastic processes as induced by flooding are supposed to play important roles in structuring riparian arthropod assemblages in relation to their habitat preference and dispersal ability. 2. To ascertain whether assemblages of spiders and carabid beetles from disturbed river banks are structured by stochastic or sorting mechanisms, diversity patterns and assemblage-wide trait-displacements were assessed based on pitfall sampling data. We tested if flooding disturbance within a lowland river reach affects diversity patterns and trait distribution in both groups. 3. Whereas the number of riparian spider species decreased considerably with increased flooding, carabid beetle diversity benefited from intermediate degrees of flooding. Moreover, regression analyses revealed trait-displacements, reflecting sorting mechanisms particularly for spiders. Increased flooding disturbance was associated with assemblage-wide increases of niche breadth, shading and hygrophilic preference and ballooning propensity for spider (sub)families. Trait patterns were comparable for Bembidiini carabids, but were less univocal for Pterostichini species. Body size decreased for lycosid spiders and Bembidiini carabids with increased flooding, but increased in linyphiid spiders and Pterostichini carabids. 4. Our results indicate that mainly riparian species are disfavoured by either too high or too low degrees of disturbance, whereas eurytopic species benefit from increased flooding. Anthropogenic alterations of flooding disturbance constrain the distribution of common hygrophilous species and/or species with high dispersal ability, inducing shifts towards less specialized arthropod assemblages.

However, phylogenetic approaches have rarely been applied to monitoring long-term community change or guiding management. We analysed a 25-year resampling data set (1976-2001) of 41 tallgrass prairie remnants (Illinois, USA) to test for phylogenetic signals of plant community structure, change, environmental associations, fire management and functional traits. A community phylogeny was constructed using GenBank sequences, and trait data were acquired from the TRY consortium. Phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity were compared with taxonomic and functional measures. From 1976 to 2001, communities became more phylogenetically clustered relative to null model expectations, that is increasingly restricted to subsets of species more closely related than expected by chance. Phylogeny was a sensitive indicator of environmental gradients and fire management. There were strong relationships between phylogeny and traits: key traits were phylogenetically non-random and phylogenetic diversity was a necessary complement to species richness for explaining variation in trait diversity. Phylogeny revealed a shift in community structure over time, with sites having been phylogenetically random in 1976 but becoming differentiated from each other by 2001. In contrast, measures of taxonomic and functional diversity showed differentiation at both time points. Phylogenetic patterns likely reflected changes in species' abundances mediated by the influence of environmental conditions and fire frequency.Synthesis and applications. Phylogenetic analyses can elucidate factors central to sound monitoring and management of plant communities. In this system, phylogeny was not a proxy for other indicators, but provided information complementing taxonomic-based and trait-based approaches for understanding vegetation structure, change and response to fire management.

By combining experiments, field surveys and analysis against null models, we tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic habitat modification disrupts species co-occurrence in stream invertebrates across spatial scales. Whereas communities in unmodified conditions were structured deterministically with significant species segregation, catchment-scale conversion to agriculture and sedi- ment deposition at the patch- or micro-habitat scale apparently randomized species co-occurrences. This shift from non-random to random was mostly independent of species richness, abundance and spatial scale. Data on commu- nity-wide life-history traits (body size, dispersal ability and predatory habits) and beta-diversity indicated that anthropogenic modification disrupted community assembly by affecting biotic interactions and, to a lesser extent, altering habitat heterogeneity. These data illustrate that the balance between predictable and stochastic patterns in communities can reflect anthropogenic modifications that not only transcend scales but also change the relative forces that determine species coexistence.

For the first time, we examined whether trait relatedness across germination and seedling stages allows the identification of general recruitment strategies which share core functional attributes and also correspond to recruitment outcomes in applied settings. We measured six seed and eight seedling traits (lab- and field-collected, respectively) for 47 varieties of dryland grasses and used principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis to identify major dimensions of trait variation and to isolate trait-based recruitment groups, respectively. PCA highlighted some links between seed and seedling traits, suggesting that relative growth rate and root elongation rate are simultaneously but independently associated with seed mass and initial root mass (first axis), and with leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, coleoptile tissue density and germination rate (second axis). Third and fourth axes captured separate tradeoffs between hydrothermal time and base water potential for germination, and between specific root length and root mass ratio, respectively. Cluster analysis separated six recruitment types along dimensions of germination and growth rates, but classifications did not correspond to patterns of germination, emergence or recruitment in the field under either of two watering treatments.

We lack, however, a general framework to understand and predict differences in these critical demographic processes across species. Functional traits influence fitness, and consequently, trait variation could provide the basis for a framework to explain and predict variation in life stage transition probabilities.We used seed and seedling traits, and field probabilities of germination, emergence, seedling establishment, and survival for 47 varieties of drylands grasses under two watering treatments to identify critical life stage transitions and quantify the effect of traits on cumulative survival through the first growing season.Variation in germination and emergence probabilities explained over 90% of the variation in cumulative survival regardless of seedling survival probabilities or watering treatment, with emergence probability being the strongest predictor of cumulative survival.Coleoptile tissue density and seed mass had significant effects on emergence and germination, respectively, explaining 10-23% of the variation in transition probabilities.Synthesis and applications.

Species that feed across multiple habitat types and trophic levels may impart stability on food webs through the use of readily available, alternative energy pools. In lakes, generalist fish species may take advantage of spatially and temporally variable prey by consuming both benthic and pelagic prey to meet their energy demands. Using stomach content and stable isotope analyses, we examined the feeding habits of fish species in Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) lakes to determine the prevalence of generalist feeding strategies as a mechanism for persistence in extreme environments (e.g. low productivity, extreme cold and short growing season). Generalist and flexible feeding strategies were evident in five common fish species. Fish fed on benthic and pelagic (or nektonic) prey and across trophic levels. Three species were clearly omnivorous, feeding on fish and their shared invertebrate prey. Dietary differences based on stomach content analysis often exceeded 70%, and overlap in dietary niches based on shared isotopic space varied from zero to 40%. Metrics of community-wide trophic structure varied with the number and identity of species involved and on the dietary overlap and niche size of individual fishes. Accumulation of energy from shared carbon sources by Arctic fishes creates redundancy in food webs, increasing likely resistance to perturbations or stochastic events.

Do domestic ungulate impacts differ between small-seeded pioneers and large-seeded late successional species? Location Birchbeech secondary forest (Betula celtiberica and Fagus sylvatica), Bizkaia, Northern Spain. Methods We conducted a detailed spatial analysis of 216 permanent 1-m2 subplots that were distributed among six plots, of which three were fenced (each plot was 3600-m2) and three were unfenced (each plot was 1296-m2). Within each subplot, the emergence and survival rates of all tree, shrub and vine species were monitored. In total, 21 censuses of the subplots were conducted across 4 yr (19982001). Ungulate abundance was measured by using the pellet counting method. Structural equation models were applied to model the entire recruitment process. Results Emergence and survival rates differed between small- and large-seeded species, and the effect of domestic ungulates (primarily sheep) on these rates depended on seed traits. Sheep did not affect the emergence of large-seeded species (e.g. beech and ivy), but did result in a decline in their survival. In contrast, the emergence of small-seeded species (e.g. birch) was promoted through an increase in bare soil cover because of trampling by the ungulates, but no significant effect on survival was observed. Interestingly, the sheep prompted differences in the role of the understorey vegetation: the understorey composition was able to promote the survival of large-seeded species growing in unfenced conditions by reducing the risk of herbivore predation, but had a negative effect on the survival of small-seeded species because of low light availability under the shaded shrub canopies. Conclusions Our results clearly highlight that sheep can change the seedling bank structure in a secondary temperate forest, thereby affecting the dynamics and structure of forest remnants.

However, stabilizing interspecific niche differences can promote local diversity. Understanding these mechanisms requires that we simultaneously quantify their effects on demography and link these effects to community dynamics. Successional forests are ideal systems for testing assembly theory because they exhibit rapid community assembly. Here, we leverage functional trait and long-term demographic data to build spatially explicit models of successional community dynamics of lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. First, we ask what the effects and relative importance of four trait-mediated community assembly processes are on tree survival, a major component of fitness. We model trait correlations with relative fitness differences that are both density-independent and -dependent in addition to trait correlations with stabilizing niche differences. Second, we ask how the relative importance of these trait-mediated processes relates to successional changes in functional diversity. Tree dynamics were more strongly influenced by trait-related interspecific variation in average survival than trait-related responses to neighbors, with wood specific gravity (WSG) positively correlated with greater survival. Our findings also suggest that competition was mediated by stabilizing niche differences associated with specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC).

Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates.

Here we explored the role that herbivores play in restricting the niche of serpentine ecotypes of the native California annual Collinsia sparsiflora. We planted seeds from four populations into a range of natural field environments that varied in the presence/absence of naturally occurring C. sparsiflora and in predicted suitability for growth and survival of the serpentine ecotype of C. sparsiflora. Path analysis was then used to model the direct and herbivore-mediated indirect effects of environmental variables on the survival of C. sparsiflora serpentine ecotypes. We found that C. sparsiflora received more herbivory when planted into areas where serpentine ecotypes of C. sparsiflora were not predicted to persist, and that increased herbivory was associated with decreased survival, suggesting that herbivores may limit the distribution of C. sparsiflora serpentine ecotypes. Additionally, we demonstrated that edaphic environmental variables impacted the survival of C. sparsiflora serpentine ecotypes both directly and indirectly, by altering interactions with herbivores. These indirect effects were probably trait-mediated and probably occurred because edaphic factors may influence plant traits that, in turn, alter attractiveness to herbivores. Although the magnitude of direct effects exceeded the magnitude of indirect effects, many strong herbivore-mediated indirect effects were detected. Thus, interactions between the abiotic environment and insect herbivory contributed to restricting the niche of C. sparsiflora serpentine ecotypes to a subset of available habitat.",10.1890/07-0591.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, the experiments required to test these models are dictated by practical constraints, and models are often opportunistically validated against data for which they were never intended. Alternatively, we can inform and improve experimental design by an in-depth pre-experimental analysis of the model, generating experiments better targeted at testing the validity of a theory. Here, we describe this process for a specific experiment. Starting from food web ecological theory, we formulate a model and design an experiment to optimally test the validity of the theory, supplementing traditional design considerations with model analysis. The experiment itself will be run and described in a separate paper. The theory we test is that trophic population dynamics are dictated by species traits, and we study this in a community of terrestrial arthropods. We depart from the Allometric Trophic Network (ATN) model and hypothesize that including habitat use, in addition to body mass, is necessary to better model trophic interactions. We therefore formulate new terms which account for micro-habitat use as well as intra-and interspecific interference in the ATN model. We design an experiment and an effective sampling regime to test this model and the underlying assumptions about the traits dominating trophic interactions. We arrive at a detailed sampling protocol to maximize information content in the empirical data obtained from the experiment and, relying on theoretical analysis of the proposed model, explore potential shortcomings of our design. Consequently, since this is a ""pre-experimental"" exercise aimed at improving the links between hypothesis formulation, model construction, experimental design and data collection, we hasten to publish our findings before analyzing data from the actual experiment, thus setting the stage for strong inference.",10.1371/journal.pone.0195919,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Laughlin, Daniel C.; Joshi, Chaitanya",2015,Theoretical consequences of trait-based environmental filtering for the breadth and shape of the niche: New testable hypotheses generated by the Traitspace model,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Every species on Earth fills a unique environmental niche that is driven, in part, by the process of environmental filtering, where the adaptive value of the functional traits of individuals determine their fitness within the given environmental conditions. Despite its long-standing importance in ecology, theoretical investigations of environmental filtering have lagged behind studies of species interactions and neutral dynamics. A new statistical model of trait-based environmental filtering can be a useful tool for exploring the logical consequences of this process while holding all other processes constant. The model uses the logic of objective Bayesian inference to compute the probabilities of species within different environments using two sources of information: the location and dispersion of species within functional trait space, and the statistical relationship between traits and environmental gradients. By varying key parameters in the model, we highlight several testable hypotheses for trait-based ecology. First, niche breadth decreases as intraspecific trait variation decreases, as the strength of the environmental filter increases, and if the trait values do not enhance fitness in any environmental condition in the landscape. Second, niche shape is determined by the form of the trait-environment relationships, where species with extreme trait values are predicted to dominate at the environmental extremes when traits are linearly related to the environment, species with intermediate trait values generally have a selective advantage across a broader environmental range, and bimodal species response curves can occur independently from negative species interactions. The generality of these modelling results can be tested using empirical data from any ecosystem. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Laughlin, DC",2014,The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits and its relevance to community assembly,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that are measured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. A variety of linear and nonlinear methods were used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in the most comprehensive data set. The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits.Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs whenever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining community assembly across different ecosystems.",10.1111/1365-2745.12187,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

A hierarchy of predictability has been proposed that ranks measures of restoration success from most-to-least predictable in the following order: vegetation structure > taxonomic diversity > functional diversity > taxonomic composition. This hierarchy has not been tested empirically, and the location within the hierarchy of trait-based measures, such as community-level trait means and variances, is not well understood. Our objective was to test the hierarchy of predictability in one of the longest running ecological restoration experiments in the western USA. We used linear mixed effects models to analyse changes in herbaceous biomass, species richness, two functional diversity (FD) indices, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and taxonomic composition among experimental restoration treatments from 1992 to 2014 in a ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem. Restoration treatments included combinations of light or heavy tree thinning and no fire or repeated prescribed fire every 4years to release the herbaceous understorey from overstorey competition. Herbaceous biomass and species richness were the two most predictable and least variable measures of success, whereas taxonomic composition exhibited the highest variability among plots through time. Trait-based measures of FD tended to be more predictable and less variable than CWM trait values in this experiment. Both CWM trait values and FD were less variable among plots than taxonomic composition. Synthesis and applications. Ecosystem properties that are intrinsically more variable over space and time will often be the least predictable restoration outcomes. Restoration practitioners can expect vegetation structure, species richness and functional diversity to be more predictable and less variable than taxonomic composition, which can exhibit dynamic responses to restoration treatments over time. Monitoring dominant native and invasive species will always be important, but given the functional redundancy that can occur within communities, strict targets based on composition may rarely be met. Trait-based metrics that integrate taxonomic composition into their calculation are less variable and potentially more meaningful for evaluating ecosystem responses.

However, an unprecedented level of anthropogenic influences is reducing the resilience and stability of our forest ecosystems as well as their ecosystem functions. The relationships between drivers, stress, and ecosystem functions in forest ecosystems are complex, multi-faceted, and often non-linear, and yet forest managers, decision makers, and politicians need to be able to make rapid decisions that are data-driven and based on short and long-term monitoring information, complex modeling, and analysis approaches. A huge number of long-standing and standardized forest health inventory approaches already exist, and are increasingly integrating remote-sensing based monitoring approaches. Unfortunately, these approaches in monitoring, data storage, analysis, prognosis, and assessment still do not satisfy the future requirements of information and digital knowledge processing of the 21st century. Therefore, this paper discusses and presents in detail five sets of requirements, including their relevance, necessity, and the possible solutions that would be necessary for establishing a feasible multi-source forest health monitoring network for the 21st century. Namely, these requirements are: (1) understanding the effects of multiple stressors on forest health; (2) using remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor forest health; (3) coupling different monitoring approaches; (4) using data science as a bridge between complex and multidimensional big forest health (FH) data; and (5) a future multi-source forest health monitoring network. It became apparent that no existing monitoring approach, technique, model, or platform is sufficient on its own to monitor, model, forecast, or assess forest health and its resilience. In order to advance the development of a multi-source forest health monitoring network, we argue that in order to gain a better understanding of forest health in our complex world, it would be conducive to implement the concepts of data science with the components: (i) digitalization; (ii) standardization with metadata management after the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; (iii) Semantic Web; (iv) proof, trust, and uncertainties; (v) tools for data science analysis; and (vi) easy tools for scientists, data managers, and stakeholders for decision-making support.",10.3390/rs10071120,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Lavorel, S; Garnier, E",2002,Predicting changes in community composition and ecosystem functioning from plant traits: revisiting the Holy Grail,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context.

Under climate change, with more frequent stresses and novel shocks, 'climate adaptation services', are defined as the benefits to people from increased social ability to respond to change, provided by the capability of ecosystems to moderate and adapt to climate change and variability. They broaden the ecosystem services framework to assist decision makers in planning for an uncertain future with new choices and options. We present a generic framework for operationalising the adaptation services concept. Four steps guide the identification of intrinsic ecological mechanisms that facilitate the maintenance and emergence of ecosystem services during periods of change, and so materialise as adaptation services. We applied this framework for four contrasted Australian ecosystems. Comparative analyses enabled by the operational framework suggest that adaptation services that emerge during trajectories of ecological change are supported by common mechanisms: vegetation structural diversity, the role of keystone species or functional groups, response diversity and landscape connectivity, which underpin the persistence of function and the reassembly of ecological communities under severe climate change and variability. Such understanding should guide ecosystem management towards adaptation planning.",10.1111/gcb.12689,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Three key functional traits [plant height, leaf area (LA) and specific leaf area (SLA)] were assessed to quantify the range of ITV of four dominant plant species along a rainfall gradient in semi-arid Mediterranean shrublands. Variance partitioning and confirmatory multilevel path analyses were used to assess the direct and indirect effects of rainfall, space limitation (crowding) and neighbouring plant traits on ITV. The direct effect of the local neighbourhood on the trait values of subordinate individuals was as strong as the effect of rainfall. The indirect effect of rainfall, however, mediated by the effect of the local neighbourhood on the trait values of subordinate individuals, was weak. Rainfall decreased the height and SLA of subordinate individuals, but increased their LA. Neighbouring plant traits were just as strong predictors as crowding in explaining changes in ITV.Synthesis. Our study provides a framework to disentangle the direct effects of abiotic factors and their indirect effects on ITV mediated by the local neighbourhood.

Biotic interactions exert considerable influence on the distribution of individual species and should, thus, strongly impact communities. Implementing biotic interactions in spatial models of community assembly is therefore essential for accurately modelling assemblage properties. However, this remains a challenge due to the difficulty of detecting the role of species interactions and because accurate paired community and environment data sets are required to disentangle biotic influences from abiotic effects.

However, few studies have tested this hypothesis, and none have explicitly examined the associated prediction that inter-specific interactions between plants may broaden species altitudinal distributions. Here we test this prediction, using fine-scale species distribution data for 156 bryophytes, lichens and vascular plants spanning a 900 m elevational gradient in north-western Finland and Norway, analysed with a niche modelling approach. Species altitudinal ranges of all three groups of plants were more accurately predicted when including the cover of any of the 24 most wide-spread and abundant species (dominants) than when using abiotic variables alone, emphasizing the importance of including relevant biotic predictors in species distribution models. Half of the models showed that species had very low probabilities of occurrence under high cover of dominants, suggesting a strong negative impact of dominant species. Similarly, for species that are predicted to occur irrespective of dominant species cover, 62% of models showed narrower species altitudinal distributions when occurring under high dominant cover, with contractions of species lower and upper elevational limits being common. Nonetheless, high cover of dominant species was associated with upslope range extension in 43 species, and a net range expansion in nearly 10% of all models. Species distributional responses to dominants were only weakly related to species traits, with larger range contractions associated with arctic-alpine dominants. Therefore, dominant species appear to exert a strong influence on the elevational distribution of other species in high latitude environments.",10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07534.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Within the root endosphere, fungi are known to be important for plant nutrition and resistance to stresses. However, description and understanding of the rules governing community assembly in the fungal fraction of the plant microbiome remains scarce. Methods. We used an innovative DNA-and RNA-based analysis of co-extracted nucleic acids to reveal the complexity of the fungal community colonizing the roots of an Agrostis stolonifera population. The normalized RNA/DNA ratio, designated the 'mean expression ratio', was used as a functional trait proxy. The link between this trait and phylogenetic relatedness was measured using the Bloniberg's K statistic. Results. Fungal communities were highly diverse. Only 1.5% of the 635 OTUs detected were shared by all individuals, however these accounted for 33% of the sequence number. The endophytic fungal communities in plant roots exhibit phylogenetic clustering that can be explained by a plant host effect acting as environmental filter. The mean expression ratio' displayed significant but divergent phylogenetic signals between fungal phyla. Discussion. These results suggest that environmental filtering by the host plant favours the co-existence of related and similar OTUs within the Basidiomycota community assembly, whereas the Ascomycota and Glomeromycota communities seem to be impacted by competitive interactions which promote the co-existence of phylogenetically related but ecologically dissimilar OTUs.",10.7717/peerj.3454,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Ian; Reid, Neil",2015,"Biogeography, macroecology and species' traits mediate competitive interactions in the order Lagomorpha",MAMMAL REVIEW,"In addition to abiotic determinants, biotic factors, including competitive, interspecific interactions, limit species' distributions. Environmental changes in human disturbance, land use and climate are predicted to have widespread impacts on interactions between species, especially in the order Lagomorpha due to the higher latitudes and more extreme environmental conditions they occupy. We reviewed the published literature on interspecific interactions in the order Lagomorpha and compared the biogeography, macroecology, phylogeny and traits of species known to interact with those of species with no reported interactions, to investigate how projected future environmental change may affect interactions and potentially alter species' distributions. Thirty-three lagomorph species have competitive interactions reported in the literature; the majority involve hares (Lepus sp.) or the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Key regions for interactions are located between 30-50 degrees N of the Equator, and include eastern Asia (southern Russia on the border of Mongolia) and North America (north-western USA). Closely related, large-bodied, similarly sized species occurring in regions of human-modified, typically agricultural landscapes, or at high elevations, are significantly more likely to have reported competitive interactions than other lagomorph species. We identify species' traits associated with competitive interactions, and highlight some potential impacts that future environmental change may have on interspecific interactions. Our approach using bibliometric and biological data is widely applicable, and with relatively straightforward methodologies, can provide insights into interactions between species. Our results have implications for predicting species' responses to global change, and we advise that capturing, parameterizing and incorporating interspecific interactions into analyses (e.g. species distribution modelling) may be more important than suggested by the literature.",10.1111/mam.12035,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Mammals,Broad,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,1,1,1,"traits = body mass, human population desnity within each species range.

Thus, diversity patterns may be shaped simultaneously at different spatial scales by very distinct processes. Herein we assess whether and how functional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic beta diversities of frog tadpoles are explained by environmental and/or spatial predictors. We implemented a distance-based redundancy analysis to explore variation in components of beta diversity explained by pure environmental and pure spatial predictors, as well as their interactions, at both fine and broad spatial scales. Our results indicated important but complex roles of spatial and environmental predictors in structuring phylogenetic, taxonomic and functional beta diversities. The pure fine-scales spatial fraction was more important in structuring all beta diversity components, especially to functional and tax-onomical spatial turnover. Environmental variables such as canopy cover and vegetation structure were important predictors of all components, but especially to functional and taxonomic beta diversity. We emphasize that distinct factors related to environment and space are affecting distinct components of beta diversity in different ways. Although weaker, phylogenetic beta diversity, which is structured more on biogeographical scales, and thus can be represented by spatially structured processes, was more related to broad spatial processes than other components. However, selected fine-scale spatial predictors denoted negative autocorrelation, which may be revealing the existence of differences in unmeasured habitat variables among samples. Although overall important, local environmental-based processes explained better functional and taxonomic beta diversity, as these diversity components carry an important ecological value.

Recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that an evolutionary history of disturbance might be an important factor. This perspective presents hypotheses regarding the impact of disturbance on the evolution of invasive populations, based on a synthesis of the existing literature. Disturbance might select for life-history traits that are favorable for colonizing novel habitats, such as rapid population growth and persistence. Theoretical results suggest that disturbance in the form of fluctuating environments might select for organismal flexibility, or alternatively, the evolution of evolvability. Rapidly fluctuating environments might favor organismal flexibility, such as broad tolerance or plasticity. Alternatively, longer fluctuations or environmental stress might lead to the evolution of evolvability by acting on features of the mutation matrix. Once genetic variance is generated via mutations, temporally fluctuating selection across generations might promote the accumulation and maintenance of genetic variation. Deeper insights into how disturbance in native habitats affects evolutionary and physiological responses of populations would give us greater capacity to predict the populations that are most likely to tolerate or adapt to novel environments during habitat invasions.

Predicting the future delivery of these services is difficult, because widespread changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, climate and nitrogen (N) inputs are expected. We compiled published data from global change driver manipulation experiments and combined these with climate data to assess grassland biomass responses to CO2 and N enrichment across a range of climates. CO2 and N enrichment generally increased aboveground biomass (AGB) but effects of CO2 enrichment were weaker than those of N. The response to N was also dependent on the amount of N added and rainfall, with a greater response in high precipitation regions. No relationship between response to CO2 and climate was detected within our dataset, thus suggesting that other site characteristics, e. g. soils and plant community composition, are more important regulators of grassland responses to CO2. A statistical model of AGB response to N was used in conjunction with projected N deposition data to estimate changes to future biomass stocks. This highlighted several potential hotspots (e. g. in some regions of China and India) of grassland AGB gain. Possible benefits for C sequestration and forage production in these regions may be offset by declines in plant biodiversity caused by these biomass gains, thus necessitating careful management if ecosystem service delivery is to be maximized. An approach such as ours, in which meta-analysis is combined with global scale model outputs to make large-scale predictions, may complement the results of dynamic global vegetation models, thus allowing us to form better predictions of biosphere responses to environmental change.",10.1098/rstb.2010.0028,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In addition, I explore the evolutionary implications of exceptions that might favour the co-existence of species with dissimilar traits (especially those that determine species' impacts on the environment) and conclude that these implications di?er when species compete for shared resources, interact via shared predators, or interact via both mechanisms.

We found a linear decline in butterfly species richness along the altitudinal gradient, but the phylogenetic relatedness of the butterfly assemblages did not increase with altitude. Compared to butterfly assemblages at lower altitudes, those at higher altitudes were composed of species with larger wings (on average 9 %) which laid an average of 68 % more eggs. In contrast, egg maturation time in butterfly assemblages decreased by about 22 % along the altitudinal gradient. Further, butterfly assemblages at higher altitudes were increasingly dominated by less widespread species. Based on our abundance data, but not on data in the literature, population density increased with altitude, suggesting a reversed density-distribution relationship, with higher population densities of habitat specialists in harsh environments.

Among the multitude of reasons discussed so far for the lack of observed effects is too short of a time span between implementation and monitoring. Yet, studies that explicitly focus on the importance of restoration age are rare.We present a comprehensive study based on 44 river restoration projects in Germany, focusing on standardized benthic invertebrate sampling. A broad gradient ranging from 1 to 25 years in restoration age was available. In contrast to clear improvements in habitat heterogeneity, benthic community responses to restoration were inconsistent when compared to control sections. Taxon richness increased in response to restoration, but abundance, diversity and various assessment metrics did not respond clearly. Restoration age was a poor predictor of community composition and community change, as no significant linear responses could be detected using 34 metrics. Moreover, only 5 out of 34 tested metrics showed non-linear shifts at restoration ages of 2 to 3 years. This might be interpreted as an indication of a post-restoration disturbance followed by a re-establishment of pre-restoration conditions. BIO-ENV analysis and fourth-corner modeling underlined the low importance of restoration age, but revealed high importance of catchment-scale characteristics (e.g., ecoregion, catchment size and land use) in controlling community composition and community change.Overall, a lack of time for community development did not appear to be the ultimate reason for impaired benthic invertebrate communities. Instead, catchment-scale characteristics override the effectiveness of restoration. To enhance the ecological success of future river restoration projects, we recommend improving water quality conditions and catchment-scale processes (e.g., connectivity and hydrodynamics) in addition to restoring local habitat structure.

A continuum has been described ranging from small-bodied, sedentary, solitary or socially monogamous, forest- or bush-dwelling, browsing species that seek shelter from predation in dense vegetation, to large-bodied, migratory, highly gregarious, grazing taxa inhabiting open savannahs and relying on flight or group-defense behaviors when facing predators. Here, we examined a geographically widespread Glade within the Bovidae (the genus Gazella) that shows minimal interspecific variation in body size and asked if we could still uncover correlated changes of key ecological and behavioral traits during repeated transitions from open-land to mountain-dwelling. Our study used a multi-locus phylogeny (based on sequence variation of Cytb and six nuclear intron markers) of all extant members of the genus Gazella to infer evolutionary patterns of key ecological and behavioral traits and to estimate ancestral character states using Bayesian inference. At the base of the Gazella-phylogeny, open plains were inferred as the most likely habitat type, and three independent transitions toward mountain-dwelling were uncovered. Those shifts coincided with shifts from migratory to sedentary lifestyles. Character estimation for group size was largely congruent with movement patterns in that species forming large groups tended to be migratory, while small group size was correlated with a sedentary lifestyle. Evolutionary patterns of two other conspicuous traits (twinning ability vs. exclusive singleton births and hornless vs. horned females) did not follow this trend in the Gazella-phylogeny. Furthermore, we inferred the genus Gazella to have emerged in the Late Miocene to Pliocene (10-3 Mya), and estimating ancestral ranges based on a Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis model found the Middle East to be the most likely origin of the genus.

In this work, we used an approach based on functional traits to analyse if changes in hydroperiod and tree covers of ponds are relevant for local amphibian community assembly processes. Ephemeral ponds with low vegetation cover are expected to impose constraints on different species with particular trait combinations and, therefore, to exhibit communities with lower functional diversity than more stable ponds with greater tree cover. Sampling was conducted in 39 temporary ponds located along vegetation and hydroperiod gradients in the most arid portion of the Chaco ecoregion. Seven functional traits were measured in each species present in the regional pool. Associations between these traits and environmental gradients were detected using multivariate ordination techniques and permutation test (RLQ and fourth-corner analyses respectively). Functional diversity indices were then calculated and related to variations in the environmental gradients. The results obtained allowed us to identify different sets of traits associated with hydroperiod and tree cover, suggesting that these environmental variables are relevant for structuring amphibian communities according to interspecific variations in functional traits from both, larval and adult stages. Contrary to our expectations, communities associated with more stable ponds and with greater tree cover exhibited lower functional diversity than expected by chance (and were the ponds with highest species richness). This result indicates that the reduction in relative importance of environmental restrictions imposed by a very short hydroperiod and the lack of tree cover, favours different species of the regional pool that are similar in several functional traits. Accordingly, communities associated with stable ponds with high tree cover exhibited high functional redundancy.",10.1111/aec.12607,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Herps,Ponds,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"taxonomic = amphibeans.

"Lester, PJ",2005,Determinants for the successful establishment of exotic ants in New Zealand,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"Biological invasions can dramatically alter ecosystems. An ability to predict the establishment success for exotic species is important for biosecurity and conservation purposes. I examine the exotic New Zealand ant fauna for characteristics that predict or determine an exotic species' ability to establish. Quarantine records show interceptions of 66 ant species: 17 of which have established, 43 have faded to establish, whereas nests of another six are periodically observed but have failed to establish permanently (called 'ephemeral' establishment). Mean temperature at the highest latitude and interception variables were the only factors significantly different between established, failed or ephemeral groups. Aspects of life history, such as competitive behaviour and morphology, were not different between groups. However, in a stepwise discriminant analysis, small size was a key factor influencing establishment success. Interception rate and climate were also secondarily important. The resulting classification table predicted establishment success with 71% accuracy. Because not all exotic species are represented in quarantine records, a further discriminant model is described without interception data.

The vast majority of studies conducted to date have comprised static analyses where communities are observed at a single snapshot in time. Long-term datasets present a vantage point to compare established and emerging theoretical predictions on the phylogenetic and functional trajectory of communities through succession. We investigated within, and between, community measures of phylogenetic and functional diversity in a fire-prone heathland along a 21 year time series. Contrary to widely held expectations that increased competition through succession should inhibit the coexistence of species with high niche overlap, plots became more phylogenetically and functionally clustered with time since fire. There were significant directional shifts in individual traits through time indicating deterministic successional processes associated with changing abiotic and/or biotic conditions. However, relative to the observed temporal rate of taxonomic turnover, both phylogenetic and functional turnover were comparatively low, suggesting a degree of functional redundancy among close relatives. These results contribute to an emerging body of evidence indicating that limits to the similarity of coexisting species are rarely observed at fine spatial scales.",10.1098/rspb.2014.2102,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Heathland,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = seed mass, plant height, Raunkiaer life-form, fire response, fecundity, longevity and seedbank persistence",

Dietary analysis based on the stomach contents of individuals caught in several Iberian basins was carried out as a first step to evaluate its potential threat for the native Iberian ichthyofauna. Aquatic macroinvertebrates (mainly Chironomidae) dominated the black bullhead's diet in all size-classes and sites, irrespective of natural riverine or artificial lentic habitats. Secondary prey items were responsible for the observed between-sites (microcrustaceans in artificial lentic habitat; oligochaeta and caddisfly larvae in natural riverine habitats) and ontogenetic diet differences (from microcrustaceans to larger prey). These diet variations were also detected in trophic diversity values and feeding strategy plots. Black bullheads consumed plant material, terrestrial prey and co-occurring fish species (native or exotic) and thus they could be considered as generalist or opportunistic, foraging on the most abundant and available prey. There was no positive relationship between black bullhead size (total length) and fish prey size, probably indicating piscivory on dead or dying vulnerable fishes as well as predation on smaller-sized active fishes. The results showed that the black bullhead could negatively affect native Iberian ichthyofauna throughout direct predation and competition. Aspects of potential conservation and management implications of fishes resulting from the undesirable presence of the black bullhead in Iberian water bodies are discussed.

Aims: A preliminary test for the utility of trait-based assembly rules in explaining cryptogamic epiphyte communities (lichens and bryophytes). Methods: We sampled epiphytes from three different tree species (aspen, birch and pine), and from trees of contrasting age. The community composition of epiphyte species (taxon analysis) and functional groups (trait analysis) was summarised using multivariate ordination (nonmetric multidimensional scaling, NMDS). Results: Ordination documented a widely observed pattern in which different tree species have taxonomically different epiphyte communities. However, NMDS sample scores were correlated to tree age in the trait-based analysis, but not in the taxon analysis. Conclusions: Our results point to the existence of a common pattern in community traits during succession (on trees of different age) when measured for epiphyte communities with contrasting taxonomic composition. This pattern is evidenced by consistent trends in lichen growth form and reproductive strategy (sexual vs. asexual).",unkown_12,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = gorwth form, photbiont partner.

Similarly, functional diversity indices have proven useful for investigating processes governing community assembly, particularly patterns of functional convergence/divergence. This study investigated the functional ecology of biodiverse, seminatural coastal grasslands (Scottish machair) at the national scale. We examined temporal shifts in functional response traits and functional diversity metrics using a series of null model, multivariate and regression analyses. The aim was to link temporal shifts in traits and diversity metrics to environmental variables in which to gauge the contribution of landuse change to plant functional composition and processes governing plant assembly. We observed significant shifts in the composition of 8 out of 12 functional response traits at the national scale, whereas at the regional scale all traits displayed at least one significant shift. Ordination of response traits found PC axis 1 (accounting for 39% of the variation) to be positively correlated to vegetation height and negatively correlated to specific leaf area, similar to that expected along a disturbance gradient. Significant changes in functional diversity indices were also observed at both national and regional scales, with varying convergence/divergence patterns observed across individual regions. We found functional richness (t = 4.87, p < 0.001) and divergence (t = 9.3, p < 0.001) to increase along PC axis 1, suggesting greater convergence and lower divergence along a disturbance gradient. This study demonstrates the potential for using functional diversity indices in combination with response traits as a sensitive method for detecting landuse change and its impacts on biodiversity. We conclude that landuse change, particularly management declines and intensification is a major driver governing change among the functional composition and functional diversity for machair grasslands, influencing convergence/divergence patterns, and subsequently community assembly processes.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00979.x,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = veg height, seed mass, LDMC, seed longevity, SLA, terminal velocity, flowering start, pollen vector, vegetative spread",

Mulberry plants have abundant polyphenols, but very little is known about the mulberry type III polyketide synthase genes. An analysis of these genes may provide new targets for genetic improvement to increase relevant secondary metabolites and enhance the plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Results: Eighteen genes encoding type III polyketide synthases were identified, including six chalcone synthases (CHS), ten stilbene synthases (STS), and two polyketide synthases (PKS). Functional characterization of four genes representing most of the MnCHS and MnSTS genes by coexpression with 4-Coumaroyl-CoA ligase in Escherichia coli indicated that their products were able to catalyze p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to generate naringenin and resveratrol, respectively. Microsynteny analysis within mulberry indicated that segmental and tandem duplication events contributed to the expansion of the MnCHS family, while tandem duplications were mainly responsible for the generation of the MnSTS genes. Combining the evolution and expression analysis results of the mulberry type III PKS genes indicated that MnCHS and MnSTS genes evolved mainly under purifying selection to maintain their original functions, but transcriptional subfunctionalization occurred during long-term species evolution. Moreover, mulberry leaves can rapidly accumulated oxyresveratrol after UV-C irradiation, suggesting that resveratrol was converted to oxyresveratrol. Conclusions: Characterizing the functions and evolution of mulberry type III PKS genes is crucial for advancing our understanding of these genes and providing the basis for further studies on the biosynthesis of relevant secondary metabolites in mulberry plants.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Li, DJ; Ives, AR",2017,The statistical need to include phylogeny in trait-based analyses of community composition,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. A growing number of studies incorporate functional trait information to analyse patterns and processes of community assembly. These studies of trait-environment relationships generally ignore phylogenetic relationships among species. When functional traits and the residual variation in species distributions among communities have phylogenetic signal, however, analyses ignoring phylogenetic relationships can decrease estimation accuracy and power, inflate type I error rates and lead to potentially false conclusions. 2. Using simulations, we compared estimation accuracy, statistical power and type I error rates of linear mixed models (LMM) and phylogenetic linear mixed models (PLMM) designed to test for trait-environment interactions in the distribution of species abundances among sites. We considered the consequences of both phylogenetic signal in traits and phylogenetic signal in the residual variation in species distributions generated by an unmeasured (latent) trait with phylogenetic signal. 3. When there was phylogenetic signal in the residual variation in species among sites, PLMM provided better estimates (closer to the true value) and greater statistical power for testing whether the trait-environment interaction regression coefficient differed from zero. LMM had unacceptably high type I error rates when there was phylogenetic signal in both traits and the residual variation in species distributions. When there was no phylogenetic signal in the residual variation in species distributions, LMM and PLMM had similar performances. 4. Linear mixed models that ignore phylogenetic relationships can lead to poor statistical tests of trait-environment relationships when there is phylogenetic signal in the residual variation in species distributions among sites, such as caused by unmeasured traits. Therefore, phylogenies and PLMMs should be used when studying how functional traits affect species abundances among communities in response to environmental gradients.",10.1111/2041-210X.12767,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Li, DJ; Ives, AR; Waller, DM",2017,Can functional traits account for phylogenetic signal in community composition?,NEW PHYTOLOGIST,"Phylogenetic and functional trait-based analyses inform our understanding of community composition, yet methods for quantifying the overlap in information derived from functional traits and phylogenies remain underdeveloped. Does adding traits to analyses of community composition reduce the phylogenetic signal in the residual variation? If not, then measured functional traits alone may be insufficient to explain community assembly. We propose a general statistical framework to quantify the proportion of phylogenetic pattern in community composition that remains after including measured functional traits. We then illustrate the framework with applications to two empirical data sets. Both data sets showed strong phylogenetic attraction, with related species likely to co-occur in the same communities. In one data set, including traits eliminated all phylogenetic signals in the residual variation of both abundance and presence/absence patterns. In the second data set, including traits reduced phylogenetic signal in residuals by 25% and 98% for abundance and presence/absence data, respectively. Our framework provides an explicit way to estimate how much phylogenetic community pattern remains in the residual variation after including measured functional traits. Knowing that functional traits account for most of the phylogenetic pattern should provide confidence that important traits for phylogenetic community structure have been identified. Conversely, knowing that there is unexplained residual phylogenetic information should spur the search for additional functional traits or other processes underlying community assembly.",10.1111/nph.14397,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Chemical secretions are used for defense against anything from vertebrate or invertebrate predators to prokaryotic or eukaryotic parasites or food competitors. Tenebrionid beetles are especially prolific in this category, producing several varieties of substituted benzoquinone compounds. In order to get a better understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of defensive secretions, we performed RNA sequencing in a newly emerging insect model, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). To detect genes that are highly and specifically expressed in the odoriferous gland tissues that secret defensive chemical compounds, we compared them to a control tissue, the anterior abdomen. 511 genes were identified in different subtraction groups. Of these, 77 genes were functionally analyzed by RNA interference (RNAi) to recognize induced gland alterations morphologically or changes in gland volatiles by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 29 genes (38%) presented strong visible phenotypes, while 67 genes (87%) showed alterations of at least one gland content. Three of these genes showing quinone-less (ql) phenotypes - Tcas-ql VTGl; Tcas-ql ARSB; Tcas-ql MRP - were isolated, molecularly characterized, their expression identified in both types of the secretory glandular cells, and their function determined by quantification of all main components after RNAi. In addition, microbe inhibition assays revealed that a quinone-free status is unable to impede bacterial or fungal growth.

As species richness increases, habitat filtering should constrain the expansion of total niche volume, while limiting similarity should restrict the degree of niche overlap between species. Here, by explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variability, we investigate the relationship between functional niche occupancy and species richness at the global scale. We assembled 21 datasets worldwide, spanning tropical to temperate biomes and consisting of 313 plant communities representing different growth forms. We quantified three key niche occupancy components (the total functional volume, the functional overlap between species and the average functional volume per species) for each community, related each component to species richness, and compared each component to the null expectations. As species richness increased, communities were more functionally diverse (an increase in total functional volume), and species overlapped more within the community (an increase in functional overlap) but did not more finely divide the functional space (no decline in average functional volume). Null model analyses provided evidence for habitat filtering (smaller total functional volume than expectation), but not for limiting similarity (larger functional overlap and larger average functional volume than expectation) as a process driving the pattern of functional niche occupancy.Synthesis. Habitat filtering is a widespread process driving the pattern of functional niche occupancy across plant communities and coexisting species tend to be more functionally similar rather than more functionally specialized.

"Liang, SH; Walther, BA; Shieh, BS",2017,Contrasting determinants for the introduction and establishment success of exotic birds in Taiwan using decision trees models,PEERJ,"Background. Biological invasions have become a major threat to biodiversity, and identifying determinants underlying success at different stages of the invasion process is essential for both prevention management and testing ecological theories. To investigate variables associated with different stages of the invasion process in a local region such as Taiwan, potential problems using traditional parametric analyses include too many variables of different data types (nominal, ordinal, and interval) and a relatively small data set with too many missing values. Methods. We therefore used five decision tree models instead and compared their performance. Our dataset contains 283 exotic bird species which were transported to Taiwan; of these 283 species, 95 species escaped to the field successfully (introduction success); of these 95 introduced species, 36 species reproduced in the field of Taiwan successfully (establishment success). For each species, we collected 22 variables associated with human selectivity and species traits which may determine success during the introduction stage and establishment stage. For each decision tree model, we performed three variable treatments: (I) including all 22 variables, (II) excluding nominal variables, and (III) excluding nominal variables and replacing ordinal values with binary ones. Five performance measures were used to compare models, namely, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), specificity, precision, recall, and accuracy. Results. The gradient boosting models performed best overall among the five decision tree models for both introduction and establishment success and across variable treatments. The most important variables for predicting introduction success were the bird family, the number of invaded countries, and variables associated with environmental adaptation, whereas the most important variables for predicting establishment success were the number of invaded countries and variables associated with reproduction. Discussion. Our final optimal models achieved relatively high performance values, and we discuss differences in performance with regard to sample size and variable treatments. Our results showed that, for both the establishment model and introduction model, the number of invaded countries was the most important or second most important determinant, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that future success for introduction and establishment of exotic birds maybe gauged by simply looking at previous success in invading other countries. Finally, we found that species traits related to reproduction were more important in establishment models than in introduction models; importantly, these determinants. were not averaged but either minimum or maximum values of species traits..

Anthropogenic land use change is an important driver of impacts to biological communities and the ecosystem services they provide. Pollination is one ecosystem service that may be threatened by community disassembly. Relatively little is known about changes in bee community composition in the tropics, where pollination limitation is most severe and land use change is rapid. Understanding how anthropogenic changes alter community composition and functioning has been hampered by high variability in responses of individual species. Trait-based approaches, however, are emerging as a potential method for understanding responses of ecologically similar species to global change.2. We studied how communities of tropical, eusocial stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) disassemble when forest is lost. These bees are vital tropical pollinators that exhibit high trait diversity, but are under considerable threat from human activities.3. We compared functional traits of stingless bee species found in pastures surrounded by differing amounts of forest in an extensively deforested landscape in southern Costa Rica.4. Our results suggest that foraging traits modulate competitive interactions that underlie community disassembly patterns. In contrast to both theoretical predictions and temperate bee communities, we found that stingless bee species with the widest diet breadths were less likely to persist in sites with less forest. These wide-diet-breadth species also tend to be solitary foragers, and are competitively subordinate to group-foraging stingless bee species. Thus, displacement by dominant, group-foraging species may make subordinate species more dependent on the larger or more diversified resource pool that natural habitats offer. We also found that traits that may reduce reliance on treesnesting in the ground or inside nests of other speciescorrelated with persistence in highly deforested landscapes.5. The functional trait perspective we employed enabled capturing community processes in analyses and suggests that land use change may disassemble bee communities via different mechanisms in temperate and tropical areas. Our results further suggest that community processes, such as competition, can be important regulators of community disassembly under land use change. A better understanding of community disassembly processes is critical for conserving and restoring pollinator communities and the ecosystem services and functions they provide.",10.1111/1365-2656.12747,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits =  body size (average head width), colony size (average number of workers), diet breadth, group foraging, nesting in the ground, inquiline nesting (nesting in other species’ nests) and nesting in man‐made structures.

Here we use a phylogenetic comparative analysis to test the association between several putative anti-predator traits and bird predation risk in an assemblage of caterpillar species. We synthesize eight years of field and laboratory study of a temperate forest community, including a four-year bird exclusion experiment that provided comparative measures of bird predation risk for 38 caterpillar species from a phylogenetic community. We then conducted a phylogenetic generalized least-squares and information-theoretic model selection analysis of warning signals (aposematism or mimicry), camouflage (crypsis or masquerade), and behavioral responses to physical attack as predictors of bird predation, while also accounting for putatively important effects of the abundance, mean body size, and phenology of caterpillar species. The most behaviorally specialized caterpillar species possessing warning signals experienced the lowest bird predation risk, supporting aposematism theory and highlighting the role of prey behavior in the visual signaling of predators. Among the camouflaged caterpillar species, those with the greatest latency to detection by human proxy predators experienced the lowest bird predation risk, supporting camouflage theory. Caterpillar behavioral responses to physical attack, however, predicted increased bird predation risk among camouflaged caterpillars. Although caterpillar abundance, body size, and phenology were expected to be important based on inference from optimal foraging theory and previous field observations, these factors had limited predictive power.

Previously, data on community composition at sites has been employed to correlate trait and environmental variables (e.g., RLQ analysis) and to predict community-level expression of quantitative traits (i.e., community aggregated traits). Here, we demonstrate that the selection ratio, a method originating in animal resource selection studies, can estimate the ecological filters that site conditions impose on species traits by combining observed Community aggregated traits with null models of species availability. This flexible, nonparametric approach expresses the filter at each site as a probability density function for the selection of individuals possessing a given trait value. By doing so, it generalizes the community aggregated trait concept to include categorical as well as continuous traits and allows for both intraspecific variation in trait expression and differences in species availability among sites. The resulting site-level filter functions can be related to environmental covariates by standard statistical approaches (e.g., regression).

Functional feeding traits and diet categories were determined from literature sources and observations for 399 predator species. Multivariate analyses were used to identify groups of species that consume similar food resources and have related functional traits corresponding to finding, acquiring and ingesting prey. These analyses distinguished gradients among trophic groups based on dissimilar feeding mechanisms, body sizes, types of locomotion and dietary breadths. Co-occurrences of certain diet categories also emerged as important factors. Trophic groups were largely consistent with species clusters at different taxonomic ranks among the predator phyla. At one extreme, fishes and decapod crustaceans with large dietary breadths and body sizes, and crushing or tearing feeding mechanisms, appear to consume bryozoans as minor or even incidental parts of their diets. At another extreme, species of nudibranchs, pycnogonids, turbellarians, and certain polychaetes, small arthropods and nematodes that consume bryozoans do so primarily or exclusively. Their body sizes are comparatively smaller and they often have piercing and suctorial feeding mechanisms.

To resolve this issue for community test systems, we propose a trait-based approach to detect toxic effects. An experiment with outdoor stream mesocosms was established 2-years before contamination to allow the development of biotic interactions within the community. Following pulse contamination with the insecticide thiacloprid, communities were monitored for additional 2 years to observe long-term effects. Applying a priori ecotoxicological knowledge species were aggregated into trait-based groups that reflected stressor-specific vulnerability of populations to toxicant exposure. This reduces inter-replicate variation that is not related to toxicant effects and enables to better link exposure and effect. Species with low intrinsic sensitivity showed only transient effects at the highest thiacloprid concentration of 100 mu g/l. Sensitive multivoltine species showed transient effects at 3.3 mu g/l. Sensitive univoltine species were affected at 0.1 mu g/l and did not recover during the year after contamination. Based on these results the new indicator SPEAR (mesocosm) was calculated as the relative abundance of sensitive univoltine taxa. Long-term community effects of thiacloprid were detected at concentrations 1,000 times below those detected by the PRC (Principal Response Curve) approach. We also found that those species, characterised by the most vulnerable trait combination, that were stressed were affected more strongly by thiacloprid than non-stressed species. We conclude that the grouping of species according to toxicant-related traits enables identification and prediction of community response to low levels of toxicants and that additionally the environmental context determines species sensitivity to toxicants.",10.1007/s10646-011-0689-y,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Liew, JH; Carrasco, LR; Tan, HH; Yeo, DCJ",2016,Native richness and species level trophic traits predict establishment of alien freshwater fishes,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"Community level ecological traits are thought to affect invasibility as more diverse communities with complex trophic interactions may be associated with greater biotic resistance. Elucidation of the nature of this relationship is often hampered by difficulties in characterising food webs, particularly where field data are lacking. We attempted to overcome this by coupling food web modelling with information-theoretic analysis of the modelled webs. In addition, we also investigated the possibility that species level trends in trophic traits of established aliens might reflect exploitation of empty niches. We constructed hypothetical food webs of 26 natural and artificial lentic habitats from a data set consisting of 370 fish species representing 71 families. Using these food webs, we investigated associations at the community level between food web traits and network topology and number of alien fish species using an information-theoretic approach based on a set of competing a priori hypotheses. At the species level, we similarly tested for trends in trophic traits of established alien fishes using the information-theoretic approach in addition to nMDS of diet data. We found that native species richness in a community was the most important determinant of the number of alien fish taxa, displaying an inverse relationship. Our data also show that alien fish generally feed lower down the food web. Our findings suggest that the biotic resistance hypothesis, though scale dependent, can result in observable effects in animal communities. Moreover, we also found that the ability to exploit low energy yield food sources could favour the establishment of alien species via avoidance of resistive forces from native taxa.",10.1007/s10530-016-1241-z,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,food web not species traits,
"Lim, JY; Fine, PVA; Mittelbach, GG",2015,Assessing the latitudinal gradient in herbivory,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Plant-herbivore interactions occur in all ecosystems and provide a major avenue for energy flow to higher trophic levels. A long-standing hypothesis to explain the latitudinal gradient in species diversity proposes that the relatively stable and frost-free climate of the tropics should lead to more intense biotic interactions in tropical compared with temperate environments, giving rise to a greater diversity of plants and herbivores. Herbivory rates have been compared across latitudes to test this biotic interactions hypothesis, with herbivory typically being measured from observable leaf damage. However, we argue that a measure of percentage leaf damage alone does not straightforwardly reflect the cost of herbivory to the plant, and on its own does not constitute an appropriate test of the biotic interactions hypothesis. For a given amount of herbivory, the impact of herbivory is dependent upon many factors, such as the construction cost of the leaf, the growth and replacement rates and leaf life span. We investigate the latitudinal gradient in herbivory by analysing a large dataset of herbivory rates for 452 tree species and separating the species into those with short and long leaf life spans. We show that annual herbivory rates tend to be greater at lower latitudes for evergreen species (which have long-lived leaves), but no trend in herbivory rate with latitude was found for species with short leaf life spans. Phylogenetic least squares regression assuming Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes also showed a negative effect of latitude on herbivory rate for evergreen trees, but we caution that viewing herbivory as a species trait is problematic. An integrative approach that incorporates leaf life span, as well as the costs of investment in growth and potential costs of losing leaf tissue, is needed to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of herbivory.",10.1111/geb.12336,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The sharp decline in the biodiversity of impacted rivers demands the enhancement of available tools for biomonitoring and improved approaches for informing environmental decision-making. Here, we demonstrate examples of how fish trait analyses could be used to assess and predict the response of fish communities to damming and how this approach has potential advantages over traditionally used methods by linking suites of traits to stressor effects through plausible cause and effect mechanisms. Using a trait-based analysis is advantageous as it transcends taxonomy, can be applied across broad spatial scales and be easily integrated into current assessment programs. Therefore, it is a promising tool for biomonitoring in freshwater ecosystems. However, some challenges remain in the application of this approach namely the lack of universality of trait-habitat links; the availability, consistency, and applicability of existing trait data; low discriminatory power and poor mechanistic understanding. Nonetheless adaptive river management can benefit from this approach by sustainably operating dams in the light of knowledge on how the functional structure of fish communities are altered, thus enabling essential habitats for fish to be maintained.",10.1007/s11160-016-9446-x,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = feeding type, spawning location, spawning season, nest-defence behaviour",

All-females depend on the sperm of their sexual ancestors. Strong competition among all-females and their coexistent sexual host take place. The frozen niche-variation model was proposed to explain how such coexistence is possible and how the genetic diversity of all-female biotypes arose. According to this model, the hybrids have multiple origins, freeze and replicate unique genotypes, and produce phenotypic differences with reduced ecological overlap with one another and their sexual ancestors. The objective of the study was to test whether differences in predatory efficiency of ah-females are 'frozen' from the sexual ancestor which possessed phenotypic diversity for that behavioural trait. I investigated predatory efficiency in nine strains of Poeciliopsis (I! monacha, two natural hybrids, and six laboratory made hybrids). First, I analysed the variation in average performances of each strain for time spent in capture and handling of two prey species (Artemia salina and Daphnia magna). Second, I offered bath prey simultaneously to test if preference affects the average time spent to handle prey. Preference for prey species was analysed using the order of capture as reference.

"Lind, Eric M.; Barbosa, Pedro",2010,Life history traits predict relative abundance in an assemblage of forest caterpillars,ECOLOGY,"Species in a given trophic level occur in vastly unequal abundance, a pattern commonly documented but poorly explained for most taxa. Theoretical predictions of species density such as those arising from the metabolic theory of ecology hold well at large spatial and temporal scales but are not supported in many communities sampled at a relatively small scale. At these scales ecological factors may be more important than the inherent limits to energy use set by allometric scaling of mass. These factors include the amount of resources available, and the ability of individuals to convert these resources successfully into population growth. While previous studies have demonstrated the limits of macroecological theory in explaining local abundance, few studies have tested alternative generalized mechanisms determining abundance at the community scale. Using an assemblage of forest moth species found co-occurring as caterpillars on a single host plant species, we tested whether species abundance on that plant could be explained by mass allometry, intrinsic population growth, diet breadth, or some combination of these traits. We parameterized life history traits of the caterpillars in association with the host plant in both field and laboratory settings, so that the population growth estimate was specific to the plant on which abundance was measured.Using a generalized least-squares regression method incorporating phylogenetic relatedness, we found no relationship between abundance and mass but found that abundance was best explained by both intrinsic population growth rate and diet breadth. Species population growth potential was most affected by survivorship and larval development time on the host plant. Metabolic constraints may determine upper limits to local abundance levels for species, but local community abundance is strongly predicted by the potential for population increase and the resources available to that species in the environment.",10.1890/09-1894.1,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = mass allometry, growth, diet breadth",

Such linkage patterns are predicted by models of the evolution of sexually antagonistic genes. Subsequent recombination of attractive male characters from the Y to the X would create physical linkage between attractive male trait and preference. A literature survey shows that Y linkage of potentially sexually antagonistic traits is common in poeciliid fishes and other species with sex chromosomes that are Hot well differentiated, but may also occur in taxa with degenerate Y chromosomes. In the guppy, attractive male traits are primarily Y and X linked; a literature review of the inheritance of sex-limited attractive male characters suggests that 16 are Y linked, 24 recombine between the X and Y, two are X linked, and two are autosomal. Crosses and backcrosses between high female preference (Endler's live-bearers) and low female preference (Rio San Miguel) guppy populations show that this character has a strong additive genetic component and that it will be possible to investigate the physical linkage of male and female sexually selected characters in this species through mapping studies.",10.1086/342898,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Food-dependent growth and within-species size variation depend on temperature and affect community dynamics through feedbacks between individual performance and population size structure. Still, we know little about how warming affects these feedbacks. Using a dynamic stage-structured biomass model with food-, size- and temperature-dependent life history processes, we analyse how temperature affects coexistence, stability and size structure in a tri-trophic food chain, and find that warming effects on community stability depend on ecological interactions. Predator biomass densities generally decline with warming - gradually or through collapses - depending on which consumer life stage predators feed on. Collapses occur when warming induces alternative stable states via Allee effects.

"Little, CJ; Altermatt, F",2018,Species turnover and invasion of dominant freshwater invertebrates alter biodiversity-ecosystem-function relationship,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had lower biomass-adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.",10.1002/ecm.1299,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Phylogenetic comparative models can be used to disentangle the relative roles of spatial and phylogenetic factors in explaining trait variances. Here, we analyse variances in plant traits and environmental variables of the widely distributed and early diverging Magnoliaceae within a phylogeographical context to test whether species distributions have been limited more by evolutionary or spatial constraints in this family. Location China. Methods The phylogenetic relatedness and geographical distributions of 183 Magnoliaceae species in China were analysed for phylogenetic clustering or over-dispersion. The phylogenetic signals of 15 plant traits and 12 environmental variables were determined, and the relative contributions of phylogeny and space to each quantitative trait were distinguished using four comparative models. Results Species richness gradually decreased from south to north, with phylogenetic clustering along the southern coast, and in northern and central China. Strong phylogenetic signals were found in leaf form, flowering sequence, diameter at breast height, leaf length and width, mean and minimum mean annual temperature, and minimum mean annual precipitation. Variances of plant diameter, length and width of leaves and tepals, and fruit length were strongly associated with phylogenetic relatedness. In contrast, variances of plant height, flowering and fruiting time, and all of the 12 environmental variables (mean, minimum, maximum and range of altitude, temperature and precipitation) were associated with both spatial proximity and phylogenetic distance between species. Main conclusions Phylogenetic niche conservatism was identified in most of the studied plant traits across the Magnoliaceae. In contrast, environmental variables showed weak phylogenetic signals, but strong spatial signals.

Here, we demonstrate that local scale analysis of co-occurrence patterns is inadequate to fully describe assembly mechanisms and instead utilize a metacommunity and core-satellite approach. We generated a co-occurrence and life-history data set for a community of twig-nesting ants on coffee plants across 36 sites within a tropical agroecosystem to test the following three hypotheses: (1) twig-nesting ant species compete for nest-sites, (2) they are structured as a metacommunity, and (3) core species show segregated patterns, while satellite species show random patterns of co-occurrence. Species were divided into four groups: core species that are well distributed regionally and dominant locally, regional dominants that are well distributed regionally but do not dominate locally, local dominants that are dominant locally but are not widely distributed, and satellites that are neither widely distributed nor dominant locally. Only the most abundant species in the community, Pseudomyrmex simplex, was classified as a core species. Regional dominants, local dominants, and satellite species show random patterns of co-occurrence. However, when P. simplex is included in the co-occurrence matrix, patterns become aggregated for all three species groupings. This suggests that P. simplex ""assembles"" the community by providing a core metapopulation that other species track. Analyzing co-occurrence patterns among candidate subsets of species, at multiple spatial scales, and linking them to species traits substantially improves the explanatory power of co-occurrence analyses in complex metacommunities.",10.1007/s11284-010-0738-7,N,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Tropical Agroecosystem,0,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,1,0,,"I started coding this, but stopped because I don't actually agee that they used 'life history traits' of the species, all they list in their table of supposed life history traits is whether they were a core or regionally dominant species, how many sies were established, how many sites dispersed, how many sites recruited and the mean relative local established abundance.

We compare an ecological nutrient-plant-herbivore food-chain model without evolution with the same model, including herbivore evolution, plant evolution, or both. When only herbivores are allowed to evolve, the predictions are similar to those of the ecological model without evolution, i.e., plant biomass does not change with nutrient addition. When only plants evolve, nutrient enrichment leads to an increase in the biomass of all compartments. In contrast, when plants and herbivores are allowed to coevolve, although these two classical patterns are common, a wide variety of other responses is possible. The form of the trade-offs that constrain evolution of the two protagonists is then critical.

"Loewen, CJG; Vinebrooke, RD",2016,Regional diversity reverses the negative impacts of an alien predator on local species-poor communities,ECOLOGY,"Species diversity is often an implicit source of biological insurance for communities against the impacts of novel perturbations, such as the introduction of an invasive species. High environmental heterogeneity (e.g., a mountainous gradient) is expected to beget greater regional species diversity and variation in functional traits related to environmental tolerances. Thus, heterogeneous metacommunities are expected to provide more tolerant colonists that buffer stressed local communities in the absence of dispersal limitation. We tested the hypothesis that importation of a regional zooplankton pool assembled from a diverse array of lakes and ponds lessens the impacts of a novel predator on local species-poor alpine communities by increasing response diversity (i.e., diversity of tolerances to environmental change) as mediated by variation in functional traits related to predator evasion. We also tested whether impacts varied with temperature, as warming may modify (e.g., dampen or amplify) invasion effects. An eight-week factorial experiment ([fishless vs. introduced Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout)]x[ambient temperature vs. heated]x[local vs. local+regional species pool]) was conducted using 32 1,000-L mesocosms. Associations between experimental treatments and species functional traits were tested by R-mode linked to Q-mode (RLQ) and fourth-corner analyses. Although the introduced predator suppressed local species richness and community biomass, colonization by several montane zooplankters reversed these negative effects, resulting in increased species diversity and production. Invasion resistance was unaffected by higher temperatures, which failed to elicit any significance impacts on the community. We discovered that the smaller body sizes of imported species drove functional overcompensation (i.e., increased production) in invaded communities. The observed ecological surprise showed how regionally sourced biodiversity from a highly heterogeneous landscape can offset, and even reverse, the local negative impacts of an invasive species. Further, prey body size was found to be a keyspecies trait mediating the ecological impacts of the aquatic invasive predator.

Boldness has been found to be dependent on experience, social, and environmental contexts. The major aim of the present study was to establish an experimental environment that would allow analyzing the risk-taking behavior of 2 competing invasive goby species. Neogobius melanostomus was more active in the absence of a predator Sander lucioperca than N. fluviatilis and clearly spent more time ""swimming"" and ""feeding"" than N. fluviatilis. In addition, N. melanostomus was always faster than N. fluviatilis both when leaving the shelter and reaching offered food. Based on the different behaviors recorded, species-specific boldness scores were established using a principal component analysis. Although there was no overall difference in boldness scores between the 2 species, both competitive conditions and the effect of the predator played significant roles as factors influencing boldness. Neogobius melanostomus was more affected by the presence/absence of the predator than the social circumstances. Neogobius fluviatilis, on the other hand, was more active and bolder in competitive situations. However, when alone, N. fluviatilis was rather inactive and displayed altogether shy behavior, independent of the presence/absence of the predator. Thus, the study confirms the prediction that there are differences in behavior and behavioral plasticity, and therein predator-avoidance strategies, between ecologically similar species of goby living in sympatry.

"Lopes, SD",2017,Competition analysis using neighborhood models: implications for plant community assembly rules,ETHNOBIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Contemporary studies in plant ecology have investigated the processes and patterns underlying plant community of structure and dynamics, mainly in tropical forests. In this context, the effects of competitive interactions between trees and their neighbors on tree growth and survival in plant communities have been addressed using neighborhood models. The purpose of these efforts has been to better understand the processes that drive patterns of species abundance, which has the potential to change our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors involved in ecosystem dynamics. Therefore, studies concerning the competitive mechanisms that explain neighborhood interactions of plants are the subject of this short review. Two main ecological theories have received strong support in this regard: 1) environmental filtering and 2) niche complementarity. These theories are mutually compatible and act simultaneously, however, their relative importance may change depending on resource availability, type of plant community and successional stage.",10.15451/ec2017-07-6.11-1-6,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,,
"Loranger, J; Munoz, F; Shipley, B; Violle, C",2018,What makes trait-abundance relationships when both environmental filtering and stochastic neutral dynamics are at play?,OIKOS,"A major objective in ecology is to determine how local species abundances relate to their functional trait values (i.e. trait-abundance relationship), under a combined influence of 1) environmental filters affecting local species performance conditionally to trait values, 2) neutral demographic and immigration dynamics affecting abundances independently from these trait values, and 3) varying availability and frequency of species at regional level. We examined the nature and strength of the trait-abundance relationship in 30 000 simulated communities covering a gradient of the relative importance of niche-based environmental filtering and neutral stochastic processes, with heterogeneous regional species frequencies. We explored scenarios of directional, stabilizing and disruptive filtering differently affecting the success of species in communities, depending on their relative trait values. We evaluated how the four first moments of the trait distribution in a local community (i.e. abundance-weighted mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) were influenced by immigration, environmental filtering and neutral dynamics. Then we determined whether including constraints related to these moments in a Bayesian maximum entropy regression improved the prediction of the trait-abundance relationships. First, we found pervasive influence of regional frequencies on local species abundances, related to regular input of immigrants. Second, the first four moments of the local trait distribution were affected by environmental filtering, the shape of the response depending on the type of filtering. Third, with decreasing immigration rate, the imprint of local demographic stochasticity overrode the impact of environmental filtering on trait-abundance relationships. Lastly, accounting for the mean and variance of local trait distribution appeared sufficient to explain the trait-abundance relationships in our regression framework, although their contribution differed depending on the type of environmental filtering. Therefore, the mean and variance of trait values in communities, two pillars of trait-gradient analyses in functional ecology, can capture the key influence of environmental filtering on local trait-abundance relationships.",10.1111/oik.05398,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,not actually real traits,

According to the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis (DEH), plant species richness is locally controlled by productivity and disturbance. Given that regional conditions widely affect local environmental variables such as soil nutrient availability, the DEH predictions could be improved by considering how climate influences local controls of species richness. Further, a trait-based approach to community assembly has the potential to reveal a deeper, mechanistic understanding of species richness variation across environments. Here, we bring together DEH and trait-based community assembly expectations to examine whether and how local relationships between diversity, disturbance and productivity are affected by habitat filtering and regional climate.2. We specifically tested how gradients of local nutrient availability and disturbance intensity interact with climatic conditions to drive the species richness of grassland communities. Further, we recast the DEH through a functional lens by exploring how disturbance-diversity and nutrient availability-diversity relationships are shaped by the functional space occupied by species in a community and species packing within this functional space.3. The functional space occupied by co-occurring species and the way they are functionally packed are quantified using multi-trait indices calculated with five core plant functional traits. Working with grassland communities spread across differing regional climatic conditions, we used mixed models to test whether the variation in taxonomic and functional metrics corresponded to the DEH predictions as well as to determine the relationship between those metrics.4. Contrary to the expectations based on the relation between species richness and the functional components considered, taxonomic and functional metrics did not vary in accordance along environmental gradients. Climate strongly interacted with the local environment to modulate local diversity patterns, sometimes even inversing a given trend and falsifying the DEH predictions.5. Synthesis. Our findings quantitatively highlight the interplay between regional and local environmental gradients in driving community assembly. We demonstrate that, depending on climatic conditions, observed patterns of both taxonomic and functional community composition can be opposite to expected productivity-diversity and disturbance-diversity relationships.

I use comparative analyses and population modeling to explore the respective roles in regulation, and the interactions between density-dependent processes in pre- and postrecruit phases of the life cycle. Of 16 study populations, 14 show significant density dependence and therefore regulation in either (9) or both (5) phases. When standardized by habitat area, the density-dependent parameters of both phases are correlated, but the density-dependent growth parameter is a better predictor of average biomass density than the equivalent parameter of the spawner-recruit relationship. Population modeling shows that, in the absence of exploitation (i.e., near carrying capacity), 11 of the 16 populations respond most strongly to relaxation of prerecruit density dependence, whereas 5 respond most strongly to relaxation of density-dependence in postrecruit growth. Growth regulation is less important when population density is reduced below carrying capacity. Fishing erodes compensatory reserve in the recruited phase by truncating the age and size distribution. The spawner-recruit relationship therefore dominates compensation in heavily exploited populations. Growth-mediated regulation in the recruited phase is likely to be important when populations are closer to carrying capacity and therefore particularly relevant to the assessment of harvest reserves, stock rebuilding measures, and fisheries enhancements.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We propose a new approach that combines spatial ecology, network theory and trait-based ecology to examine the assembly of plant-plant associations at the community level. Location Gemmipass, Swiss Alps. Methods We fully mapped an alpine plant community at the individual plant level, recording both plant coordinates and functional traits for each individual. We identified non-random species associations using spatial point-pattern analysis and partialled out the effect of abiotic heterogeneity. We then analysed the plant network structure and used plant traits to predict species associations. Results We identified 36 significant spatial associations between plant species, 34 positive and two negatives. Dominant, stress-tolerant species such as Dryas octopetala, Linaria alpina and Leontodon montanus were highly connected in the network, whereas rare, water- and nutrient-demanding species such as Saxifraga aizoides, Galium anisophyllon and Thymus praecox were less connected compared to random expectation. The plant network was clustered, meaning that species were overall more connected among each other than expected by chance.

However, successional changes of plant and insect communities have been mainly analysed separately. Therefore, changes in plant-insect interactions along successional gradients on glacier forelands remain unknown, despite their relevance to ecosystem functioning. This study assessed how successional changes of the vegetation influenced the composition of the flower-visiting insect assemblages of two plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) Heyw. and Saxifraga bryoides L., selected as the only two insect-pollinated species occurring along the whole succession. In addition, we investigated the links between reproductive output of these plants and pollinator abundance through experimental exclusion of pollinators. Plant community structure changed along the succession, affecting the distribution and the abundance of insects via idiosyncratic responses of different insect functional groups. L. alpina interacted with ubiquitously distributed pollinators, while S. bryoides pollinators were positively associated with insect-pollinated plant species density and S. bryoides abundance. With succession proceeding, insect assemblages became more functionally diverse, with the abundance of parasitoids, predators and opportunists positively related to an increase in plant cover and diversity. The reproductive output of both plant species varied among successional stages. Contrary to our expectation, the obligate insect-pollinated L. alpina showed a reproductive output rather independent from pollinator abundance, while the reproductive output of the self-fertile S. bryoides seemed linked to pollinator abundance. Observing ecological interactions and using functional traits, we provided a mechanistic understanding of community assembly processes along a successional gradient. Plant community diversity and cover likely influenced insect community assembly through bottom-up effects. In turn, pollinators regulate plant reproductive output through top-down control.

Are these traits independent of phylogenetic relationships between species? Location Czech Republic. Methods The relative importance of biological, ecological and distributional traits of native species was studied, using a dataset of 75 species growing in rock and wall habitats in the Czech Republic. Species preferences for individual habitats due to climatic conditions and proportions of different vegetation types in their surroundings were partialled out using partial canonical correspondence analysis. The pattern of plant traits along a gradient from natural rock habitats to secondary wall habitats was analysed using regression trees and generalized linear models with and without phylogenetic correction. Results The most common native species colonising rock habitats are phanerophytes, mostly woody juveniles, with a CSR life strategy and most are adapted to epizoochory. Summer green leaves, annual life span, CR life strategy, reproduction mostly by seeds and dispersal by ants are all traits positively associated with the ability of species to colonise wall habitats. These species are also characterised by their high demand for nutrients, temperature, base-rich substrates and light. Biological and ecological traits are more important for colonising new habitats than traits related to species dispersal ability or phylogenetic relationships between species.

To test the predictions of the Growth Rate Hypothesis, we assessed the elemental composition and RNA of four phyla of common, co-occurring benthic coral reef organisms, corals, and green, brown and red macroalgae, whose patterns of dominance are predicted to be strongly influenced by differences in growth and herbivory and thus elemental stoichiometry. We assessed the importance of phylogeny and functional form, two important attributes for predicting the composition of macroalgal communities, on the variation in elemental composition. Over these widely divergent taxonomic groups of organisms, we found support for links between elemental composition and RNA in tissues. The RNA:DNA in corals was positively correlated with % nitrogen (N) and negatively correlated with carbon (C):N ratios of tissues while RNA:DNA and RNA concentrations in macroalgae were positively correlated with %N, N:P ratios and negatively correlated with C:N ratios. Corals had higher concentrations of P and lower C:P ratios than macroalgae. Among the macroalgal lineages, C:P was higher in the brown algae than in red and green algae. Overall, the variation in elemental composition of macroalgae was relatively low compared with the variation reported for terrestrial plants and similar to that in corals. Analysis of phylogenetic sources of variation (family and genus) in elemental composition and RNA found that genus accounted for a significant proportion of variation in both corals and macroalgae (15-47%), but the largest source of variation (50-97%) was unexplained by our statistical model and thus likely attributable to species and environmental factors. Although elemental composition of macroalgae did not vary in a way that was consistent with functional form models, genera with larger thalli had higher tissue N than smaller forms and more lineages with greater complexity of form had lower C:P ratios than less complex brown algal lineages. Our data indicate that the despite relatively low levels of variation in elemental composition compared with terrestrial organisms, elemental stoichiometry varied significantly among coral reef taxa and with the structure of organisms and thus may have potential for predicting variation in growth rates and patterns of consumption on coral reefs.",10.1111/1365-2435.12256,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

They are theoretically well grounded and widely used in the literature, but have always been difficult to interpret due to an apparent lack of strict relations with node and link weight. We generated several sets of 10,000 networks in order to explore such relations and work towards a sounder interpretation. The indices we explored are based on network composition (i.e., type and importance of network compartments), or network flows (i.e., type and importance of flows among compartments), including Structural Information (SI), Total System Throughput (TST), Average Mutual Information (AMI), Flow Diversity (H), and Ascendency (ASC). A correlation analysis revealed a lack of strict relationships among the responses of the investigated indicators within the simulated space of variability of the networks. However, fairly coherent patterns of response were revealed when networks were sorted by following a ""bottom-up"" criterion, i.e. by increasing the dominance of the large-sized top predator in the network. This ranking is reminiscent of ecosystem succession, along which the prominence of higher trophic level organisms progressively increases. In particular, the results show that a simple increase in organisms having large size and low consumption rates is potentially able to simultaneously lead to an increase of different types of information (as SI, H and AMI), thus also emphasizing the importance of bionomic traits related to body size in affecting information-related properties in a trophically connected community. The observed trends suffer from a certain dispersion of data, which was diminished by imposing specific and ecologically meaningful constraints, such as mass balancing and restriction to certain range of the ratio A/C, an index related to the viability of ecological networks. These results suggest that the identification of a set of effective constraints may help to identify improved conditions for applicability of the investigated flow-based indicators, and also provide indication on how to normalise them with respect to meaningful network properties or reference states. Thus, in order to increase confidence in the derived network metrics describing a particular ecosystem state, and thus increase their applicability, it is advisable to construct replicate networks by taking the variability of input data into account, and by applying uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.

The difficulty mainly arises because natural classification patterns are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

In this paper, we present an application of discriminant analysis by creating classification models from life history and morphological data for two specialist and two generalist life-styles type of predaceous phytoseiid mites. Two stages can be distinguished in our method: life-style group membership assignment and trait variable evaluation. We use a Bayesian framework to create a classifier system to locate or assign species within a mixture of trait distributions. The method assumes that a mixture of trait distributions can represent the multiple dimensions of biological data. The mixture is most evident near the boundaries between groups. Because of the complexity of analytical solution, an iterative method is used to estimate the unknown means, variances, and mixing proportion between groups. We also developed a criterion based on information theory to evaluate model performance with different combinations of input variables and different hypotheses.

Identifying the species-level traits associated with this behaviour would aid in understanding and predicting a species' capacity for dispersal between isolated areas of benthic habitat. Location The tropical and subtropical Atlantic. Methods We assessed the relationships between species-level traits (habitat use, position in water column, diet, body size, schooling activity) and rafting behaviour among 985 species of reef fish using generalized linear mixed-effect modelling. To assess whether the relationships between rafting behaviour and species traits were mediated by raft type, our analysis included interactions between raft type and our predictor variables. Results The following species-level traits are positively associated with rafting for reef fishes: (1) position in water column above reef substratum, which indicates a species' dependency on the substratum; (2) schooling behaviour, a trait linked to predation avoidance; (3) large adult size, which may be associated with enhanced survivorship and growth of rafting juveniles; and (4) broad habitat use, which may facilitate use of atypical habitats, including flotsam. Some correlations varied depending on the type of flotsam - broad habitat use is only positively correlated with the use of seaweed rafts, which may resemble patches of benthic macroalgal and seagrass beds that the reef fishes often use as ancillary habitat. In contrast, schooling behaviour is only positively correlated with rafting among logs and similar objects, perhaps because they represent poor refuges from predation. Main conclusions A species' propensity to use rafts is associated with specific ecological traits, some of which are contingent on characteristics of the raft. Thus, our findings suggest that increasing amounts of man-made flotsam entering the ocean may differentially influence future rafting opportunities among tropical reef fishes, depending on their traits, which may have important implications for their biogeographical distributions.",10.1111/jbi.12574,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Marine,Fish,Coral Reef,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = using rafts, type of raft habitat generalization, water column position, diet type, max body size, schooling behaviour",

However, the extent to which these mechanisms differ in importance based on traits of taxa with different niche breadth is poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative importance of environmental selection and stochastic processes in shaping soil bacterial sub-communities with different niche breadth (including habitat generalists, specialists and other taxa) across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai, Northern China. Our findings suggested that the composition of soil bacterial communities differed significantly different among elevational gradients. According to the niche breadth index, 10.9% of OTUs were defined as habitat generalists (B-value >8.7) and 10.0% of OTUs were defined as habitat specialists (B-value <1.5). Generalists and specialists differed distinctly in diversity and biogeographic patterns across elevational gradients. Environmental selection (deterministic processes) and spatial factors (stochastic processes) seemed to determine the assembly and biogeography of habitat generalists. However, for specialists, deterministic processes strongly influenced the distribution, while stochastic processes were not at play. Environmental drivers for generalists and specialists differed, as did their importance. Elevation, total nitrogen and pH were the main factors determining habitat generalists, and soil water content, nitrate nitrogen and pH had the strongest impacts on specialists. Moreover, variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental selection had a much greater impact on both generalists (17.7% of pure variance was explained) and specialists (3.6%) than spatial factors. However, generalists had a much stronger response to spatial factors (2.3%) than specialists (0.3%). More importantly, null models of s-diversity suggested that specialists deviated significantly from non-neutral assembly mechanisms (relative null deviation= 0.64-0.74) relative to generalists (0.16-0.65) (P < 0.05). These results indicate that generalists and specialists are governed by different assembly mechanisms and present distinct biogeographical patterns. The large proportion of unexplained variation in specialists (93.3%) implies that very complex assembly mechanisms exist in the assembly of specialists across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai.

By using only parasite species richness as their measure of diversity, however, previous investigations have ignored the relatedness among parasite species and the taxonomic structure of the assemblages, which contain much information about their evolutionary origins. Here, we performed a comparative analysis across 50 species of fish from the coast of Brazil; we evaluated the effects of several host traits (body size, social behaviour, feeding habits, preference for benthic vs. pelagic habitats, depth range, and ability to enter brackish waters) on the diversity of their assemblages of metazoan parasites. As measures of diversity, we used parasite species richness, as well as the average taxonomic distinctness of the assemblage and its variance; the latter measures are based on the average taxonomic distance between any two parasite species in an assemblage. Unlike parasite species richness, taxonomic distinctness,vas unaffected by the number of host individuals examined per species. Fish body length proved to be the main predictor of parasite species richness, even when controlling for the confounding influences of host phylogeny and sampling effort, although it did not correlate with measures of parasite taxonomic distinctness. Predatory fish also had higher parasite species richness than planktivores, but this trend could not be confirmed using phylogenetically independent contrasts between host taxa. The main host feature associated with the taxonomic diversity of parasites was schooling behaviour, with schooling fish having more taxonomically diverse parasite assemblages than those of their non-schooling relatives. When focusing on endoparasite species only, both predatory feeding habits and a broad depth range were associated with the taxonomic distinctness of parasites. Our results suggest that certain host traits (i.e. body size) determine how many parasite species a host can accumulate over evolutionary time, whereas different host features influence the processes causing the taxonomic diversification of parasite assemblages.",10.1017/S0031182004005050,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,1,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,1,1,1,"traits = body size, social behaviour, feeding habits, preference for benthic vs. pelagic habitats, depth range, and ability to enter brackish waters. flagging as a parasite one, ugh.

In the classical attempt to undetstand the processes supporting biodiversity, ecologists are currently seeking to unravel the differential roles of environmental filtering and competition for resources in niche partitioning processes: these processes are in principle distinct although they may act simultaneously, interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and are often confounded in studies of soil communities. We used a novel combination of methods based on stable isotopes and trait analysis to resolve these processes in diverse oribatid mite assemblages at spatial scales at which competition for resources could in principle be a major driver. We also used a null model approach based on a general neutral model of beta diversity. A large and significant fraction of community variation was explainable in terms of linear and periodic spatial structures in the distribution of organic C, N and soil structure: species were clearly arranged along an environmental, spatially structured gradient. However, competition related trait differences did not map onto the distances separating species along the environmental gradient and neutral models provided a satisfying approximation of beta diversity patterns. The results represent the first robust evidence that in very diverse soil arthropod assemblages resource-based niche partitioning plays a minor role while environmental filtering remains a fundamental driver of species distribution.

Marine predators require particularly sophisticated foraging strategies that enable them to balance self-and off-spring-feeding, and also in many circumstances simultaneously consider the nutritional constraints of their partners. Here we combined the use of dietary analysis, proximate composition and nutritional geometry (right-angled mixture triangle nutritional models) to examine the macronutrient preferences of Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) at Farewell Spit gannetry in New Zealand. Our results showed intra-and inter-specific variation in the protein, lipid and water composition of prey captured by our sample of 111 Australasian gannets. In addition, we observed significant differences in the Australasian gannets' nutritional niche between seasons. We provide evidence of sex-specific macronutrient foraging strategies in a successful marine predator in the wild. We have shown that in spite of fluctuations in the nutritional composition of foods available to Australasian gannets, males consistently capture prey with higher protein-to-lipid ratios and lower lipid-to-water ratios than females. These results aid to better understand the evolutionary relationship between macronutrient selection and sex-specific traits in wild animals. They also suggest an incentive for these predators to combine individually imbalanced but nutritionally complementary foods to achieve dietary balance, further highlighting the likelihood that prey selection is guided by the balance of macronutrients, rather than energy alone.",10.1007/s00227-016-2841-y,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"MacLean, SA; Beissinger, SR",2017,Species' traits as predictors of range shifts under contemporary climate change: A review and meta-analysis,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"A growing body of literature seeks to explain variation in range shifts using species' ecological and life-history traits, with expectations that shifts should be greater in species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive potential, and ecological generalization. Despite strong theoretical support for species' traits as predictors of range shifts, empirical evidence from contemporary range shift studies remains limited in extent and consensus. We conducted the first comprehensive review of species' traits as predictors of range shifts, collecting results from 51 studies across multiple taxa encompassing over 11,000 species' responses for 54 assemblages of taxonomically related species occurring together in space. We used studies of assemblages that directly compared geographic distributions sampled in the 20th century prior to climate change with resurveys of distributions after contemporary climate change and then tested whether species traits accounted for heterogeneity in range shifts. We performed a formal meta-analysis on study-level effects of body size, fecundity, diet breadth, habitat breadth, and historic range limit as predictors of range shifts for a subset of 21 studies of 26 assemblages with sufficient data. Range shifts were consistent with predictions based on habitat breadth and historic range limit. However, body size, fecundity, and diet breadth showed no significant effect on range shifts across studies, and multiple studies reported significant relationships that contradicted predictions.

Line 1 was founded largely from two paternal half-sib sires and has been selected for postweaning growth. There were pedigree records on 951 members of the base population that predated 1935, when data collection began. Numbers of records analyzed using mixed-model methodology were 4,716 birth weight, 4,427 preweaning ADG, and 3,579 postweaning ADG. Birth weight and preweaning ADG were considered to have direct and maternal genetic components. Inbreeding accumulated rapidly from 1935 to 1960 and more slowly (.22%/yr) thereafter. Any reduction in additive genetic variance due to inbreeding and selection may have been offset by a concurrent reduction in generation interval that was observed as time progressed. Expected selection differential for 365-d weight, averaged over sexes, was 31.2 kg per generation. For birth weight, annual genetic trends in direct and maternal effects were 42 +/- 3 g and 15 +/- 3 g, respectively. Annual direct and maternal genetic trends for preweaning ADG were .70 +/- .06 g/d and .63 +/- .06 g/d, respectively. Direct response in postweaning ADG was linear and equal to 5.3 +/- .6 g.d-1.yr-1. As a result, estimated breeding values of birth weight, 200-d weight, and 365-d weight increased by 3.2 kg, 14.5 kg, and 62.4 kg, respectively, from 1935 to 1989.

Combined use of environmental data with morphological and genomic data should allow us to understand the extent to which patterns of phenotypic and genetic diversity within a species can be explained by the structure of the environment. Here, we analyse the variation of populations of three-spined stickleback from 27 freshwater lakes on North Uist, Scotland, that vary greatly in their environment, to understand how environmental and genetic constraints contribute to phenotypic divergence. We collected 35 individuals per population and 30 abiotic and biotic environmental parameters to characterize variation across lakes and analyse phenotype-environment associations. Additionally, we used RAD sequencing to estimate the genetic relationships among a subset of these populations. We found a large amount of phenotypic variation among populations, most prominently in armour and spine traits. Despite large variation in the abiotic environment, namely in ion composition, depth and dissolved organic Carbon, more phenotypic variation was explained by the biotic variables (presence of predators and density of predator and competitors), than by associated abiotic variables. Genetic structure among populations was partly geographic, with closer populations being more similar. Altogether, our results suggest that differences in body shape among stickleback populations are the result of both canalized genetic and plastic responses to environmental factors, which shape fish morphology in a predictable direction regardless of their genetic starting point.",10.1111/mec.13746,Y,0,1,1,0,0,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,Lake,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = standard length, weight, body shape, number of armour plates, ",
"Maglianesi, MA; Bluthgen, N; Bohning-Gaese, K; Schleuning, M",2014,Morphological traits determine specialization and resource use in plant-hummingbird networks in the neotropics,ECOLOGY,"Ecological communities are organized in complex ecological networks. Trait-based analyses of the structure of these networks in highly diversified species assemblages are crucial for improving our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes causing specialization in mutualistic networks. In this study, we assessed the importance of morphological traits for structuring plant-hummingbird networks in Neotropical forests by using a novel combination of quantitative analytical approaches. We recorded the visitation of hummingbirds to plant species over an entire year at three different elevations in Costa Rica and constructed quantitative networks based on interaction frequencies. Three morphological traits were measured in hummingbirds (bill length, bill curvature, and body mass) and plants (corolla length, curvature, and volume). We tested the effects of avian morphological traits and abundance on ecological specialization of hummingbird species. All three morphological traits of hummingbirds were positively associated with ecological specialization, especially bill curvature. We tested whether interaction strength in the networks was associated with the degree of trait matching between corresponding pairs of morphological traits in plant and hummingbird species and explore whether this was related to resource handling times by hummingbird species. We found strong and significant associations between interaction strength and the degree of trait matching. Moreover, the degree of trait matching, particularly between bill and corolla length, was associated with the handling time of nectar resources by hummingbirds. Our findings show that bill morphology structures tropical plant-hummingbird networks and patterns of interactions are closely associated with morphological matches between plant and bird species and the efficiency of hummingbirds' resource use. These results are consistent with the findings of seminal studies in plant-hummingbird systems from the neotropics. We conclude that trait-based analyses of quantitative networks contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of the causes of specialization in ecological networks and could be valuable for studying processes of complementary trait evolution in highly diversified species assemblages.",10.1890/13-2261.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Multiple,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,0,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"triats = birds (bill length, bull curavture, body mass), plants (corolla length, curvature, volume)",

However, feasibility and applicability of functional groups in ecosystems across very different climatic regions have not yet been studied. In our approach we specified the functional groups in sand dune ecosystems of the Mediterranean, Hyrcanian and Irano-Turanian phytogeographic regions. We examined whether functional groups are more influenced by region or rather by habitat characteristics, and identified trait syndromes associated with common habitat types in sand dunes (mobile dunes, stabilized dunes, salt marshes, semi-wet sands, disturbed habitats). A database of 14 traits, 309 species and 314 releves was examined and trait-species, trait-plot and species-plot matrices were built. Cluster analysis revealed similar plant functional groups in sand dune ecosystems across regions of very different species composition and climate. Specifically, our study showed that plant traits in sand dune ecosystems are grouped reflecting habitat affiliation rather than region and species pool. Environmental factors and constraints such as sand mobility, soil salinity, water availability, nutrient status and disturbance are more important for the occurrence and distribution of plant functional groups than regional belonging. Each habitat is shown to be equipped with specific functional groups and can be described by specific sets of traits. In restoration ecology the completeness of functional groups and traits in a site may serve as a guideline for maintaining or restoring the habitat. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"Majdi, N; Boiche, A; Traunspurger, W; Lecerf, A",2014,Predator effects on a detritus-based food web are primarily mediated by non-trophic interactions,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"Predator effects on ecosystems can extend far beyond their prey and are often not solely lethally transmitted. Change in prey traits in response to predation risk can have important repercussions on community assembly and key ecosystem processes (i.e. trait-mediated indirect effects). In addition, some predators themselves alter habitat structure or nutrient cycling through ecological engineering effects. Tracking these non-trophic pathways is thus an important, yet challenging task to gain a better grasp of the functional role of predators. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, in detritus-based food webs, non-trophic interactions may prevail over purely trophic interactions in determining predator effects on plant litter decomposition. This hypothesis was tested in a headwater stream by modulating the density of a flatworm predator (Polycelis felina) in enclosures containing oak (Quercus robur) leaf litter exposed to natural colonization by small invertebrates and microbial decomposers. Causal path modelling was used to infer how predator effects propagated through the food web. Flatworms accelerated litter decomposition through positive effects on microbial decomposers. The biomass of prey and non-prey invertebrates was not negatively affected by flatworms, suggesting that net predator effect on litter decomposition was primarily determined by non-trophic interactions. Flatworms enhanced the deposition and retention of fine sediments on leaf surface, thereby improving leaf colonization by invertebrates - most of which having strong affinities with interstitial habitats. This predator-induced improvement of habitat availability was attributed to the sticky nature of the mucus that flatworms secrete in copious amount while foraging. Results of path analyses further indicated that this bottom-up ecological engineering effect was as powerful as the top-down effect on invertebrate prey. Our findings suggest that predators have the potential to affect substantially carbon flow and nutrient cycling in detritus-based ecosystems and that this impact cannot be fully appreciated without considering non-trophic effects.",10.1111/1365-2656.12189,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Mallatt, J; Chen, JY",2003,Fossil sister group of craniates: Predicted and found,JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY,"This study investigates whether the recently described Cambrian fossil Haikouella (and the very similar Yunnanozoon) throws light on the longstanding problem of the origin of craniates. In the first rigorous cladistic analysis of the relations of this animal, we took 40 anatomical characters from Haikouella and other taxa (hemichordates, tunicates, cephalochordates, conodont craniates and other craniates, plus protostomes as the outgroup) and subjected these characters to parsimony analysis. The characters included several previously unrecognized traits of Haikouella, such as upper lips resembling those of larval lampreys, the thick nature of the branchial bars, a mandibular branchial artery but no mandibular branchial bar, muscle fibers defining the myomeres, a dark fibrous sheath that defines the notochord, conclusive evidence for paired eyes, and a large hindbrain and diencephalon in the same positions as in the craniate brain. The cladistic analysis produced this tree: (protostomes, hemichordates (tunicates, (cephalochordates, (Haikouella, (conodonts + other craniates))))), with the ""Haikouella + craniate"" clade supported by bootstrap values that ranged from 81-96%, depending on how the analysis was structured. Thus, Haikouella is concluded to be the sister group of the craniates. Alternate hypotheses that unite Haikouella with hemichordates or cephalochordates, or consider it a basal deuterostome, received little or no support. Although it is the sister group of craniates, Haikouella is skull-less and lacks an ear, but it does have neural-crest derivatives in its branchial bars. Its craniate characters occur mostly in the head and pharynx; its widely spaced, robust branchial bars indicate it ventilated with branchiomeric muscles, not cilia. Despite its craniate mode of ventilation, Haikouella was not a predator but a suspension feeder, as shown by its cephalochordate-like endostyle, and tentacles forming a screen across the mouth. Haikouella was compared to pre-craniates predicted by recent models of craniate evolution and was found to fit these predictions closely. Specifically, it fits Northcutt and Gans' prediction that the change from ciliary to muscular ventilation preceded the change from suspension feeding to predatory feeding; it fits Butler's claim that vision was the first craniate sense to start elaborating; it is consistent with the ideas of Donoghue and others about the ancestor of conodont craniates; and, most strikingly, it resembles Mallatt's prediction of the external appearance of the ancestral craniate head. By contrast, Haikouella does not fit the widespread belief that ancestral craniates resembled hagfishes, because it has no special hagfish characters. Overall, Haikouella agrees so closely with recent predictions about precraniates that we conclude that the difficult problem of craniate origins is nearly solved.

However, comparative approaches within the Poaceae permit transfer of molecular knowledge between species, despite their divergence from a common ancestor sixty million years ago. The finding that null variants of the rice gene cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 2 (OsCKX2) result in large yield increases provides an opportunity to explore whether similar gains could be achieved in other Poaceae members. Here, phylogenetic, molecular and comparative analyses of CKX families in the sequenced grass species rice, brachypodium, sorghum, maize and foxtail millet, as well as members identified from the transcriptomes/genomes of wheat and barley, are presented. Phylogenetic analyses define four Poaceae CKX clades. Comparative analyses showed that CKX phylogenetic groupings can largely be explained by a combination of local gene duplication, and the whole-genome duplication event that predates their speciation. Full-length OsCKX2 homologues in barley (HvCKX2.1, HvCKX2.2) and wheat (TaCKX2.3, TaCKX2.4, TaCKX2.5) are characterized, with comparative analysis at the DNA, protein and genetic/physical map levels suggesting that true CKX2 orthologs have been identified. Furthermore, our analysis shows CKX2 genes in barley and wheat have undergone a Triticeae-specific gene-duplication event. Finally, by identifying ten of the eleven CKX genes predicted to be present in barley by comparative analyses, we show that next-generation sequencing approaches can efficiently determine the gene space of large-genome crops.

"Mammides, C; Chen, J; Goodale, UM; Kotagama, SW; Goodale, E",2018,Measurement of species associations in mixed-species bird flocks across environmental and human disturbance gradients,ECOSPHERE,"In a changing world, it is important to understand how species interactions, such as those among species in mixed-species animal groups, are impacted by human activity. New techniques for measuring associations, in particular social networks and null simulations, have been applied to mixed-species group analyses. Unanswered questions include: (1) How do these methods compare to each other and to the traditional frequency table approach? (2) How similar are associations for the same pair of species in different habitats, such those with different disturbance histories or at different altitudes? (3) What traits of species influence these association strengths? Using data from an intensive study of mixed-species bird flocks in Sri Lanka, we used Mantel tests to compare associations calculated through three methods: the phi coefficient, social networks, and null simulations. Results from the three methods varied (0.53 < r < 0.75), but converged when out-of-flock data were added to the phi coefficient and social network methods (0.75 < r < 0.94). Correlations between the associations in different habitats were uniformly low (all <0.50) across all methods. These results, when combined with the fact that only a small percentage of the associations were statistically significant (9-14%, depending on the method used), suggest that on average, birds may not have strong preferences for other species in flocks. The trait analysis, conducted using the Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure found that species that are more similar to each other in their body mass and diet had higher association strengths. This result was similar to what has been found before in global meta-analyses; however, contrary to earlier reports, in this study association strength increased with increasing phylogenetic distance. The strength of these results decreased when non-statistically significant species associations were included in these analyses or out-of-flock data were excluded, again emphasizing that the method of calculating species associations can influence conclusions. Nevertheless, it is dear that species associations in avian mixed-species groups are not greatly consistent across natural or anthropogenic gradients, although they are influenced to a certain extent by similarities in species traits, especially for species that show statistically significant associations.",10.1002/ecs2.2324,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Birds,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,0,0,1,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body mass, diet",

A wide range of models is already available for this type of analysis, and the field is still under active development. One of the most needed development concerns models that better account for the effect of within-and between-clade interspecific interactions on trait evolution, which can result from processes as diverse as competition, predation, parasitism, or mutualism. Here, we begin by developing a very general comparative phylogenetic framework for (multi)-trait evolution that can be applied to both ultrametric and nonultrametric trees. This framework not only encapsulates many previous models of continuous univariate and multivariate phenotypic evolution, but also paves the way for the consideration of a much broader series of models in which lineages coevolve, meaning that trait changes in one lineage are influenced by the value of traits in other, interacting lineages. Next, we provide a standard way for deriving the probabilistic distribution of traits at tip branches under our framework. We show that a multivariate normal distribution remains the expected distribution for a broad class of models accounting for interspecific interactions. Our derivations allow us to fit various models efficiently, and in particular greatly reduce the computation time needed to fit the recently proposed phenotype matching model. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our framework by developing a toy model for mutualistic coevolution. Our framework should foster a new era in the study of coevolution from comparative data.",10.1093/sysbio/syw115,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here, we use fish feeding behaviour, a biological trait easily impaired by trawling disturbance, to depict alterations in fish condition (i.e. individual fitness) and feeding opportunities. The benthivorous fish Mullus barbatus barbatus was selected as a model species. The observed trends of responses to trawling in prey species confirmed the effectiveness of a non-trawled zone in sustaining higher levels of diet diversity (e.g. quantity and quality of ingested prey) and fish condition values (e.g. morphometric and physiological Condition Index). Changes observed in fish prey selection confirmed the role of trawling disturbance in modifying the local soft bottoms community, producing alterations of prey availability that trigger shifts in fish diet. Trawling-induced feeding patterns, mirrored through stomach contents, can positively or negatively affect fish condition, the main driver of population dynamics in maintaining carrying capacity levels. Due to the widespread socio-economic value of the red mullet fishery, and the current exploitation status, evidence gathered by the proposed bottom-up trait based approach might inform future trawling adaptation strategies, and tailor spatial conservation measures supporting an Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management.

The analyses of functional and phylogenetic diversity support the idea that alien species significantly affect the functional and phylogenetic characteristics of the native plant communities. Habitat filtering seems to be predominant in not-invaded plots, whereas limiting similarity/niche differentiation is predominant in driving community assembly of invaded communities. The attained scenario depicts the spread of a reduced group of alien species phylogenetically and functionally well-differentiated, able to reduce the abundance of native species, not to exclude them though.

As ecological succession can represent community assembly in action, understanding how successional time affects the functional and phylogenetic structure of communities can reveal the influence of different factors on the assembly process. We analysed functional patterns of multiple traits related to the succession of tropical forests to answer if there are trait convergence and/or divergence with regeneration age, and if functional and phylogenetic diversity can be predicted by forest age. We compiled checklists from studies of 23 successional forests in Brazilian Atlantic Forest, ranging from 4 to 120 years old. We also compiled functional traits for a total of 355 species. We analysed the data by a method that includes scaling-up trait-based data to the community level and matrix correlations of multiple traits. We built linear models to show the relationship between each trait and diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) with successional time. We found no phylogenetic signal at the species pool and metacommunity levels, but significant trait divergence (tree guild, leaf slenderness, leaf area, pollination entomo-philous generalist and pollination by vertebrate) and trait convergence (arboreal habitus, tree guild, leaf compoundness, pollination entomophilous generalist) patterns related to the successional gradient. Also, functional diversity increased during succession, with a significant increase in leaf slenderness and zoochoric dispersal and decrease in tree guild. Phylogenetic diversity also increased along the successional gradient. We found that the communities in the studied successional gradient are structured by both environmental (measured by trait convergence) and biotic (measured by trait divergence) filtering.

The extent to which the fitness costs of infection are mediated by key life-history traits such as age or social status is still unclear. Within populations, individual heterogeneity in the outcome of infection is the result of two successive processes; the degree of contact with the pathogen (exposure) and the immune response to infection. In social mammals, because individuals holding high social status typically interact more frequently with group members, they should be more often in contact with infected individuals than those of low social status. However, when access to resources is determined by social status, individuals with a high social status are often better nourished, have a greater opportunity to allocate resources to immune processes and therefore should have a smaller chance of succumbing to infection than individuals with low social status. 2. We investigated the risk and fitness costs of infection during a virulent epidemic of canine distemper virus (CDV) in a social carnivore, the spotted hyena, in the Serengeti National Park. We analysed two decades of detailed life-history data from 625 females and 816 males using a multi-event capture-mark-recapture model that accounts for uncertainty in the assignment of individual infection states. 3. Cubs of mothers with a high social status had a lower probability of CDV infection and were more likely to survive infection than those with low social status. Subadult and adult females with high social status had a higher infection probability than those with low social status. Subadult females and pre-breeder males that had recovered from CDV infection had a lower survival than susceptible ones. 4. Our study disentangles the relative importance of individual exposure and resource allocation to immune processes, demonstrates fitness costs of infection for juveniles, particularly for those with low social status, shows that patterns of infection can be driven by different mechanisms among juveniles and adults and establishes a negative relationship between infection and fitness in a free-ranging mammal.",10.1111/1365-2435.13059,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Mammals,Grassland,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,1,1,1,"trait = social status.

Many of these traits operate as complexes, where multiple subsidiary parts function and evolve together. As trait complexity increases, so does the challenge of describing complexity in intuitive, biologically meaningful ways. Traditional multivariate analyses ignore the phenomenon of individual complexity and provide relatively abstract representations of variation among individuals. We suggest adopting well-known diversity indices from community ecology to describe phenotypic complexity as the diversity of distinct subsidiary components of a trait. Using a hierarchical framework, we illustrate how total trait diversity can be partitioned into within-individual complexity (alpha diversity) and between-individual components (beta diversity). This approach complements traditional multivariate analyses. The key innovations are (i) addition of individual complexity within the same framework as between-individual variation and (ii) a group-wise partitioning approach that complements traditional level-wise partitioning of diversity. The complexity-as-diversity approach has potential application in many fields, including physiological ecology, ecological and community genomics, and transcriptomics. We demonstrate the utility of this complexity-as-diversity approach with examples from chemical and microbial ecology. The examples illustrate biologically significant differences in complexity and diversity that standard analyses would not reveal.",10.1086/682369,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Marko, PB",2005,An intraspecific comparative analysis of character divergence between sympatric species,EVOLUTION,"Although sympatric character divergence between closely related species has been described in a wide variety of taxa, the evolutionary processes responsible for generating these patterns are difficult to identify. One hypothesis that can explain sympatric differences is ecological character displacement: the sympatric origin of morphologically divergent phenotypes in response to selection caused by interspecific competition. Alternatively, populations may adapt to different conditions in allopatry, with sympatric distributions evolving through selective colonization and proliferation of ecologically compatible phenotypes. In this study, I characterize geographic variation within two sibling species of rocky-shore gastropods that have partially overlapping distributions in central California. In sympatry, both Nucella emarginata and N. ostrina show significant differences in shell shape and shell ornamentation that together suggest that where the two species co-exist, divergent phenotypes arose as an evolutionary consequence of competition. To examine the evolutionary origins of divergent characters in. sympatry, I used a comparative method based on spatial autocorrelation to remove the portion of the phenotypic variance among populations that is explained by genetic distance (using mitochondrial DNA sequences and allozyme frequency data). Because the remaining portion of the phenotypic variance represents the independent divergence of individual populations, a significant sympatric difference in the corrected dataset provides evidence of true character displacement: significant sympatric character evolution that is independent of population history. After removal of genetic distance effects in Nucella, shell shape differences remain statistically significant in N. emarginata, providing evidence of significant sympatric character divergence. However, for external shell ornamentation in both species and shell shape in N. ostrina, the significance of sympatric differences is lost in the corrected dataset, indicating that colonization events and gene flow have played important roles in the evolutionary history of character divergence in sympatry. Although the absence of a widely dispersing planktonic larva in the life cycle of Nucella will promote local adaptation, the results here indicate that once advantageous traits arise, demographic processes, such as recurrent gene flow between established populations and extinction and recolonization, are important factors contributing to the geographic pattern of sympatric character divergence.",10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01015.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Marine,Other,Coast,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,0,0,1,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"taxonomic = gastropod. trait = shell shape, shell ornamentation",

Epidermal tissues from the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves and fruits of 23 species were extracted by scraping and prepared on individual microscope slides. An optical microscope with a camera lucida fixed at magnifications of x400 was used to analyse and to draw the morphological traits of epidermal tissues to the same scale. Furthermore, quantitative data for those congeneric species were also obtained by using an image analysis program system. The results indicate that this microhistological method permits the differentiation of practically all species of trees present in the Macaronesian laurel forest. Furthermore, most species belonging to the same taxa (genus or family) show a general common pattern in the morphology of the different epidermal traits. Lastly, despite the effort that constitutes the preparation of plant microhistological collections of a determined ecosystem, it is of basic importance because it makes possible the performance of feeding ecological studies of several herbivorous and frugivorous vertebrate species.

LocationSix grazed ex-arable fields and eight semi-natural grasslands in southeast Sweden. MethodsWe estimated species abundance and measured soil attributes at each site. For each species within each site we measured specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and seed mass. We analysed the data both for abundance-weighted species values and species occurrence. ResultsTrait gradient analysis indicated random distribution of species among sites, while CCA analysis indicated that both soil phosphorus and moisture were related to species assembly at a site. Correlations and fourth-corner analysis also revealed a relationship between measured species traits and soil phosphorus and moisture. There was a lower average seed mass and higher SLA of species in ex-arable fields compared to species in semi-natural grasslands. ConclusionsEven though trait gradient analysis indicated that plant community assembly in the studied grasslands was random, other results implied that species occurrence and abundance was influenced both by environmental factors and species traits.

"Marteinsdottir, B; Svavarsdottir, K; Thorhallsdottir, TE",2018,Multiple mechanisms of early plant community assembly with stochasticity driving the process,ECOLOGY,"Initial plant establishment is one of the most critical phases in ecosystem development, where an early suite of physical (environmental filtering), biological (seed limitation, species interactions) and stochastic factors may affect successional trajectories and rates. While functional traits are commonly used to study processes that influence plant community assembly in late successional communities, few studies have applied them to primary succession. The objective here was to determine the importance of these factors in shaping early plant community assembly on a glacial outwash plain, Skeioararsandur, in SE Iceland using a trait based approach. We used data on vascular plant assemblages at two different spatial scales (community and neighborhood) sampled in 2005 and 2012, and compiled a dataset on seven functional traits linked to species dispersal abilities, establishment, and persistence for all species within these assemblages. Trait-based null model analyses were used to determine the processes that influenced plant community assembly from the regional species pool into local communities, and to determine if the importance of these processes in community assembly was dependent on local environment or changed with time. On the community scale, for most traits, random processes dominated the assembly from the regional species pool. However, in some communities, there was evidence of non-random assembly in relation to traits linked to species dispersal abilities, persistence, and establishment. On the neighborhood scale, assembly was mostly random. The relative importance of different processes varied spatially and temporally and the variation was linked to local soil conditions. While stochasticity dominated assembly patterns of our early successional communities, there was evidence of both seed limitation and environmental filtering.

"Martin, Gerardo; Becker, Daniel J; Plowright, Raina K",2018,Environmental Persistence of Influenza H5N1 Is Driven by Temperature and Salinity: Insights From a Bayesian Meta-Analysis,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Environmental persistence of zoonotic pathogens is a key trait that influences the probability of zoonotic spillover. Pathogen survival outside of the host determines the window available for contact with the new recipient host species and the dose of pathogen available to that host. The longer a pathogen survives in the environment, the more disconnected the reservoir and recipient hosts can be in space and time, and the more likely that an infective dose will be available to recipient hosts. Therefore, environmental persistence is a key parameter for mechanistic models needed to predict pathogen spillover. Avian influenza can be transmitted from wildlife to poultry and people in part due to its ability to persist in the environment. Considerable work has been done to quantify trends in avian influenza persistence across environmental conditions, often published in separate studies with separate datasets. In this paper, we quantify the trends and variability of avian influenza viral persistence across environmental conditions by collating disjoint experimental data on viral particle persistence in water across many studies and a range of environmental conditions. The collated data represent 120 estimates from three different studies of the decay rates of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (90 estimates from Asia and 30 from Europe) in response to temperature, pH, and salinity. We analyzed these data with a Bayesian model to control for biases with random effects and used experimental replicates and R2 estimates of the publication's regression procedures as statistical weights. We found temperature significantly decreases persistence of H5N1 virus in water, and this effect is stronger than that of salinity alone. Salinity interacts with temperature and probably drives the most contrasting persistence scenarios between cold-saline and warm-saline water bodies, where highest and lowest persistence times could occur respectively. Our work provides needed parameters for models that examine the risk of spillover of avian influenza viruses.

"Martin, JS; Massen, JJM; Slipogor, V; Bugnyar, T; Jaeggi, AV; Koski, SE",2019,The EGA plus GNM framework: An integrative approach to modelling behavioural syndromes,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Behavioural syndromes refer to correlated suites of behavioural traits exhibiting consistent among-individual variation, i.e. personality. Factor analysis (FA) is currently the dominant method for modelling behavioural syndromes in humans and animals. Although FA is useful for inferring the latent causes underlying trait correlations, it does not account for the pairwise behavioural interactions that also contribute to syndrome structure. Given that latent factors and pairwise interactions are likely ubiquitous causes of trait covariation, both should be modelled simultaneously. Currently, however, behavioural ecologists lack an integrative framework for describing and inferring such behavioural syndromes. Generalized network modelling (GNM), representing an integration of FA and Gaussian graphical modelling (GGM), meets this challenge. We provide a theoretical introduction to GNM as well as a method for detecting latent factors in GGMs called exploratory graph analysis (EGA). We then propose the novel EGA+GNM framework for modelling multiple sources of trait correlations and ensuring more robust causal inferences. To empirically demonstrate the utility of this framework, we compare models derived from EGA+GNM and FA using observational measures of social and arousal behaviour in common marmosets Callithrix jacchus. Using information-theoretic model comparison, we find support for EGA+GNM models compared to models generated by FA. Two EGA+GNM models suggest that while latent factors contribute to the emergence of clustered sociability and arousal behaviours, correlations among these traits may also be partially explained by pairwise interactions. Additionally, these behavioural clusters are hypothesized to be causally linked by a positive pairwise interaction between allogrooming and activity level. These results support our claim that EGA+GNM provides a superior and integrative framework for describing behavioural syndromes. Consequently, by simultaneously modelling both latent factors and pairwise interactions, behavioural ecologists can better understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of animal personality. A formal overview of the EGA+GNM framework and a R tutorial demonstrating its application are provided in the electronic Supporting Information.",10.1111/2041-210X.13100,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Martin, Philip A.; Newton, Adrian C.; Bullock, James M.",2017,Impacts of invasive plants on carbon pools depend on both species' traits and local climate,ECOLOGY,"Invasive plants can alter ecosystem properties, leading to changes in the ecosystem services on which humans depend. However, generalizing about these effects is difficult because invasive plants represent a wide range of life forms, and invaded ecosystems differ in their plant communities and abiotic conditions. We hypothesize that differences in traits between the invader and native species can be used to predict impacts and so aid generalization. We further hypothesize that environmental conditions at invaded sites modify the effect of trait differences and so combine with traits to predict invasion impacts. To test these hypotheses, we used systematic review to compile data on changes in aboveground and soil carbon pools following non-native plant invasion from studies across the World. Maximum potential height (H-max) of each species was drawn from trait databases and other sources. We used meta-regression to assess which of invasive species' H-max, differences in this height trait between native and invasive plants, and climatic water deficit, a measure of water stress, were good predictors of changes in carbon pools following invasion. We found that aboveground biomass in invaded ecosystems relative to uninvaded ones increased as the value of H-max of invasive relative to native species increased, but that this effect was reduced in more water stressed ecosystems. Changes in soil carbon pools were also positively correlated with the relative H-max of invasive species, but were not altered by water stress. This study is one of the first to show quantitatively that the impact of invasive species on an ecosystem may depend on differences in invasive and native species' traits, rather than solely the traits of invasive species. Our study is also the first to show that the influence of trait differences can be altered by climate. Further developing our understanding of the impacts of invasive species using this framework could help researchers to identify not only potentially dangerous invasive species, but also the ecosystems where impacts are likely to be greatest.",10.1002/ecy.1711/suppinfo,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Except for a pair of anterior palps, all protodrilids lack appendages, parapodia and chaetae; and have slender bodies adapted to glide between the sand grains by ciliary motion. The first exception to these characteristics is Megadrilus pelagicus n. sp. inhabiting the water column of the anchialine La Corona cave system in Lanzarote. Its morphology and evolutionary history are here investigated by combining observations from invivo video recordings and advanced microscopy with phylogenetic analyses. Our studies revealed a unique pelagic, suspension feeding behaviour attained by its long ciliated palps in combination with an autopomorphic dorsal ciliated keel and several longitudinal and transverse ciliary bands. Phylogenetic analyses recovered Megadrilus pelagicus n. sp. nested within Protodrilidae indicating that its unique traits are derived within the family. These traits are traced in the tree topologies in correlation to cave colonization. The evolution of these traits can be functionally explained by the different demands of a pelagic suspension feeding strategy compared to the ancestral deposit-feeding guild of the family. The origin of this suspension feeding strategy was presumably favoured by the partial isolation of the anchialine ecosystem, connected to the sea only through the highly porous volcanic subterranean bedrock. This crevicular connection limits the amount of predators and turbulence in the cave, but allows continuous water flow into the system carrying organic particles, which is the main source of food when photosynthetic primary production does not occur and sedimentation is limited. These conditions may select for pelagic suspension feeding as the most feasible life-strategy in anchialine caves, which the dominance of pelagic, suspension feeding crustaceans and annelids in anchialine cave assemblages may also reflect. For species of ancestrally deposit-feeding lineages entering the cave system, such as the annelid families Protodrilidae and Nerillidae, an adaptive-shift from interstitial to crevicular habitats seemingly correlates with dramatic morphological changes and speciation. The dramatic changes observed in these primarily interstitial lineages compared to their relatives, point to alternative adaptive evolutionary pathways related to ecological fitness contrary to the previously proposed theories focusing on geological or stochastic processes.",10.1111/zsc.12198,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We combined observational, experimental, and phylogenetic approaches to determine the extent to which evolutionary history and functional traits determined flocking propensity and perceived predation risk (response to heterospecific alarm calls) in a lowland Amazonian bird community. We predicted that small birds that feed myopically and out in the open would have higher flocking propensities and account for a higher proportion of positive responses to alarms. Using generalized linear models and the incorporation of phylogeny on data from 56 species, our results suggest that phylogenetic relationships alongside body size, foraging height, vegetation density, and response to alarm calls influence flocking propensity. Conversely, phylogenetic relationships did not influence response to heterospecific alarm calls. Among functional traits, however, foraging strategy, foraging density, and flocking propensity partially explained responses to alarm calls.

Since embryological development may take several months, eggs are vulnerable to a variety of threats present in shallow waters, including predation. This study investigates predation of S. officinalis eggs by benthic invertebrates. Twenty-eight invertebrate species from 6 different phyla and with diverse feeding habits were tested as potential predators under laboratory conditions. We also investigated how the feeding traits of these species are related to the mechanical ability to break the egg capsule and prey upon cuttlefish embryos. Species that fed on cuttlefish eggs were the sea snail Bolinus brandaris, the crab Cancer pagurus, the hermit crab Dardanus arrosor, the lobster Homarus gammarus, the invasive blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the shrimp Squilla mantis, the sea urchins Echinus melo, Cidaris sp. and Paracentrotus lividus and the starfish Astropecten aranciacus. It is of note that C. sapidus is a potential predatory crab. which raises the concern that this invasive species may constitute a novel threat for cuttlefish eggs as more populations become established in NE Atlantic waters. Of the biological traits examined, prey capture tools in the tested species best explained the experimental feeding results, suggesting that predation of S. officinalis eggs was determined generally by a mechanical factor and highlighting the importance of the protective egg capsule against predators. However, chemosensory factors are likely to be implicated as well. Thus, this work contributes to the understanding of the ecology of early life stages of cuttlefish and the factors that can affect offspring survival and subsequently impact the recruitment of this species.

With a chronosequence design, our study assesses the pathway and speed of vegetation succession on roadcuts under different specific site conditions, relating environmental factors to species cover by means of a combination of multivariate analyses and Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) modeling. We want to ascertain to what extent environmental factors control primary colonization, establishment and early dynamics of vegetation on dry Mediterranean roadcuts. We found that changes in floristic composition during natural succession on roadcuts are mostly determined by the species-pool effect at different scales (landscape, regional, and local); particular site conditions of roadcuts (slope length, steepness) are also influential factors at a local scale. We also found a shift in the dispersal mode of plant species, from anemochory to zoochory, during succession on tertiary sediments and slates, and a tendency for life-form replacement, from pterophytes to hemicriptophytes, during succession on tertiary sediments. Competitive species are primarily circumscribed to tertiary sediments where succession is not so limited by environmental carrying capacity. Natural colonization is less active on granites, and hence succession is slower. Our results indicate that, in a relatively short time, vegetation communities spontaneously installed under roadcut's environmental harshness are rich in species whether an adjacent seed source is present in remnant patches of natural vegetation. In particular, surrounding woody vegetation favors zoochory dispersion and the early arrival of late-successional species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Whether the myriad changes encompassed by urbanization (e.g., habitat fragmentation, the urban heat island effect, disturbance) affect biological communities in predictable ways remains unresolved. In this study, we employed meta-analysis to quantify the overall effects of urbanization on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), an ecologically diverse and important group that has been relatively well-studied in cities. We calculated effect sizes for carabid species richness, the total abundance of beetles at a site (assemblage abundance), and the abundances of individual species at urban compared to rural forested sites. We found that the number of carabid species in cities was only 77.6% that of corresponding rural sites, whereas assemblage abundance was relatively consistent between rural and urban sites. Such assemblage-level patterns resulted from the loss of certain species from urban sites and the increase in abundance of others. We hypothesized that differences among species would be largely attributable to their ecological traits (body size, habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic position). Through model selection based on information theoretic measures, we found support for the importance of the simple and interactive effects of beetle size, habitat affinity, and trophic position, with the most negative effect sizes for large, forest-specialist beetles that were predatory or omnivorous. Although species traits were key to understanding variation in species abundance effect sizes, several remaining sources of variation in carabid beetle responses to urbanization remain. Specifically, although many species exhibited consistent responses across the studies in which they were sampled and might therefore be considered urban avoiders or urban exploiters, many others were either relatively insensitive to the urbanization gradients or exhibited widely disparate responses across studies. Furthermore, we were unable to attribute variation in species richness and assemblage abundance effect sizes to available measures such as city size and study duration. Instead, additional mechanistic studies across the urbanization gradient will be necessary to understand such variation among studies and for species exhibiting variable responses.",10.1890/ES12-00262.1,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Urban ,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,,"traits = body szie, habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic position",

Functional trait diversity can reveal mechanisms of species coexistence in plant communities. Few studies have tested whether functional diversity for foliar traits related to resource-use strategy increases or decreases with declining soil phosphorus (P) in forest communities.2. We quantified tree basal area and four foliar functional traits (i.e. nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), thickness and tissue density) for all woody species along the c. 120 000 year Franz Josef soil chronosequence in cool temperate rain forest, where strong shifts occur in light and soil nutrient availability (i.e. total soil P declines from 805 to 100 mg kg(-1)). We combined the abundance and trait data in functional diversity indices to quantify trait convergence and divergence, in an effort to determine whether mechanisms of coexistence change with soil fertility.3. Relationships between species trait means and total soil N and P were examined using multiple regression, with and without weighting of species abundances. We used Rao's quadratic entropy to quantify functional diversity at the plot scale, then compared this with random expectation, using a null model that randomizes abundances across species within plots. Taxonomic diversity was measured using Simpson's Diversity. Relationships between functional and taxonomic diversity and total soil P were examined using jackknife linear regression.4. Leaf N and P declined and leaf thickness and density increased monotonically with declining total soil P along the sequence; these relationships were unaffected by abundance weighting of species in the analyses. Inclusion of total soil N did not improve predictions of trait means. All measures of diversity calculated from presence/absence data were unrelated to total soil N and P. There was no evidence for a relationship between Rao values using quantitative abundances and total soil P. However, there was a strong positive relationship between Rao, expressed relative to random expectation, and total soil P, indicating trait convergence of dominant species as soil P declined.5. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate that at high fertility locally dominant species differ in resource-use strategy, but as soil fertility declines over the long term, dominant species increasingly converge on a resource-retentive strategy. This suggests that differentiation in resource-use strategy is required for coexistence at high-fertility but not in low-fertility ecosystems.",10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.01965.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Rainforests,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), thickness and tissue density",

Results None of the PD indices gave high power to detect assembly processes for either the mass effects or priority effects model, even when trait variation was strongly conserved. PD that gave moderate power in the priority-effects model with strong trait conservatism were greatly affected by variation in species richness.

Communities in formerly glaciated regions are composed of smaller, more mobile species and show trait and taxonomical aggregation. In more southerly populations, which did not experience glaciation, earthworm species are larger, have smaller geographical ranges, and communities demonstrate a decrease in species co-occurrence resulting in lower local species richness. Main conclusions We show that species richness gradients can present different - sometimes opposite - latitudinal trends depending upon the scale of the analysis. This scale dependence sheds new light on the underlying causes of global biodiversity gradients. The opposing latitudinal trends of the different components of diversity suggest that recolonization following glaciations during the Pleistocene acted as an environmental filter, and that competitive exclusion may be a more dominant ecological force in these former refugial areas. Overall our results show that past climate changes have left a deep footprint on present-day earthworm diversity patterns, from community to macroecological scales, and that different mechanisms of earthworm community assembly may predominate at different latitudes.",10.1111/jbi.12284,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Other,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"taxonomic = earthworms.

Biological invasions are among the most serious threats to freshwater biodiversity. Analysis of long-term data can be a positive first step toward properly identifying the ecological and economic damage caused by invasive species. This study assessed the potential impacts of invasive channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which have multiplied dramatically since around 2000 in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, on native fish and shrimp and the commercial fishery using fishery-independent, quantitative long-term monitoring data (1993 2007). 2. Temporal changes in abundance of 17 native fish species and one native shrimp species were analysed, and their sensitivity was evaluated, measured as change in relative abundance to the increase in I. punctatus abundance, was evaluated. A trait analysis of 18 species was performed in an attempt to investigate biological traits related to a negative sensitivity to I. punctatus invasion. 3. After controlling for the effect of trophic status (total nitrogen and total phosphorus), nine of the 18 native species declined significantly through time and showed negative sensitivity to the increase in I. punctatus abundance; these included all four species used as raw materials for Japanese traditional processed foods. The trait-based analysis also revealed that benthic species and/or the species with a narrow diet range have decreased in abundance with increasing I. punctatus abundance. This suggests that competition for food, rather than predation by I. punctatus, is an important mechanism that results in a negative impact on native species. 4. This study suggests that I. punctatus invasion may change the native community composition and negatively influence commercially important species, leading to a reduction in the provision of ecosystem goods.

However, often video loggers are deployed with a focus on specific behavioural traits utilizing small cameras with a limited field of view, poor light performance and video quality. Yet rapid developments in consumer electronics provide new devices with much improved visual data allowing a wider scope for studies employing this novel methodology. We developed a camera logger that records full HD video through a wide-angle lens, providing high resolution footage with a greater field of view than other camera loggers. The main goal was to assess the suitability of this type of camera for the analysis of various aspects of the foraging ecology of a marine predator, the yellow-eyed penguin in New Zealand. Frame-by-frame analysis allowed accurate timing of prey pursuits and time spent over certain seafloor types. The recorded video footage showed that prey species were associated with certain seafloor types, revealed different predator evasion strategies by benthic fishes, and highlighted varying energetic consequences for penguins pursuing certain types of prey. Other aspects that could be analysed were the timing of breathing intervals between dives and observe exhalation events during prey pursuits, a previously undescribed behaviour. Screen overlays facilitated analysis of flipper angles and beat frequencies throughout various stages of the dive cycle. Flipper movement analysis confirmed decreasing effort during descent phases as the bird gained depth, and that ascent was principally passive. Breathing episodes between dives were short (<1 s) while the majority of the time was devoted to subsurface scanning with a submerged head. Video data recorded on free-ranging animals not only provide a wealth of information recorded from a single deployment but also necessitate new approaches with regards to analysis of visual data. Here, we demonstrate the diversity of information that can be gleaned from video logger data, if devices with high video resolution and wide field of view are utilized.",10.7717/peerj.5459,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

G.",2009,Relative influence of landscape vs. local factors on plant community assembly in restored wetlands.,Ecological Applications,"Ecological restoration often involves only the manipulation of abiotic factors at the local scale. However, processes external to a restoration site determine the range of local conditions within the site, constraining the level of restoration progress that can be achieved by on-site manipulations. We examined the relationship of landscape and local explanatory variables to plant species composition in 28 restored wetlands in Illinois, USA. Using constrained ordination combined with variation partitioning, we determined the independent and joint effects of three spatially hierarchical sets of variables: (1) macroscale landscape features reflecting site setting within regional landscapes, (2) mesoscale landscape features reflecting nearby propagule sources and buffers from disturbances, and (3) local environmental factors. Because the relative influence of landscape- vs. local-scale factors on restoration success may depend on particular restoration goals, we repeated the analyses using three multivariate plant community responses that represented three frequently stated goals: (1) replicating species composition, (2) restoring a particular wetland community type, and (3) constructing sites with high value for plant conservation. Explanatory variables at landscape and local scales had independent and nearly equally strong relationships to plant species composition. In contrast, when species were aggregated based on plant traits, the independent contribution of local predictors was greater than the independent contributions of macroscale or mesoscale landscape predictors, reflecting convergence of plant trait composition in sites with similar local conditions. Local predictors explained a significant amount of variation in plant conservation value among sites, but much of the variation could be explained by large-scale landscape setting, indicating that landscape constraints on local environmental conditions limited the level of floristic conservation value achievable. The appropriate scale at which to focus restoration efforts will vary depending upon restoration objectives. Restoration of particular wetland community types might be successfully achieved through manipulation of local abiotic factors. In contrast, restoration of a particular species assemblage or reconstruction of wetlands with high value for conservation requires consideration of landscape processes and available species pools.",10.1890/08-1836.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = habitat preference, growth form",
"Matyas, C",1996,Climatic adaptation of trees: Rediscovering provenance tests,EUPHYTICA,"Common garden testing of populations of different origin started with forest trees more than two hundred years ago. Since then, so-called provenance tests have been established with most commercially important species. Beyond the strictly silvicultural goals, the tests offer excellent opportunities to study intraspecific genetic variation patterns and represent probably the most powerful available tool for testing hypotheses of climatic adaptation in trees. Analysis of adaptive traits (mostly juvenile height growth) in provenance experiments indicate the existence of very effective constraints on adaptedness. The performance of populations plotted against an ecological-climatic factor exhibits a characteristic pattern and can be described by response functions. The population average of a fitness-related trait for a locally adapted population is often significantly lower than that of populations from other environments; usually the ones from milder climate perform better. The phenomenon is interpreted as adaptation lag. Suboptimal adaptation is compensated by a high level of genetic diversity. Molecular genetic studies confirm the high level of allelic and individual genetic diversity in forest trees. A consequence of individual homeostasis, phenotypic stability of populations is usually also high; the sensitivity to environmental changes is generally moderate. Phenotypically stable populations are valuable not only because of a wider ran but specifically because of a greater ability to adjust to unexpected changes. This trait should receive more attention in the future for obvious reasons. The maintenance of a high within-population genetic variance is favored by the genetic system of the investigated species (effective gene flow, outbreeding, high gene tic load, etc.). Random events and long-lasting biotic interactions are further effects impairing the efficiency of natural selection. In view of expected climate instability, genetic adaptability of forest trees causes serious concern due to their long lifespan compared to the rapidity of expected changes in environmental conditions. The potential of provenance tests to interpret long-term adaptational processes should be utilized to analyze, model and predict response of trees to climate change. Although seldomly appreciated, provenance research might be among the most important contributions of forestry to biological sciences.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here, using a trophodynamic approach and global databases of catches and life history traits of marine species, we tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic ecological impacts may have led to changes in the global parameters defining the transfers of biomass within the food web. First, we developed two indicators to assess such changes: the Time Cumulated Indicator (TCI) measuring the residence time of biomass within the food web, and the Efficiency Cumulated Indicator (ECI) quantifying the fraction of secondary production reaching the top of the trophic chain. Then, we assessed, at the large marine ecosystem scale, the worldwide change of these two indicators over the 1950-2010 time-periods. Global trends were identified and cluster analyses were used to characterize the variability of trends between ecosystems. Results showed that the most common pattern over the study period is a global decrease in TCI, while the ECI indicator tends to increase. Thus, changes in species assemblages would induce faster and apparently more efficient biomass transfers in marine food webs. Results also suggested that the main driver of change over that period had been the large increase in fishing pressure. The largest changes occurred in ecosystems where 'fishing down the marine food web' are most intensive.",10.1371/journal.pone.0182826,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Marine,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,0,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,Exploitation,0,0,1,1,trait = growth rate,

Although habitat fragmentation and climate are expected to affect plant communities interactively, there is a lack of empirical studies addressing trait associations to fragmentation in different climatic regimes. In this study, we analyse data on the key functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), plant height, seed mass and seed number. First, we assess the evidence for the community assembly mechanisms habitat filtering and competition at different spatial scales, using several null-models and a comprehensive set of community-level trait convergence and divergence indices. Second, we analyse the association of community-mean traits with patch area and connectivity along a south-north productivity gradient. We found clear evidence for trait convergence due to habitat filtering. In contrast, the evidence for trait divergence due to competition fundamentally depended on the null-model used. When the null-model controlled for habitat filtering, there was only evidence for trait divergence at the smallest sampling scale (0.25 m x 0.25 m). All traits varied significantly along the S-N productivity gradient. While plant height and SLA were consistently associated with fragmentation, the association of seed mass and seed number with fragmentation changed along the S-N gradient. Our findings indicate trait convergence due to drought stress in the arid sites and due to higher productivity in the mesic sites. The association of plant traits to fragmentation is likely driven by increased colonization ability in small and/or isolated patches (plant height, seed number) or increased persistence ability in isolated patches (seed mass). Our study provides the first empirical test of trait associations with fragmentation along a productivity gradient. We conclude that it is crucial to study the interactive effects of different ecological drivers on plant functional traits. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Although there is some evidence that differences in personality among individuals within populations can be genetically based and adaptive, when and how individual personality differences emerge in a population is not well understood, but of considerable general interest. Here, using juveniles of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania siquia) as a model system, we investigated in the laboratory whether individuals consistently differ in their personalities and whether behavioral syndromes are apparent at an early developmental stage and, if so, whether distinct personality traits are heritable. Under standardized laboratory conditions and using sibling analysis, we quantified interindividual differences in their boldness behavior under potential predation threat and their exploratory activity in a novel environment, 2 ecologically important behaviors, as our focal personality traits and estimated their respective repeatability and heritability. We report for the first time consistent (repeatable) and heritable individual differences in boldness and exploratory behaviors, and a boldness-exploration behavioral syndrome, in young convict cichlids. Bolder fish were more exploratory than relatively timid ones. These results provide novel evidence for the emergence in early life history of consistent individual differences in personality traits and behavioral syndromes in this species and suggest that genetic variation for boldness and exploratory behaviors, and thus potential for selection on these traits, exists in our study population.",10.1093/beheco/arv030,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Predictive modelling of the impacts of climate change has highlighted a need for on-ground monitoring of mammal communities within the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland to inform wildlife conservation management. Standard mammal-survey techniques are labour intensive and often incapable of detecting rare, trap-shy or otherwise elusive species, effectively rendering them invisible to researchers even when substantial resources are applied.Aims. To assess the utility of feeding remains (regurgitated pellets) from lesser sooty owls, Tyto tenebricosa multipunctata, for monitoring populations of small to medium-sized mammals within the Wet Tropics.Methods. Three female lesser sooty owls were radio-tracked to determine home-range areas. Radio-tracking and targeted systematic searches were used to locate diurnal roosts containing owl pellets from which prey species were identified. Owl-pellet data were directly compared with live-trap data within three putative owl home ranges. Additionally, analyses of a dataset spanning more than 15 years demonstrated the utility of owl-pellet data for monitoring mammal communities.Key results. Owl-pellet surveys yielded 14 mammal species (840 individuals) from 152 man-hours, compared with six mammal species (361 individuals) from 194 man-hours of live trapping. Both survey methods identified Rattus fuscipes, Melomys spp. and Antechinus spp. as the most abundant species but live-trap data were found to under-represent relative abundance of Melomys spp. and over-represent relative abundance of R. fuscipes in comparison to owl-pellet data.Conclusions. Analysis of lesser sooty owl pellets is a particularly useful method for compilation of species inventories of small to medium-sized mammals, being more effective than standard live-trapping surveys within the rainforests of the Wet Tropics.Implications. Owl-pellet analysis is well suited for monitoring mammal communities, as long as periodic data are collected from the same roost(s) and the pellets have been deposited by the same individual bird(s). Additional research relating to variability in behavioural traits between individual lesser sooty owls that have potential to confound results via sampling bias must be undertaken before owl-pellet data can be used for comparison of mammal community structure among sites, or for monitoring a site over a period spanning a change in the individual owls that are depositing pellets at that site.",10.1071/WR13041,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

To begin to understand these correlations, we studied foraging mode variation in natural foraging behavior and attack speed in three ambush predators and two widely foraging species in the field. Sequential analyses revealed considerable variation in the temporal structure of behavioral repertoires associated with acquiring food. Ambush and wide-foraging species use unique combinations of behaviors prior to prey attack with differences among and between food acquisition modes. Attack speeds were well below maximum sprint speed for these species. Thus, the widely demonstrated correlation between food acquisition mode and sprint speed is not related to prey capture per se.

However, in most examples of adaptive radiation the mechanistic basis of ecological divergence remains unclear. A classic example is seen in the young benthic and limnetic stickleback species pairs of British Columbia. In each pair the benthic species feeds on littoral macroinvertebrates whereas the limnetic feeds on pelagic zooplankton. Previous studies indicate that in both short-term feeding trials and long-term enclosure studies, benthics and limnetics exhibit enhanced performance on their own resource but fare more poorly on the other species' resource. We examined the functional basis of ecological divergence in the stickleback species pair from Paxton Lake, BC, using biomechanical models of fish feeding applied to morphological traits. We examined the consequences of morphological differences using high speed video of feeding fish.Results: Benthic stickleback possess morphological traits that predict high suction generation capacity, including greatly hypertrophied epaxial musculature. In contrast, limnetic stickleback possess traits thought to enhance capture of evasive planktonic prey, including greater jaw protrusion than benthics and greater displacement advantage in both the lower jaw-opening lever system and the opercular four-bar linkage. Kinematic data support the expectations from the morphological analysis that limnetic stickleback exhibit faster strikes and greater jaw protrusion than benthic fish, whereas benthics exert greater suction force on attached prey.Conclusions: We reveal a previously unknown suite of complex morphological traits that affect rapid ecological divergence in sympatric stickleback.

Survival to reproductive age relies upon optimal non-reproductive trait expression, such as adequate predator avoidance responses, which may be impacted through EDC exposure. During a predator-prey confrontation, larval fish use an innate C-start escape behavior to rapidly move away from an approaching threat. We tested the hypotheses that (1) larval fathead minnows exposed to estrogens, a primary class of EDCs, singularly or in mixture, suffer a reduced ability to perform an innate C-start behavior when faced with a threat stimulus; (2) additive effects will cause greater reductions in C-start behavior; and (3) effects will differ among developmental stages. In this study, embryos (post-fertilization until hatching)were exposed for 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) singularly and in mixture. Exposed embryos were allowed to hatch and grow in control well water until 12 days old. Similarly, post-hatch fathead minnows were exposed for 12 days to these compounds. High-speed (1000 frames/s) video recordings of escape behavior were collected and transferred to National Institutes of Health Image for frame-by-frame analysis of latency period, escape velocity, and total escape response (combination of latency period and escape velocity). When tested 12 days post-hatch, only El adversely affected C-start performance of larvae exposed as embryos. Conversely, larvae exposed for 12 days post-hatch did not exhibit altered escape responses when exposed to Ell, while adverse responses were seen in E2 and the estrogen mixture. Ethinylestradiol exposure did not elicit changes in escape behaviors at either developmental stage. The direct impact of reduced C-start performance on survival, and ultimately, reproductive fitness provides an avenue to assess the ecological relevance of exposure in an assay of relatively short duration.

In this study, we examined the relationship between host lineage, captive diet, and life stage and gut microbiota characteristics in three primate species (infraorder, Lemuriformes). Fecal samples were collected from captive lemur mothers and their infants, from birth to weaning. Microbial DNA was extracted and the v4 region of 16S rDNA was sequenced on the Illumina platform using protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project.

Our analyses reveal community membership and succession patterns consistent with previous studies of human infants, suggesting that lemurs may serve as a useful model of microbial ecology in the primate gut. Each lemur species exhibits distinct species-specific bacterial diversity signatures correlating to life stages and life history traits, implying that gut microbial community assembly primes developing infants at species-specific rates for their respective adult feeding strategies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0124618,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here, we combine field data of a host-pathogen community with empirical models to test the effects that (i) spatial scale and (ii) host range have on the relationship between plant-virus infection prevalence and diversity. We show that prevalence-diversity relationships are scale-dependent and can produce opposite effects associated with different habitats at sub-ecosystem scales. The total number of host species of each virus reflected generalism at the ecosystem scale. However, plasticity in host range resembled habitat-specific specialization and also changed model predictions. We show that habitat heterogeneity, ignored at larger (ecosystem) spatial scales, influences pathogen distributions.

As such, these food webs are replete with extremely generalized feeding strategies, especially among the larger bodied, higher trophic position taxa. The movement scale of aquatic organisms also generally increases with body size and trophic position. Together, these body size, mobility, and foraging relationships suggest that organisms lower in the food web generate relatively distinct energetic pathways by feeding over smaller spatial areas. Concurrently, the potential capacity for generalist foraging and spatial coupling of these pathways often increases, on average, moving up the food web toward higher trophic levels. We argue that these attributes make for a food web architecture that is inherently 'adaptive' in its response to environmental conditions. This is because variation in lower trophic level dynamics is dampened by the capacity of predators to flexibly alter their foraging behavior. We argue that empirical, theoretical, and applied research needs to embrace this inherently adaptive architecture if we are to understand the relationship between structure and function in the face of ongoing environmental change. Toward this goal, we discuss empirical patterns in the structure of lake food webs to suggest that ecosystems change consistently, from individual traits to the structure of whole food webs, under changing environmental conditions. We then explore an empirical example to reveal that explicitly unfolding the mechanisms that drive these adaptive responses offers insight into how human-driven impacts, such as climate change, invasive species, and fisheries harvest, ought to influence ecosystem structure and function (e.g., stability, secondary productivity, maintenance of major energy pathways).

"McNamara, John M.; Leimar, Olof",2010,Variation and the response to variation as a basis for successful cooperation,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"In applying game theory to problems in biology, differences between individuals are often ignored. In particular, when analysing the evolution of cooperation it is often implicitly assumed that ignoring variation will produce predictions that approximate the solution when differences are included. This need not be true. As we demonstrate, differences are not innocuous noise, but can fundamentally change the nature of a game. Even small amounts of variability can stabilize cooperation by, for example, maintaining the need to deal with cheaters. Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction, leading to contingent behaviour that can reduce conflict, and to negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than unconditional actions. Once there are mechanisms such as mutation and environmental influences that maintain variation within populations, whether cooperation evolves may depend on the variation in the cooperativeness trait. Variation means that it may be worth taking a chance that a partner is cooperative by being cooperative. When there are markets, so that individuals can break off interactions to seek a better partner, variation promotes choosiness and hence penalizes those uncooperative individuals, who are rejected. Variation promotes the need to monitor the previous behaviour of others, and once this social sensitivity exists, the need to maintain a good reputation can promote cooperation.",10.1098/rstb.2010.0159,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"McNickle, Gordon G.; Brown, Joel S.",2014,An ideal free distribution explains the root production of plants that do not engage in a tragedy of the commons game,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"1. Below-ground competition is intense and may dramatically reduce plant performance. However, there is still no consensus on the best strategies plants should use to maximize competitive ability in soil. Some suggest plants should grow roots according to nutrient availability, while others suggest plants should grow roots taking into account both nutrients and neighbours. Unambiguously, testing between these two alternative hypotheses has been challenging.2. This manuscript had three objectives. First, we presented a model of root growth under competition that is based on an ideal free distribution (IFD). Secondly, we develop the concept of the best response curve as a tool for clearer experimental tests of plant responses to neighbours. Thirdly, we test these ideas by growing fast cycling Brassica rapa either alone or with neighbours to examine this species' root growth strategy both alone and under competition.3. We hypothesize that those plants with no direct response to neighbours should grow roots according to an IFD. This means that if plants produce x roots in a soil volume of quality R, they should produce x/n roots in a soil volume of quality R/n. The experimental data were consistent with this prediction. Growing plants with neighbours was statistically identical to growing them with half as many nutrients. Thus, the only effect of neighbours was to reduce nutrient availability.4. This model provides an alternative to previous game theoretic models and suggests an experimental protocol based on the concept of the best response curve. We hope that testing the game theoretic model with a clear alternative model will guide experiment and debate.5. Synthesis. The data in the literature are mixed, with species sometimes responding to nutrients only, and sometimes responding interactively to both nutrients and neighbours. At present, we lack a general understanding of the causes or consequences of this diversity of strategies. We suggest that a greater understanding of trade-offs among traits that are important for other biotic interactions (above-ground competition, enemy defence, mutualisms) will lead to a greater understanding of why some species over-proliferate roots when in competition but other species do not.",10.1111/1365-2745.12259,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"McPherson, JM; Yeager, LA; Baum, JK",2018,A simulation tool to scrutinise the behaviour of functional diversity metrics,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Many indices have been proposed to measure functional diversity and its four distinct dimensions: functional richness, evenness, divergence and redundancy. Identifying indices that reliably measure the functional diversity dimension(s) of interest requires careful testing of how each index responds to species' traits and abundance distributions. In the absence of a convenient simulation tool, tests with artificial data have to date explored only a limited number of scenarios or have altered trait and abundance distributions only indirectly based on principles of evolution and community assembly. We provide simul.comms, an R function that allows users to test the efficacy of functional diversity indices by easily creating artificial species communities with user-specified abundance and trait distributions for continuous, ordinal and categorical traits. To illustrate the function's utility, we examine the performance of R, a recently published abundance-sensitive index for functional redundancy. We use two approaches to designing simulation tests for this example analysis. The first uses simul.comms to create six separate sets of artificial communities to qualitatively assess how R responds to predictable changes in functional redundancy. The second uses simul.comms to independently alter seven community composition parameters, whose influence on R is then examined quantitatively via effect sizes in linear regression. Our analyses indicate that R broadly mirrors expected changes in functional redundancy and predictably responds to changes in community composition parameters. R appears, however, to primarily reflect trait distributions, responding minimally to variance in abundance and counter-intuitively to abundance range. Further refinement of tools to measure functional redundancy may therefore be desirable. The R tool we provide should assist with refining functional diversity measures, a critical step towards improving our ability to understand and mitigate the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. Because simul.comms simply produces two linked matrices, a species-by-traits matrix and a site-by-species abundance matrix, it may be equally valuable in exploring questions and analytical approaches in other areas of community ecology.",10.1111/2041-210X.12855,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The partial syntopy of three viper species (V. ammodytes, V. aspis, and V. berus) is exceptional and has become known only from two neighbouring valleys in the southern Julian Pre-Alps along the Italian-Slovenian border (Valle Mea and Nadiza Valley). This unique situation puts forward questions concerning their co-existence, particularly when considering that natural hybrids are known among all three species. Our principal goals for this article were therefore to evaluate variation and integrity of key dorsal colour pattern and body size among V. berus, V. ammodytes, and V. aspis from Mount Stol, Nadiza Valley in Slovenia. We discuss these variations in the context of potential hybridization, interspecific competition, and local to regional synecological properties including diet, habitat, and climate. Despite the fact that a pre-study specimen showed intermediate colour pattern, suggesting a hybrid between V. ammodytes and V. aspis, no further intermediate specimens (n > 100) were detected based on external features. Comparison of body length and mass shows equal sizes between V. ammodytes and V. aspis, whereas V. berus is approximately 30% smaller. Furthermore, V. berus on Mount Stol is also much smaller and lacks melanism, unlike V. berus from a close population in Italy (< 15 km), where they are larger and melanism is relatively frequent. These local character expressions presumably are the result of environmental constraints at high elevations (> 1200 m asl.), such as a harsh climate of open, non-forested habitat and possibly a regionally different predation pressure and diet composition. At mid-elevation < 1200 m asl., syntopic V. ammodytes and V. aspis may compete for food, yet, the previously evaluated microhabitat differences appear sufficient to maintain species integrity for these two viper populations.",unkown_15,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Herps,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body size, dorsal colour pattern",

Several theories predict changes in community traits, relevant for ecosystem functioning, with higher temperature. The space-for-time substitution approach (SETS) provides one of the most plausible empirical evaluations for these theories, helping to elucidate the long-term consequences of changes in climate.Here, we reviewed the changes at the community level for the main freshwater taxa and assemblages (i.e. fishes, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, macrophytes, phytoplankton, periphyton and bacterioplankton), under different climates. We analyzed data obtained from latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and cross-comparison (i.e. SFTS) studies, supplemented by an analysis of published geographically dispersed data for those communities or traits not covered in the SETS literature.We found only partial empirical evidence supporting the theoretical predictions. The prediction of higher richness at warmer locations was supported for fishes, phytoplankton and periphyton, while the opposite was true for macroinvertebrates and zooplankton. With decreasing latitude, the biomass of cladoceran zooplankton and periphyton and the density of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates declined (opposite for fishes for both biomass and density variables). Fishes and cladoceran zooplankton showed the expected reduction in body size with higher;temperature: Life history changes in fish and zooplankton and stronger trophic interactions at intermediate positions in the food web (fish predation on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) were evident, but also a weaker grazing pressure of zooplankton on phytoplankton occurred with increasing temperatures. The potential impacts of lake productivity, fish predation and other factors, such as salinity, were often stronger than those of temperature itself. Additionally, shallow lakes may shift between alternative states, complicating theoretical predictions of warming effects. SFTS and meta-analyses approaches have their shortcomings, but in combination with experimental and model studies that help reveal mechanisms, the ""field situation"" is indispensable to understand the potential effects of warming.",10.1016/B978-0-12-396992-7.00004-6,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Broad,Broad,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body size, diet",

We investigated whether biotic interactions with larval host plants or ants are phylogenetically constrained in the evolutionary history of Arhopala, by collating available information on the ecology of Arhopala from the literature as well as from personal observations, and analysing and interpreting these data rigorously in a phylogenetic context. Larvae of all species in the sister-group of Arhopala and Flos feed on Fabaceae. However, the predominant feeding preference of Arhopala s.l, with the exception of a particular monophyletic and species-rich group, called 'Group A' appears to be centred on Fagaceae, with additional records of Dipterocarpaceae feeding. The preference for Fagaceae has strong phylogenetic inertia, as indicated by T-PTP tests designed to test for phylogenetic signal. Adding all available life-history data, using the phylogeny presented before as scaffolding, further increased the phylogenetic signal in host plant data. Feeding on Fabaceae (mainly in the outgroup) and Euphorbiaceae also showed significant phylogenetic signal, but feeding on Dipterocarpaceae did not and was found scattered across the phylogeny. Except for the Dipterocarpaceae, phylogenetic signal in feeding preferences was very clear, even despite uneven taxon sampling and apparent lability in host plant use. Ant association also demonstrated historical constraint, but based on the phylogenetic hypothesis presented here it was not clear whether increased ant association intimacy emerged independently various times in Group A, as well as in several basal groups. Our finding of distinct phylogenetic patterns in the host plant and to a lesser degree in ant association data contradicts the hypothesis that life-history traits are very labile in the Lycaenidae.

"Meiners, Scott J.; Cadotte, Marc W.; Fridley, Jason D.; Pickett, Steward T. A.; Walker, Lawrence R.",2015,Is successional research nearing its climax? New approaches for understanding dynamic communities,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Succession has been a focus of extensive ecological study for well over a century. Despite this sustained interest, succession remains a central theme in ecological research and is positioned to continue that prominence in this era of expanding human impacts. Community ecology is currently experiencing a profound conceptual expansion, providing many new insights into succession. Here we present an existing conceptual framework of successional drivers that includes variation in site conditions, species availability and species performance, and expand it to include both evolutionary and geographic sources of variation. This framework is useful because it specifies relationships among individual drivers and is causally complete. While we generally think about succession as a within-site process, the inclusion of phylogenetic and geographic processes allows integration across broader scales. We use the conceptual framework to highlight several opportunities for successional research that have developed within community ecology, but have not been fully integrated into succession work. These ideas represent not only individual drivers of succession, but also potential synergistic processes operating through interaction with other drivers. The complexity of drivers in succession strongly argues for the need to move away from single factor studies towards combinatorial studies that incorporate multiple drivers. Utilizing a trait-based approach should allow researchers to address successional drivers at multiple ecological scales and lead to new insights that integrate ecological systems. Our ability to do this will depend on the availability of equivalent data across multiple systems, suggesting the need for more standardization in successional studies. Addressing the research opportunities highlighted here will not only produce insights into successional systems, but also expand our understanding of fundamental questions in community ecology as a whole. Of particular importance is the ability to address broader scale questions that go beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual sites and systems. Understanding the dynamics of successional systems will remain critical to understanding, managing and predicting anthropogenic impacts on natural systems.",10.1111/1365-2435.12391,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Vegetation types were assessed for abundance and diversity of nematode communities and inferred ecological relationships between them. Soils were sampled from tropical rainforest, tropical dry deciduous forest, temperate coniferous forest and xerophytic shrub during 2013, 2014 and 2015. Fourteen sampling sites with ca 10-20 samples per site from 11 localities spread across Central Mexico were assessed. Altitudes sampled ranged from 113 m a.s.l.

A total of 13 263 individuals from 25 identified families of nematodes were collected. Family abundance and complementarity indices between sites revealed to some extent the affinities between vegetation types. Nevertheless, statistical analyses revealed no differences between nematode family abundances between sites, only between families across all sites. Molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) methods were employed as a framework to assess biodiversity. From these, 77 high-quality sequences for taxonomic barcoding were recovered and later identified with morphological traits. Only six sequences matched at a 98-99% level with those reported in GenBank.

To predict the effects of climate change, it is important to know whether productivity is linked to temperature, and whether species' traits affect responses to climate change. To address these objectives, we analysed monitoring data from the Finnish constant effort site ringing scheme collected in 1987-2013 for 20 common songbird species together with climatic data. Warm spring temperature had a positive linear relationship with productivity across the community of 20 species independent of species' traits (realized thermal niche or migration behaviour), suggesting that even the warmest spring temperatures remained below the thermal optimum for reproduction, possibly due to our boreal study area being closer to the cold edge of all study species' distributions. The result also suggests a lack of mismatch between the timing of breeding and peak availability of invertebrate food of the study species. Productivity was positively related to annual growth rates in long-distance migrants, but not in short-distance migrants. Across the 27-year study period, temporal trends in productivity were mostly absent. The population sizes of species with colder thermal niches had decreasing trends, which were not related to temperature responses or temporal trends in productivity.

However, there is no consensus about the relative importance of niche and spatial processes to explain the distribution of anuran species in tropical systems. In our study, we analyzed the niche and neutral effects on anuran assemblages and found that biotic interactions were a predictor of assemblage structure. The Eltonian concept of niche was the best predictor for the structure of aquatic-breeding anuran assemblages, as species tended to co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. We suggest that the lack of environmental effect could be explained by differences in the pattern of movement between arboreal and non-arboreal anurans. Once there is a reduction in the number of arboreal anurans in open areas, the importance of habitat heterogeneity to explain assemblage composition should decrease. The lack of correlation between the spatial component in our model and species composition is evidence that spatial processes, such as migration, did not play a major role in structuring local assemblages. Anurans are generally assumed as having poor dispersal ability, yet this assumption is not true for all anuran species. We suggest that future studies should include key behavioral traits, such as site fidelity and homing behavior, as these traits can represent the dispersal abilities of anurans and dispersal ability seems to be important when we try to predict patterns of anuran distribution.",10.1111/btp.12130,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,Didn't actually look at traits just said they're good,

We investigated the diet of Eurasian lynx from feces collected Mediterranean, mixed forest-steppe, and subalpine ecosystems of Turkey. We studied prey preferences and functional responses using prey densities obtained from Random Encounter Modelling. Our analysis revealed that the main prey was brown hare (Lepus europaeus) in all three areas (78%-99% of biomass consumed) and lynx showed a strong preference for brown hare (Chesson's selectivity index, =0.90-0.99). Cannibalism contributed at least 5% in two study areas. The type II functional response of lynx populations in Turkey was similar to the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and daily food intake in grams per lynx matched that of Canada lynx and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), both lagomorph specialists, rather than those of Eurasian lynx from Europe. Therefore, lynx in Turkey may be better described as a lagomorph specialist even though it coexists with ungulate prey. We suggest that ungulate-based foraging ecology of Eurasian lynx in Europe may be a recent adjustment to the availability of high densities of ungulates and cannot be representative for other regions like Turkey.

Crucial to achieving this is identifying management options that are practical and beneficial to biodiversity, and understanding the influence of the surrounding landscape. We used data on abundance and species richness of farmland macro-moths, many of which are declining, and trait-based analyses on their feeding guild, mobility and conservation status, to explore local- and landscape-scale effects of two farmland features (extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees) and surrounding farmland intensification. Macro-moths were light trapped at 48 fixed sites on 16 farms, over 4 years, within a 1200-km2 area of lowland UK farmland. Sites belonged to one of four experimental groups that differed in their combinations of hedgerow tree presence and field margin width. Hedgerow trees and extended-width field margins locally increased species richness, but not abundance, of macro-moths, irrespective of each other's presence. Overall, species richness and abundance were not affected by agricultural intensification, as measured by the amount of arable land in the surrounding landscape. Sedentary moths showed double the species richness, but were half as abundant as mobile moths. Both groups responded positively to extended-width margin and hedgerow tree presence. The effect of hedgerow trees was particularly strong for shrub- and/or tree-feeding species. Analyses based on the conservation status of moths demonstrated that agricultural intensification lowered the species richness of nationally severely declining UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species and the abundance of both nationally moderately declining and priority species. These effects were most pronounced at the 0.8-km radius scale. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the presence of extended-width field margins and hedgerow trees, possibly promoted by agri-environment schemes targeting their implementation at relatively small spatial scales (0.8 km), may help mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on macro-moths. A wide range of other taxa feed on macro-moths and may therefore indirectly benefit from these features.

We documented substantial interspecific variation in both absolute and proportional endocrine profiles. PCAs indicated that glucocorticoids generally clustered together (PC1), but other classes of steroids did not.

Significant advances have been and continue to be made in developing ever more refined keys to macroinvertebrate groups. When advances in macroinvertebrate ecological research are restricted by the level of detail in identifications, then analysis by function is a viable alternative. The focus on function, namely adaptations of macroinvertebrates to habitats and the utilization of food resources, has facilitated ecological evaluation of freshwater ecosystems. This classification is based not on what insects eat, but how they obtain their food. These categories are called ""functional feeding groups"", as the name implies, denoting their functional role when describing how and where they feed. This is the basis for the functional feeding group (FFG) method that was initially developed in the early 1960s. Taxonomy is applied only to the level of detail that allows assignment to one of five functional feeding group categories: detrital shredders, scrapers, filtering collectors, gatherers, and predators. The aim of this short communication, originating from the presentation of R.W. Merritt at the Biomonitoring Symposium in Rome, 2015, is to promote the use of a functional approach in biomonitoring, especially in Italian and European lotic systems. Here, we present two case studies and we discuss the advantages of the method, especially considering the great availability of quantitative data on macroinvertebrates after the implementation of the WFD 2000/60.

Plant phenotypic diversity is shaped by the interplay of trade-offs and constraints in evolution. Closely integrated groups of traits (i.e. trait dimensions) are used to classify plant phenotypic diversity into plant strategies, but we do not know the degree of interdependence among trait dimensions. To assess how selection has shaped the phenotypic space, we examine whether trait dimensions are independent. 2. We gathered data on saplings of 24 locally coexisting tree species in a temperate forest, and examined the correlation structure of 20 leaf, branch, stem and root traits. These traits fall into three well-established trait dimensions (the leaf economic spectrum, the wood spectrum and Corner's Rules) that characterize vital plant functions: resource acquisition, sap transport, mechanical support and canopy architecture. Using ordinations, network analyses and Mantel tests, we tested whether the sapling phenotype of these tree species is organized along independent trait dimensions. 3. Across species, the sapling phenotype is not structured into clear trait dimensions. The trait relationships defining trait dimensions are either weak or absent and do not dominate the correlation structure of the sapling phenotype as a whole. Instead traits from the three commonly recognized trait dimensions are organized into an integrated trait network. The effect of phylogeny on trait correlations is minimal. 4. Our results indicate that trait dimensions apparent in broad-based interspecific surveys do not hold up among locally coexisting species. Furthermore, architectural traits appear central to the phenotypic network, suggesting a pivotal role for branching architecture in linking resource acquisition, mechanical support and hydraulic functions. 5. Synthesis. Our study indicates that local and global patterns of phenotypic integration differ and calls into question the use of trait dimensions at local scales.

This body of work has emphasized the importance of both habitat filtering and dispersal limitation, and many of these works have utilized the assumption of species spatial independence to simplify the complexity of the spatial modeling in natural communities when given dispersal limitation and/or habitat filtering. One potential drawback of this simplification is that it does not consider species interactions and how they may influence the spatial distribution of species, phylogenetic and functional diversity. Here, we assess the validity of the assumption of species spatial independence using data from a subtropical forest plot in southeastern China.MethodsWe use the four most commonly employed spatial statistical models-the homogeneous Poisson process representing pure random effect, the heterogeneous Poisson process for the effect of habitat heterogeneity, the homogenous Thomas process for sole dispersal limitation and the heterogeneous Thomas process for joint effect of habitat heterogeneity and dispersal limitation-to investigate the contribution of different mechanisms in shaping the species, phylogenetic and functional structures of communities.Important FindingsOur evidence from species, phylogenetic and functional diversity demonstrates that the habitat filtering and/or dispersal-based models perform well and the assumption of species spatial independence is relatively valid at larger scales (50 x 50 m).

However, differences in these traits do not necessarily lead to functional differences and/or can be context-dependent. Therefore, it is necessary to explicitly test whether the surrogates have general ecological relevance. To investigate the relationship between the hunting strategies of predators (i.e., how, where, and when they hunt) and their function, we used euryphagous spiders as a model group. We used published data on the diet composition of 76 spider species based on natural prey and laboratory prey acceptance experiments. We computed differences in the position and width of trophic niches among pairs of sympatrically occurring species. Pairs were made at different classification levels, ranked according to the dissimilarity in their hunting strategies: congeners, confamiliars (as phylogenetic proxies for similarity in hunting strategy), species from the same main class of hunting strategy, from the same supra-class, and from different supra-classes. As for niche position computed from the natural prey analyses, species from the same class differed less than species from different classes. A similar pattern was obtained from the laboratory studies, but the congeners differed less than the species from the same classes. Niche widths were most similar among congeners and dissimilar among species from different supra-classes. Functional differences among euryphagous spiders increased continuously with increasing difference in their hunting strategy. The relative frequency of hunting strategies within spider assemblages can, therefore, influence the food webs through hunting strategy-specific predator-prey interactions.",10.1007/s00442-016-3631-4,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = diet, hunting strategy",

PEAs can potentially provide information on the evolutionary dynamics of a particular set of populations, but this requires a full theoretical characterization of PEAs and their evolution. Here, we derive formulas for the expected PEA in a temporally fluctuating environment for a quantitative trait with a linear reaction norm. We compare several biologically relevant scenarios, including constant versus evolving plasticity, and the situation in which an environment affects both development and selection but at different time periods. We find that PEAs are determined not only by biological factors (e.g., magnitude of plasticity, genetic variation), but also environmental factors, such as the association between the environments of development and of selection, and in some cases the level of temporal autocorrelation. We also describe how a PEA can be used to estimate the relationship between an optimum phenotype and an environmental variable (i.e., the environmental sensitivity of selection), an important parameter for determining the extinction risk of populations experiencing environmental change. We illustrate this ability using published data on the predator-induced morphological responses of tadpoles to predation risk.",10.1111/evo.12371,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Using a natural Daphnia magna population, we undertook an experimental investigation aimed to describe the genetic variation for DHM and to study whether an adaptive micro-evolutionary response occurred to changes in macrophyte coverage and fish predation pressure through time. Twenty-seven D. magna clones were hatched from ephippia in the sediment of shallow Lake Ring, Denmark. This lake was eutrophied during the 20th century and was subject to restoration measures in the 1970s. The DHM behaviour of the clones was observed both in the presence and absence of fish kairomone. Significant interclonal variation in DHM behaviour occurred in both treatments. To study the micro-evolutionary response of the Lake Ring D. magna population, two approaches were used. First, we compared the DHM behaviour of clones derived from ephippia collected at different depths. A comparison was conducted between clones resurrected from the period of eutrophication (1960-1980) and from the period of recovery (1986-2000). A significant treatment (presence and absence of fish kairomone) x period interaction effect was identified, suggesting a significant micro-evolutionary response for DHM behaviour. The D. magna clones exhibited a significantly stronger horizontal migration response during the period of eutrophication than in the recovery phase. Second, clonal means, representing the influence of the genotype on the trait, were correlated with environmental conditions (macrophyte cover, fish predation pressure and Secchi depth). The results of this analysis also suggest that a micro-evolutionary response by Daphnia has occurred in reaction to changes in fish predation pressure. In periods with high fish predation pressure, Daphnia migrated more strongly towards the plants.",10.1007/s10750-007-9086-1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

An organism's stoichiometry is thought to constrain its contribution to nutrient cycles (recycling or storage), and to limit its growth and reproduction. Factors that influence the stoichiometry of a consumer are largely unstudied, but what is known is that consumer stoichiometry is influenced by the elemental requirements of the consumer (e.g. for growth, reproduction and cell maintenance) and the availability of elements. We examined whole-body stoichiometry of larval southern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea cirrigera) and described the influence of location, body size, stoichiometry of diet items, and environmental nutrient supply on whole-body stoichiometry. Mean composition of phosphorous was 2.6%, nitrogen was 11.3%, and carbon was 39.6%, which are similar for other aquatic vertebrate taxa. The most significant predictor of whole-body stoichiometry was the site where the samples were collected, which was significant for each nutrient and nutrient ratio. Body size and stoichiometry of diet items were also predictors of Eurycea cirrigera stoichiometry. Our study suggests that spatial differences in environmental nutrient supply have a stronger influence on consumer whole-body stoichiometry among similar-sized larvae compared to life history traits, such as body size or diet.",10.1111/1749-4877.12114,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Currently, at least 22 alpha-diversity and 10 beta-diversity metrics of community phylogenetic structure can he combined with nine null models (eight for Ii-diversity metrics), providing 278 potentially distinct approaches to test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion. Selecting the appropriate approach for a study is daunting. First, we describe similarities among metrics and null models across variance in phylogeny size and shape, species abundance, and species richness. Second, we develop spatially explicit, individual-based simulations of neutral, competitive exclusion, or habitat filtering community assembly, and quantify the performance (type I and II error rates) of all 278 metric and null model combinations against each assembly process. Many a-diversity metrics and null models are at least functionally equivalent, reducing the number of truly unique metrics to 12 and the number of unique metric + null model combinations to 72. An even smaller subset of metric and null model combinations showed robust statistical performance. For a-diversity metrics, phylogenetic diversity' and mean nearest taxon distance were best able to detect habitat filtering, while mean pairwise phylogenetic distance-based metrics were best able to detect competitive exclusion. Overall, alpha-diversity metrics tended to have greater power to detect habitat filtering and competitive exclusion than a-diversity metrics, but had higher type 1 error in some cases. Across both alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, null model selection affected type I error rates more than metric selection. A null model that maintained species richness, and approximately maintained species occurrence frequency and abundance across sites, exhibited low type I and II error rates. This regional null model simulates neutral dispersal of individuals into local communities by sampling from a regional species pool.

Other approaches include model-based methods and weighted correlations of different metrics of trait-environment associations, the best known of which is the fourth-corner correlation method. We investigated these three general statistical approaches for trait-environment associations: CWMr, five weighted correlation metrics (Peres-Neto, Dray, & ter Braak, Ecography, 40, 806-816, 2017), and two multilevel models (MLM) using four different methods for computing p-values. We first compared the methods applied to a plant community dataset. To determine the validity of the statistical conclusions, we then performed a simulation study. CWMr gave highly significant associations for both traits, whereas the other methods gave a mix of support. CWMr had inflated type I errors for some simulation scenarios, implying that the significant results for the data could be spurious. The weighted correlation methods had generally good type I error control but had low power. One of the multilevel models, that from Jamil, Ozinga, Kleyer, and ter Braak (Journal of Vegetation Science, 24, 988-1000, 2013) had both good type I error control and high power when an appropriate method was used to obtain p-values. In particular, if there was no correlation among species in their abundances among sites, a parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test (LRT) gave the best power. When there was correlation among species in their abundances, a conditional parametric LRT had correct type I errors but had lower power. There is no overall best method for identifying trait-environment associations. For the simple task of testing associations between single environmental variables and single traits, the weighted correlations with permutation tests all had good type I error control, and their ease of implementation is an advantage. For the more complex task of multivariate analyses and model fitting, and when high statistical power is needed, we recommend MLM2 (Jamil et al., 2013). However, care must be taken to ensure against inflated type I errors for both weighted correlations and MLM2.

In particular, low intrinsic mortality risks on islands with reduced predator numbers and not subject to harsh winter climates may in principle support the development of stocks with extended longevity. Conversely, the conditions under which laboratory rodents are typically bred are thought to select for genotypes that produce large, rapidly maturing races with high early reproductive rates but diminished longevity. To test these ideas, and to generate new mouse stocks suitable for genetic and molecular analysis of the processes that time life-history events, we have developed specific pathogen-free stocks from mice trapped from three distinct populations: the U.S. mainland (Idaho) and the tropical Pacific islands Majuro and Pohnpei. Mice from all three locations were found to be shorter and lighter, to have smaller litters, and to have higher faecal corticosterone levels than mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock derived from four common laboratory inbred strains. Among the wild-derived stocks, mice from Pohnpei and Majuro were significantly lighter and shorter than Idaho-derived animals, even in populations kept from birth under identical housing conditions. Litter size and reproductive success rates did not differ significantly among the three wild-derived stocks.

We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300-2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses.

Accounting for traits at the individual level is an important advance in the implementation of trait-based approaches in understanding community structure and function. We incorporate individual- and species-level traits into one succinct assemblage structure metric, fractional size, which is calculated as the length of an individual divided by its potential maximum length. We test the implementation of fractional size in demersal fish assemblages along a depth gradient in the deep sea. We use data from an extensive trawl survey at depths of 300-2030m on the continental slope of the Rockall Trough, Northeast Atlantic, to compare changes in fractional size structure along an environmental gradient to those seen using traditional taxonomic and trait-based approaches. The relationship between fractional size and depth was particularly strong, with the overall pattern being an increase with depth, implying that individuals move deeper as they grow. Body size increased with depth at the intraspecific and assemblage levels. Fractional size, size structure and species composition all varied among assemblages, and this variation could be explained by the depth that the assemblage occupied. The inclusion of individual-level traits and population fractional size structure adds to our understanding at the assemblage level.

Analysis of variance techniques (n=43) was the most commonly applied method. Levene's tests (n=14), linear techniques (both general and generalized models) (n=12) and mixed effects modelling (n=9) were also used. Qualitative comparisons of plant phenotype using descriptive statistics (n=10) and coefficients of variation (n=8) were also applied. Bayesian analysis was used in a single study. We compared the efficacy and interpretation of analysis of variance, tests for homogeneity of variance, qualitative comparisons, mixed effects models and Bayesian hierarchical modelling in a case study measuring variation in specific leaf area (SLA) and rosette diameter among 10 populations (n=241 individuals) of Hypochaeris radicata. We also examined whether data base- and literature-based trait values provided good estimates for measured populations. Intraspecific variation was substantial, and significant differences existed in both means and variation across populations for both measured traits. There was a 27-fold variation in SLA (1 center dot 7-46 center dot 1mm(2) mg(-1)) and a 34-fold variation in rosette diameter (1 center dot 7-59 center dot 1cm). The choice of statistical technique influenced the interpretation of results. Permutational anova was reasonably successful in detecting differences among populations, particularly when combined with a permutational test of dispersion within populations. Only Bayesian estimates were able to simultaneously quantify and compare variation within and across populations and to estimate trait values and variation on a larger, regional scale. Literature-based trait values had poor fit for four of 10 populations and differed from the estimated regional trait distribution.Synthesis. Although both classical and Bayesian techniques yielded similar results, Bayesian techniques were more sensitive to differences in intraspecific variation, could simultaneously examine variation within and across populations, could estimate regional trait distributions and did not require that the assumption of homogeneity of variance be met.

We examined whether species occurring in ""core"" habitats (where they occur frequently, abundantly, and consistently) express traits that are nearer to ""optimum"", as captured by the community-weighted mean (CWM). We also asked whether trait variance showed signs of environmental filtering. We used cluster analysis to group plots based on environmental factors along a wet-to-dry ecotone. We used indicator species analysis to identify species with strong associations within each cluster. Trait means and variances were compared, and evidence of variance filtering was tested using a null-model approach. Trait means and trait variances respond to local-scale environmental filtering and species in core habitats were not necessarily nearer to the CWM than in other habitats. Intraspecific trait variability shows a strong signal of filtering, as variability was reduced for nearly all species and all traits compared to estimates of variability generated in the absence of environmental filtering.

We tested for the existence of spatially nested sets of trait-based filters in a temperate native grassland by applying the recently proposed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach to trait-based community assembly, which we extend through a trait selection procedure. We found that different traits were important in influencing the abundances of species at the three different spatial scales examined (micro-habitat, habitat, landscape), supporting the idea that trait based filtering processes operating at coarse spatial scales can be quite distinct from those operating at fine scales. Despite this result, we identified several traits which were frequently related to abundance at all spatial scales. Taken together, our results support the proposition that trait-based environmental filters at finer spatial scales are nested within those operating at coarser scales.

Then, we used the output model equations to estimate the probability of occurrence of the species as a function of forest canopy cover (i.e. response to forest loss), and quantified the phylogenetic signal in their responses using a molecular phylogeny. Most species showed a lower probability of occurrence when forest canopy cover in the plots (local scale) was low. However, the probability of occurrence of many species increased when forest canopy cover decreased across landscape scales. We detected a strong phylogenetic signal in species response to forest loss at local and small landscape (1.6 km) scales. However, phylogenetic signal was weak and non-significant at intermediate (3.2 km) and large (6.4 km) landscape scales. Our results suggest that phylogenetic information could be used to prioritize forested areas for conservation, since evolutionary history may largely determine species response to forest loss.

However, the analysis of the joint explanatory ability of multiple drivers (farmland breeding habitat, pole-most breeding latitude, migratory habit, FID) effects on population status replicated previously reported strong effects of farmland breeding habitat (an effect apparently driven mostly by European birds), as well as strong effects of FID, body size, migratory habit and continent. Farmland birds are generally declining.Conclusions/Significance: Flight initiation distance is related to population trends in a way that differs among continents opening new research possibilities concerning the causes of geographic differences in patterns of anti-predator behavior.",10.1371/journal.pone.0107883,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = flight initiation distance, farmland breeding habitat (Y/N), pole-most latitudinal rnage, migration behaviour, body mass",
"Moller, AP; Garamszegi, LZ",2012,Between individual variation in risk-taking behavior and its life history consequences,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Flight initiation distances (FIDs) of animals approached by a potential predator provide information about the risk that individuals are willing to take given their state and the environment. Species differ in mean and variance in FID, suggesting that species with a large variance in FID have individuals that take either small or great risks, whereas species with a small variance are composed of individuals that are homogeneous in their risk-taking behavior. Here, we investigate the correlations between interspecific variance in risk-taking behavior and habitat selection, breeding range and population size, dispersal, and life history. Greater between individual variation in risk-taking behavior for a given average level of risk taking would imply that more different habitats could be exploited, resulting in larger local and global population sizes and larger ranges. There should be a link between dispersal distances and FID because individuals of risk-averse species should encounter greater difficulties of finding suitable breeding habitats. High local and global population sizes should select for fast life histories with early age at first reproduction, high annual fecundity, low juvenile survival, and fast rates of senescence in species with variable FIDs. Finally, a greater diversity of habitat use should select for a longer reproductive season in species with more variable FIDs. Analyses of FIDs for 133 species of birds revealed results largely consistent with these predictions. Because risk taking correlates with other kinds of behavior that constitute a syndrome behavioral syndromes can play an important role in producing ecological syndromes (i.e., correlations between ecological traits).",10.1093/beheco/ars040,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Birds,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = flight initiation distance, habitat, breeding range size, natal dispersal distance, age at first reproduction, annual fecundity, juvenile survival rate, adult survival rate, senescence, duration of breeding season, body mass, ",

Costs arising from sexual selection could increase the intensity of predator-mediated natural selection, leading to the prediction that species with exaggerated secondary sexual characters should be particularly susceptible to predation. We tested this prediction in a comparative analysis based on 31,745 prey individuals belonging to 66 species of birds collected from a total of 93 7 breeding events by 3 3 to 66 different pairs of European sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus annually during a period of 21 years. To assess vulnerability of different species we estimated a prey vulnerability index based on the difference in the logarithmically transformed absolute abundance of prey minus the logarithmically transformed expected abundance as determined by population density of breeding birds. The prey vulnerability index was predicted by sexual dichromatism, accounting for 23% of the variance in risk of predation among species, even when considering similarity in phenotype among species due to common descent (in the latter case explaining 12% of the variance).

"Mondy, CP; Munoz, I; Doledec, S",2016,Life-history strategies constrain invertebrate community tolerance to multiple stressors: A case study in the Ebro basin,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Context: Multiple stressors constitute a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems, particularly in the Mediterranean region where water scarcity is likely to interact with other anthropogenic stressors. Biological traits potentially allow the unravelling of the effects of multiple stressors. However, thus far, trait-based approaches have failed to fully deliver on their promise and still lack strong predictive power when multiple stressors are present. Goal: We aimed to quantify specific community tolerances against six anthropogenic stressors and investigate the responses of the underlying macroinvertebrate biological traits and their combinations. Methods: We built and calibrated boosted regression tree models to predict community tolerances using multiple biological traits with a priori hypotheses regarding their individual responses to specific stressors. We analysed the combinations of traits underlying community tolerance and the effect of trait association on this tolerance. Results: Our results validated the following three hypotheses: (i) the community tolerance models efficiently and robustly related trait combinations to stressor intensities and, to a lesser extent, to stressors related to the presence of dams and insecticides; (ii) the effects of traits on community tolerance not only depended on trait identity but also on the trait associations emerging at the community level from the co-occurrence of different traits in species; and (iii) the community tolerances and the underlying trait combinations were specific to the different stressors. Conclusion: This study takes a further step towards predictive tools in community ecology that consider combinations and associations of traits as the basis of stressor tolerance. Additionally, the community tolerance concept has potential application to help stream managers in the decision process regarding management options. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Community ecology has developed a number of promising theories, including food webs, metabolic theory, ecological stoichiometry, and environmental filtering. Their joint implementation in a mechanistic modeling framework should help us to bring community ecology to a new level by improving its predictive abilities. One of the challenges lies in the proper consideration of model uncertainty. In this paper, we contribute to this challenging task by modeling the temporal dynamics of macro invertebrate communities in a stream subjected to hydropeaking in Switzerland. To this end, we extended the mechanistic model Streambugs regarding flood-induced drift processes and the use of trait information to define performance filters. Model predictions without any calibration were in the right order of magnitude but did not reflect the dynamics of most of the invertebrate taxa well. Bayesian inference drastically improved the model fit. It revealed that a large share of total model output uncertainty can be attributed to observation errors, which exceeded model parameter uncertainty. Observed and simulated community-aggregated traits helped to identify and understand model deficits. The combination of different ecological theories and trait information in a single mechanistic modeling framework combined with Bayesian inference can thus help to predict responses of communities to environmental changes, which can support ecosystem management.",10.1002/eap.1530,Y,0,1,0,0,0,1,Multiple,Freshwater,Insects,Stream,1,1,1,1,1,Multiple,4,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits  = metabolic rate, body size, habitat, diet",

Relative influences of these processes should vary according to habitat features and dispersal. Species dispersion within assemblage trait space also should vary in relation to species richness, strength of competition, and the spatiotemporal scale of analysis. We examined ecomorphological diversity of two freshwater fish families (Neotropical Cichlidae, Nearctic Centrarchidae) to test theories of local assembly from regional species pools and theories of species packing within mesohabitat patches. Cichlid and centrarchid assemblages were surveyed in four floodplain rivers (two in South America and two in North America) during low-water periods when fish densities are highest. Surveys were conducted in four mesohabitat types (submerged wood, leaf litter, rocks, sand bank) within river channels and floodplain lakes. We measured 23 morphological traits associated with locomotion and feeding. Principal components analysis was performed on the species x traits matrix, and species axis scores were used to calculate species pairwise Euclidean distances and indices of dispersion within assemblage morphospace: mean nearest-neighbor distance (indicating similarity), mean distance to centroid (assemblage morphospace size), and standard deviation of nearest-neighbor distance (evenness of dispersion within assemblage morphospace). A null model was used to assess whether patterns were significantly nonrandom. When data for all mesohabitat types were combined for each river, species were significantly overdispersed and the assemblage morphospace was larger than predicted at random in every case. Analysis of assemblages within mesohabitat patches of different types revealed, in every case, significant overdispersion of species in morphospace indicative of limiting similarity. The total assemblage morphospace was greater than expected for tropical cichlids, but not for temperate centrarchids. Trends of species dispersion with assemblage morphospace in relation to species richness within mesohabitat patches were not consistent among or within river systems, possibly indicating that patches were already saturated with these perciform fishes. Interregional comparisons suggest an influence from both adaptive diversification and environmental filtering at broad spatial scales. At the scale of mesohabitat patches in lowland rivers, cichlid and centrarchid assemblages revealed patterns of trait complementarity that imply limiting similarity and strong influence of biotic interactions.",10.1890/13-0708.1,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = used traits to create morphospace,

The evolutionary origin of spines is considered as a defensive mechanism in Panacanthus; both morphological and behavioural (i.e. acoustic) traits allow inferences about relationships. Phylogenetic analysis produced one most parsimonious cladogram eighty-two steps long, with the ensemble consistency index=0.84. Panacanthus cuspidatus and P. pallicornis (formerly Storniza Walker 1869, Martinezia Bolivar 1881) are properly incorporated in Panacanthus. On morphology, Panacanthus is more related to the Neotropical Copiphora and Lirometopum than to the Old World Lesina. Character analysis reveals that in Panacanthus the ancestral condition of calling song resonance (the production of musical sounds) has given rise to a more nonresonant (transient) stridulation. A correlation between the production of more complex sound waves and spinous protection of the body (especially the pronotum) is noted. Because early workers grouped Panacanthus with other spiny genera, based on pronotal morphology, we present a critique of the evolutionary and ecological implications of the development of defensive spines in this genus. This approach may be applied to other taxa using a similar protective mechanism. We advise against arrangement of the pronotal, cephalic and femoral armature as a homologous characteristic across subfamilies. Several pronotal processes and modifications evolved independently in other genera of Conocephalinae, Hetrodinae, Pseudophyllinae and Phaneropterinae. The pronotal structure of Panacanthus is unique and may be taken as a synapomorphic characteristic of all its species and as an autapomorphic feature of the genus.",10.1111/j.1365-3113.2004.00223.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. 'community structure') reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species' large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.",10.1371/journal.pone.0197877,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

LocationSoutheast region of Brazil. MethodsWe classified tree species found in a total of 40 forest sites (18 primary, 11 restored, 11 secondary) according to pollination mode, based on the literature. We calculated and compared functional dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness between forest types. ResultsFunctional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20%, >80%, respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee, wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination, whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and small insect pollination. ConclusionsOur results indicate a rather stable assemblage of pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes, and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in plant-pollinator interactions.",10.1111/avsc.12335,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Mooij, WM; DeAngelis, DL",1999,Individual-based modelling as an integrative approach in theoretical and applied population dynamics and food web studies,HERBIVORES: BETWEEN PLANTS AND PREDATORS,"Traditional modelling approaches in population dynamics and food web studies do not incorporate the basic biological principles that each individual is different and that interactions between individuals are inherently local. This notion has led to the development of so-called individual-based models of populations and communities. A population or community is described as a database of individuals, whereby each individual is described in a number of traits and a number of processes that change these traits over time. This approach allows for incorporating significantly more detail compared with unstructured and physiologically structured models. Nowadays, the individual-based approach is widely applied in both animal and plant ecology. These applications, of which some representative examples are briefly described in this chapter, show that individual-based models can be used to bridge the gap between theoretical studies that focus on general features of ecosystems and applied studies that are designed to predict the dynamics of ecosystems under management scenarios. Individual-based models can contribute to theoretical studies because they accommodate small but biologically relevant detail, which cannot be included in analytical models. In applied studies, they have proven to be quite flexible in using those data that are typically available from field studies. The advantages of individual-based modelling come at the cost of technical and numerical complexity, necessary to cope with the numerous book-keeping operations that individual-based models essentially come down to. Various frameworks are now available to enhance the development of individual-based models. We expect individual-based models to become established as a standard tool in ecological research within the near future because the individual-based modelling paradigm provides a general structure of the formalization and analysis of community and food web dynamics.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We identify two challenges for making further progress in this field. One such challenge is to avoid developing more models largely following the concept of others ('reinventing the wheel'). The other challenge is to avoid focusing on only one type of model, while ignoring new and diverse approaches that have become available ('having tunnel vision'). In this paper, we aim at improving the awareness of existing models and knowledge of concurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, without covering all possible model tools and avenues. First, we present a broad variety of modelling approaches. To illustrate these approaches, we give brief descriptions of rather arbitrarily selected sets of specific models. We deal with static models (steady state and regression models), complex dynamic models (CAEDYM, CE-QUAL-W2, Delft 3D-ECO, LakeMab, LakeWeb, MyLake, PCLake, PROTECH, SALMO), structurally dynamic models and minimal dynamic models. We also discuss a group of approaches that could all be classified as individual based: super-individual models (Piscator, Charisma), physiologically structured models, stage-structured models and traitbased models. We briefly mention genetic algorithms, neural networks, Kalman filters and fuzzy logic. Thereafter, we zoom in, as an in-depth example, on the multi-decadal development and application of the lake ecosystem model PCLake and related models (PCLake Metamodel, Lake Shira Model, IPH-TRIM3D-PCLake). In the discussion, we argue that while the historical development of each approach and model is understandable given its 'leading principle', there are many opportunities for combining approaches. We take the point of view that a single 'right' approach does not exist and should not be strived for. Instead, multiple modelling approaches, applied concurrently to a given problem, can help develop an integrative view on the functioning of lake ecosystems. We end with a set of specific recommendations that may be of help in the further development of lake ecosystem models.",10.1007/s10452-010-9339-3,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In a three-year factorial experiment, I investigated whether the effects of birds on pine and its arthropods differed based on the presence of ants that were predators of most arthropods, but mutualists with tended aphid species. Birds and ants reduced the abundance of most herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods in an additive fashion, with the effects of ants being stronger than those of birds. In sharp contrast, the opposing influences of birds and ants on tended aphid species interacted strongly; ants only increased tended aphid abundance in the absence of birds, while birds only reduced their abundance in the presence of ants. This interaction was mirrored in total herbivore abundance because tended aphids dominated the herbivore community. I develop a novel lexicon to discuss the emergent properties from these effects of opposing sign (predation, mutualism). Despite having emergent effects on herbivores, birds indirectly increased pine wood and foliage growth to a similar extent whether or not ants were present, while ants had no detectable effects. Birds also indirectly increased the abundance of some pine phloem monoterpenes, but these effects differed based on the presence or absence of ants. Thus, I report on a novel yet possibly widespread indirect interaction between intraguild predators, herbivore mutualists, and plant traits (growth, secondary chemistry) mediated through a species-rich community of arthropods.",10.1890/06-1095.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Moore, Christine; Grewar, John; Cumming, Graeme S.",2016,Quantifying network resilience: comparison before and after a major perturbation shows strengths and limitations of network metrics,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. The resilience literature often assumes that social-ecological reorganization will result in either the removal of deficient system elements (components, interactions) or social learning. Major perturbations are expected to lead to either adaptation or, if accompanied by a regime shift, transformation. This has led to a conflation of the concepts of resilience and adaptation, which has in turn made it difficult to quantitatively distinguish between cases in which a system returned to a previous state, and adaptation or learning occurred, and cases in which the system was resilient but adaptation or learning did not occur.2. We used a network analysis of nine years of ostrich movement data to explore the socialecological resilience of the Western Cape ostrich industry, which nearly collapsed following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2011 and has gradually rebuilt.3. The system that emerged following the outbreak contained fewer farms but was more connected than at any period prior to the outbreak. As system reorganization proceeded, network traits began to fluctuate seasonally and to approach values similar to those observed prior to the outbreak. It was estimated that it would take 4-5 full seasonal cycles for the system to return to a similar state to that prior to the disease outbreak. In other words, although the system reorganized following the system collapse, it remained within the same regime and showed no obvious evidence of adaptation or learning.4. Policy implications. The majority of previous work on studying system response to disturbance has focused on outcome-based adaptation and learning. This study highlights the need to understand systems that respond to disturbance without learning or adaptation. Network analysis offers a useful quantitative tool for exploring social-ecological resilience and tracking changes in vulnerability. However, the development of better ways of incorporating additional data from multiple scales into network analysis remains an important priority for improving the predictive power and policy relevance of network approaches to analysing resilience.",10.1111/1365-2664.12486,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Moore, J; Gotelli, NJ",1996,Evolutionary patterns of altered behavior and susceptibility in parasitized hosts,EVOLUTION,"Adaptation is the usual context for interpreting parasite-host interactions. For example, altered host behavior is often interpreted as a parasite adaptation, because in some cases it enhances parasite transmission. Resistance to parasites also has obvious adaptive value for hosts. However, it is difficult to evaluate the adaptive significance of host-parasite interactions without considering the historical context in which these traits have evolved and if they can be predicted by host (or parasite) phylogeny. We examined the influence of host phylogeny on patterns of altered behavior and resistance to parasitism in a cockroach-acanthocephalan system. A consensus cladogram for cockroach subfamilies was produced from the morphological data of McKittrick. We used this cladogram to predict patterns of altered host behavior in seven cockroach host species. Each species was experimentally infected with a single species of acanthocephalan, Moniliformis moniliformis, a parasite that is transmitted when cockroaches are eaten by rodent final hosts. Activity patterns, substrate choices, and responses to light were measured for control and infected animals. These data were recoded into a behavioral matrix of discrete characters. We determined the most parsimonious distribution of the behavioral characters on the tree obtained from McKittrick's data. We then measured the concordance between the behavioral data and the cockroach cladogram with the consistency index (CI). We compared the observed CI to the expected value based on a randomization of observed character states. For three different models of evolutionary character change, there was no evidence of strong concordance (significantly large CI) between altered host behavior and host relationships. Parsimony analysis of the interior nodes of the phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that unaltered behavior was the ancestral state for most host behaviors. We also compared host phylogeny to a data set on the susceptibility of 29 cockroach species to infection with M. moniliformis. At the species level, there was a significant concordance between susceptibility and host phylogeny. This pattern was consistent with the finding that susceptibility of species varied significantly among different subfamilies. However, at the subfamily level, susceptibility was not strongly concordant with phylogeny. We predict that, given enough time, resistance should be lost in subfamilies that are currently resistant to parasitism. In spite of the potential importance of phylogeny in the evolution of behavior and susceptibility, we found little evidence for phylogenetic effects in this system. We conclude that changes in the behavioral responses of hosts to parasites and, to a lesser extent, changes in susceptibility are more frequent than cockroach speciation events in different cockroach lineages. This finding strengthens the assertion that at least some of the altered behaviors are adaptive for host and/or parasite.",10.2307/2410853,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We evaluated divergence in offspring size, offspring number, and the trade-off between these traits using a meta-analysis in livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae). Life-history divergence was consistent and predictable to some (predation, hydrogen sulphide) but not all (density, food limitation, salinity) selective agents. In contrast, magnitudes of divergence among selective agents were similar. Finally, there was a negative, asymmetric relationship between offspring-number and offspring-size divergence, suggesting greater costs of increasing offspring size than number.

"Mori, Akira S.",2018,Environmental controls on the causes and functional consequences of tree species diversity,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Knowledge of the functional consequences of biodiversity is increasing through studies of both experimental systems and natural systems. Community assembly theory has also helped to reveal the causes of biodiversity organization. However, the causes and consequences of biodiversity have been discussed in parallel and simultaneous consideration of both has been limited, even though they are both influenced by regional environmental conditions. To understand the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, I focused on the linkages between the number of tree species and biomass productivity across forest biomes under a range of bioclimatic conditions. I found that high tree diversity generally increased productivity. This was primarily due to a selection process that results from a high probability of having high-performance species and their dominance at high diversity, regardless of the biome. In less-productive biomes, the residual importance of diversity, which likely reflects other forms of biological interactions (including species complementarity), increased productivity. These findings of differential diversity effects under different environmental conditions are consistent with the existing theory of community assembly, which predicts a shift in the assembly process from stochasticity to determinism with increasing environmental harshness. Analyses based on functional trait diversity also supported this theory: stochastic assembly (resulting in the selection effect) and deterministic assembly (possibly resulting from interspecific niche differences) became more important in productive and less-productive biomes, respectively.Synthesis. Increasing our understanding of the causalities between diversity and other characteristics, such as productivity, is crucial, particularly for forest ecosystems, because of the increasing interest in productivity-related ecosystem services supported by diverse assemblages of trees.",10.1111/1365-2745.12851,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = girth at breast height, life form, ",

Here, we explore relationships between species' local coexistence and their trophic niches in terms of their feeding relationships both as consumers and as resources. We build on recent concepts and methods from community phylogenetics to develop a framework for analysing mechanisms responsible for community composition using trophic similarity among species and null models of community assembly. We apply this framework to 50 food webs found in 50 Adirondack lakes and find that species composition in these communities appears to be driven by both bottom-up effects by which the presence of prey species selects for predators of those prey, and top-down effects by which prey more tolerant of predation out-compete less tolerant prey of the same predators. This approach to community food webs is broadly applicable and shows how species interaction networks can inform an increasingly large array of theory central to community ecology.",10.1111/ele.12356,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,,
"Morris, DW",2018,Site-specific plasticity and demography determine litter size in a population of white-footed mice,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,"Background: Despite heritable variation and positive selection gradients, the mean number of young that a female produces often fails to increase through time. This paradox can be resolved by mapping fitness as a manifestation of heritable variation, direct and indirect selection on traits, and environmental interactions with demography. Questions: Does environmental variation in time and space determine the outcome of selection on litter size? Is the pattern of variation consistent with our understanding of the fitness map? Study organism: White-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, reproducing in nest boxes in southern Ontario, Canada. Methods: I analysed 35-years' data on litter-size variation at two nearby study sites and interpreted the results in the context of the fitness-mapping function. Analyses: Linear regression, mixed models, generalized linear models, model selection, mean-standardized selection gradients. Results: There was no detectable cost of reproduction. Mean annual litter sizes did not vary at one site where shallow selection gradients were associated with small spring litters. Those litters yielded higher recruitment than larger litters born in autumn. The other site was different: mean litter size increased marginally from year to year and recruitment was higher for large autumn litters than for smaller litters produced in spring. Conclusions: Spatial variation in apparent selection on white-footed mouse litter size is associated with site-specific, demographically induced seasonal differences in recruitment success. Failure to incorporate such relevant environmental clines can lead to biased interpretations of selection and misunderstanding of the lock-step connection between ecology and evolution.",unkown_16,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Mammals,Temperate Forest,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = litter size  ,

Ascertaining the relative importance of environmental factors can, however, be difficult given the numerous mechanisms through which they affect individuals. This is especially true in dynamic and complex estuarine environments. Here, we develop long-term otolith-based indices of recruitment and growth for estuary perch Percalates colonorum (Bemm River, Australia), to explore the importance of intrinsic (individual, demographic) and extrinsic (hydrologic, climatic, density-dependent) factors in driving estuarine fish productivity. Analyses involved a novel zero-inflated specification of catch curve regression and mixed effects modelling. The 39years of recruitment and 46years of growth data, spanning a period of environmental change including severe drought, displayed considerable inter-annual variation. Recruitment success was strongly related to high freshwater inflows during the spawning season, suggesting that these conditions act as spawning cues for adults and potentially provide favourable conditions for larvae. Individuals displayed age-dependent growth, with highest rates observed at younger ages in years characterized by warm temperatures, and to a lesser degree, greater magnitude base inflow conditions. We detected systematic among-year-class growth differences, but these were not attributable to year class strength, suggesting that environmental conditions experienced by individuals as juveniles can have long-lasting effects of greater importance to population productivity than density-dependent growth responses. The primacy of temperature in driving growth variation highlights that under-appreciated climatic variation can affect estuarine fish productivity through direct physiological and indirect food web mechanisms. We predict that climatic warming will promote individual growth in southerly populations of P. colonorum but concurrently limit recruitment due to forecast reductions in spawning season river discharge. Disparate trait responses are likely in other fishes as they respond to multiple and changing environmental drivers, making predictions of future population productivity challenging.",10.1111/gcb.12545,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = recruitment, growth rate",
"Mortensen, Brent; Abbott, Karen C.; Danielson, Brent",2018,Defensive tradeoffs are not prerequisites to plant diversity in a two species model,OIKOS,"Trait-based theories of biodiversity consider interspecific tradeoffs among species-specific traits as prerequisites to maintaining community evenness, a component of species diversity. Such tradeoffs are commonly observed in plant communities, particularly in relation to traits associated with resistance to herbivory. Indeed, global experiments show that interspecific tradeoffs are common between plant defense and growth or competitive ability; however, the positive effects of herbivory on plant diversity predicted by theories with trait-based tradeoffs are far less commonly observed. Moreover, both the overall and relative importance of these tradeoffs in promoting plant diversity are not well known. To disentangle the relationships among growth, competition, and defense in relation to plant community evenness, we built a model that describes the effects of a shared herbivore on two plant species with the potential to differ in each of these traits. While tradeoffs between plant defense and growth or competitive ability can increase plant diversity via evenness, this is not always the case nor is it a requirement for increased diversity. Herbivores may increase plant diversity even in the absence of defensive tradeoffs, preferentially consuming apparently maladapted species, by limiting the negative effects of interspecific interactions. Therefore, the importance of defensive tradeoffs in increasing diversity may not be as important, or as straightforward, as previously hypothesized.",10.1111/oik.04300,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,0,0,1,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits  = defense investment, plant growth",

However, as species are embedded in an ecological network characterised by multiple consumer-resource interactions, ecological mismatches are likely to arise when interacting species do not respond homogeneously. The approach of biological networks analysis calls for the use of structural equation modelling (SEM), a multidimensional analytical setup that has proven particularly useful for analysing multiple interactions across trophic levels. Here we apply SEM to a long-term dataset from a High-Arctic ecosystem to analyse how phenological responses across three trophic levels are coupled to snowmelt patterns and how changes may cascade through consumer-resource interactions. Specifically, the model included the effect of snowmelt on a High-Arctic tri-trophic system of flowers, insects and waders (Charadriiformes), with latent factors representing phenology (timing of life history events) and performance (abundance or reproduction success) for each trophic level. The effects derived from the model demonstrated that the time of snowmelt directly affected plant and arthropod phenology as well as the performance of all included trophic levels. Additionally, timing of snowmelt appeared to indirectly influence wader phenology as well as plant, arthropod and wader performance through effects on adjacent trophic levels and lagged effects.

We used a set of four experiments to demonstrate that the influence of release strategies on short-term reintroduction outcomes is related to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We compared different reintroduction strategies for three mammal species in an arid environment where exotic mammalian predators were removed. Wild greater stick-nest rats selected vegetation shelter sites with greater structural density than captive-bred rats, travelled further from the release site and experienced lower rates of mortality. In comparison, there was no difference in mortality or movement between wild and captive-bred greater bilbies. Burrowing bettongs and greater bilbies were also subjected to immediate and delayed release strategies and whilst no difference was detected in bilbies, bettongs that were subjected to delayed releases lost less weight and took less time to establish burrows than those that were immediately released. Interspecific differences in treatment response were attributed to predation risk, the nature of the release site, and behavioural traits such as shelter investment and sociality. Our varied results highlight the inadequacies of review articles focusing on optimum release protocols due to their attempt to generalise across species and release sites. We provide an example of a predictive model to guide future release strategy experimentation that recognises the range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing reintroduction outcomes. We encourage researchers to treat programs experimentally, identify individual site and species characters that may influence release strategies and record data on movements, mortality, weight dynamics, and settling times and distances. The inherent issues of small sample size and low statistical power that plague most reintroduction experiments suggests there is also a need for increased standardisation and publication of data sets to enable appropriate meta-analyses to occur.",10.1371/journal.pone.0099753,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Short-term experiments cannot characterize how long-lived, invasive shrubs influence ecological properties that can be slow to change, including native diversity and soil fertility. Observational studies are thus necessary, but often suffer from methodological issues. 2. To highlight ways of improving the design and interpretation of observational studies that assess the impacts of invasive plants, we compare two studies of nutrient cycling and earthworms along two separate gradients of invasive shrub abundance. By considering the divergent sampling strategies and statistical analyses of these two studies, and interpreting their contradictory results in the context of other studies, we also aim to better describe the impacts of the focal invader, Rhamnus cathartica. 3. In a new study of a single site in Minnesota, we observed positive correlations-between buckthorn abundance and soil pH, soil nutrient pools, nutrient fluxes through leaf litterfall, earthworm abundance and root biomass. Multiple regression models showed these relationships persisted after accounting for variability in soil texture and tree species composition. For a separate, more expansive study in Illinois, other authors reported little to no correlation between buckthorn abundance and 10 soil properties, including earthworm abundance, pH and nutrient concentrations. However, like many other studies, their regression models only assessed predictors related to invader abundance. R-2-values for models of ecosystem properties ranged from 0 to .79 (adjusted-R-2) for our study in Minnesota and from <.05 to .16 (unadjusted) for the prior study in Illinois. 4. Differences in sampling error and use of predictor variables between the two studies likely explain the contrasting results. 5. Synthesis and applications. To reduce the uncertainty of conclusions from observational studies of invasive plants, future studies must ensure that heterogeneity of soils and vegetation is adequately accounted for in the sampling strategy and statistical analyses (e.g. analysis of covariance, multiple regression). Particular attention should be given to ecosystem properties with variability that likely predates the invader (e.g. geophysical features and tree community composition). In our study, effects of buckthorn on ecosystem properties were not only robust to the inclusion of potentially confounding predictors, but also consistent with expectations based on ecological stoichiometry and mass balance of element flow.",10.1111/1365-2664.13075,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Instead, evolution is constrained by the set of available and viable phenotypes. In particular, natural selection may only favour a narrow range of adaptive optima constrained within selective regimes. Here, I integrate data with theory to test whether selection explains phenotypic constraint. A global database of 599 plant species from 94 families shows that stomatal ratio, a trait affecting photosynthesis and defence against pathogens, is highly constrained. Most plants have their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but species with half their stomata on each surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. A model based on a trade-off between maximizing photosynthesis and a fitness cost of upper stomata predicts a limited number of adaptive solutions, leading to a multimodal trait distribution. Phylogenetic comparisons show that amphistomy is the most common among fast-growing species, supporting the view that CO2 diffusion is under strong selection.

This synthesis considers carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus-related traits, the abundance of component species and their size distribution across trophic levels under different forms of management. We have analysed existing and novel databases on plants, microbes and invertebrates that combine physico-chemical and biological information from (agro)ecosystems spanning the globe. We found (1) evidence that traits from above- and below-ground systems may be integrated in the same model and (2) a much greater than expected stoichiometric plasticity of plants and microbes which has implications for the entire food-web mass abundance scaling. Nitrogen and phosphorus are primary basal resources (hence, drivers) and more retranslocation of P than of N from leaves will lead to higher N:P in the litter and soil organic matter. Thus, under nutrient-rich conditions, higher foliar concentrations of N and P are reflected by lower N:P in the brown litter, suggesting less P retranslocated than N. This apparent stoichiometric dichotomy between green and brown could result in shifts in threshold elemental ratios critical for ecosystem functioning. It has important implications for a general food-web model, given that resource C:N:P ratios are generally assumed to reflect environmental C:N:P ratios. We also provide the first evidence for large-scale allometric changes according to the stoichiometry of agroecosystems.

Given the importance of traits as predictors of niche complementarity and community structures, we (1) examine how the diversity sensu lato of forest trees, freshwater fishes and soil invertebrates might support ecosystem functioning and (2) discuss the relevance of productive biota for monophyletic assemblages (taxocenes). In terrestrial ecosystems, correlating traits to abiotic factors is complicated by the appropriate choice of body-size distributions. Angiosperm and gymnosperm trees, for example, show metabolic incongruences in their respiration rates despite their pronounced macroecological scaling. Scaling heterotrophic organisms within their monophyletic assemblages seems more difficult than scaling autotrophs: in contrast to the generally observed decline of mass-specific metabolic rates with body mass within metazoans, soil organisms such as protozoans show opposite mass-specific trends. At the community level, the resource demand of metazoans shapes multitrophic interactions. Hence, population densities and their food web relationships reflect functional diversity, but the influence of biodiversity on stability and ecosystem functioning remains less clear. We focused on fishes in 18 riverine food webs, where the ratio of primary versus secondary extinctions (hereafter, 'extinction partitioning') summarizes the responses of fish communities to primary species loss (deletions) and its consequences. Based on extinction partitioning, our high-diversity food webs were just as (or even more) vulnerable to extinctions as low-diversity food webs.

There is thus an urgent need to assess differences in the ability of plants to withstand water stress, especially when selecting appropriate species for ecological intervention. This study focuses on Mediterranean type ecosystems (MTEs) and identifies plant traits associated with drought resistance that are key in differ. entiating plant functional types in relation to water use. We further discuss how this knowledge can be used by restoration practitioners. The study was conducted in the Banksia woodlands, Southwestern Australia, and six areas across a gradient of water availability were selected. We measured twelve functional traits associated with water use in fifteen plant species. Next, we applied multivariate analyses to examine how traits varied in relation to each other, grouping species based on these traits and investigating similarities within and between functional groups and sites. Functional trait correlations were consistent with the worldwide leaf and wood economic spectra. Among the twelve traits measured, six explained most trait variation: mean xylem vessel diameter (D-ave), number of xylem vessels per mm(-2) (D-B, leaf mass per area (LMA), stem density (WD), foliar carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), and leaf water potential at turgor loss point (pi(TNPL)). Species were clustered into five different functional groups. Differences within and between functional groups and sites are reported through their Euclidean distances. Analyses of these traits provided insights into the water-use strategies of native plants, revealing those species with greatest potential to resist water deficits. Such knowledge enables the formation of a more functionally diverse assembly of species bearing complementary traits, which in turn can be used to strengthen resistance to invasion in restored communities.

While most studies have examined the influence of one or a few social and ecological factors on fitness traits, comprehensive analyses jointly testing the relative importance of each of many factors are rare. We investigated how a multitude of environmental and social conditions simultaneously affected reproductive performance and local recruitment of the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio (L.). Specifically, we tested hypotheses relating to timing of breeding, parental quality, nest predation, nest site selection, territory quality, intraspecific density and weather. Using model selection procedures, predictions of each hypothesis were first analysed separately, before a full model was constructed including variables selected in the single-hypothesis tests. From 1988 to 1992, 50% of 332 first clutches produced at least one fledgling, while 38.7% of 111 replacement clutches were successful. Timing of breeding, nest site selection, predation pressure, territory quality and intraspecific density influenced nest success in the single-hypothesis tests. The full model revealed that nest success was negatively associated with laying date, intraspecific density, and year, while nest success increased with nest concealment. Number of fledglings per successful nest was only influenced by nest concealment: better-camouflaged nests produced more fledglings. Probability of local recruitment was related to timing of breeding, parental quality and territory quality in the single-hypothesis tests. The full models confirmed the important role of territory quality for recruitment probability. Our results suggest that reproductive performance, and particularly nest success, of the red-backed shrike is primarily affected by timing of breeding, nest site selection, and intraspecific density.

However, species loss from human pressure is not random but depends on a series of environmentally associated factors. Linking species traits to environmental attributes may allow us to detect the ecological impacts of habitat so that meaningful habitat degradation gradients can be identified. The relationships between environmental factors and species traits provide the basis for identifying those biological traits that make species more sensitive to disturbance. These relationships are also helpful to detect the geographic distribution of latent risk to reveal areas where biodiversity is threatened. Here, we identify a ""Human Impact Gradient for Biodiversity (HIGB)'' based on a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) and fourth-corner analysis to identify key species traits that are associated with environmental gradient. Species distribution and environmental geographic data were gathered nationwide to analyze 68 localities, which represent 27% of Mexico's surface, including 211 species of mammals. Nine environmental variables (including biophysical, geophysical and landuse impacts) were analyzed by using the Geographic Information System. Three types of species' traits were evaluated: locomotion, trophic habit and body size. We identified a human impact gradient, which was mainly determined by the percentage of the area that was covered by seedlings, the plant richness, the understory coverage percentage and the human settlement index. The most important species traits that are associated with non-human-impacted sites were carnivores, frugivores-herbivores and a body size that was greater than 17.8 kg; 25 species were selected by the decision criteria framework for species that were sensitive to degradation based on ecological function information. Conversely, granivores, fossorial and semifossorial traits were associated with highly impacted sites. The environmental attributes were mapped to highlight the spatial patterns of human risk for species. Finally, we highlighted the need to apply science-based monitoring to future research based on the decision criteria framework for selecting species that are sensitive to degradation.

At large spatial scales and for species-rich systems, this question can be answered by studying functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns. The greater availability of community composition surveys, functional trait data bases and/or phylogenies from across a wide range of ecosystems has led to a significant increase in studies based on the analysis of diversity patterns. However, the underlying conceptual and methodological assumptions have recently been put into question, requiring rigorous evaluation of their reliability. In order to test these underlying assumptions, we need to be able to compare diversity patterns with their true underlying processes. For empirical data, we usually do not know these underlying processes, but for virtual data generated by simulation models, this information is available. Using two illustrative examples, we introduce VirtualCom, a simulation model that generates such data sets. Integrating both ecological and evolutionary processes, VirtualCom simulates the evolution of the pool of regionally occurring species, the process-based assembly of native communities and the invasion of novel species into native communities. The model provides functionalities for a variety of processes. Most importantly, in the simulation of the species pool, different trait evolution models allow the generation of clustered and random trait distributions in the phylogeny (resulting in varying strength of phylogenetic signal). Additionally, when the species assemble from the species pool into local communities based on their trait values, the relative strength of environmental filtering and competition can be set independently. By offering possibilities for a broad range of simulation-based modelling experiments, VirtualCom is a simple and readily usable tool that will help to resolve theoretical and methodological issues in community ecology.",10.1111/2041-210X.12364,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheifs Cmean and Pagels ? performed well and substantially better than Morans I and Blombergs K. Pagels ? provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheifs Cmean. Blombergs K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.",10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00196.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Environmental filtering weights the probability of immigration success depending on trait values, while the descendants of established immigrants undergo neutral stochastic drift. The reference pool can be defined in a flexible way as representing, e.g. the composition of a broad biogeographical region, or available dispersers around local communities. The package provides a process-based alternative to the use of randomization-based null models. The package proposes a coalescent-based simulation algorithm that presents significant advantages over alternative algorithms. It does not require simulating community dynamics from an initial state forward in time but does still allow measurement of the influence of environmental filtering. Because of its high calculation speed, this approach allows simulating many communities within a reasonable amount of time.

Although establishing the adaptive significance of polyploidy to explain the geographic distribution of cytotypes is challenging, the occurrence of different cytotypes in different ecological niches may suggest an adaptive role of genome duplication. We studied the adaptive significance of the geographic distribution of cytotypes across the entire distribution range of the endemic Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). For that, we have used climate variables, population elevation and soil properties to model ecological niches for the different cytotypes. In addition, we analysed the effect that ploidy level has on the floral phenotype. We found a clear geographic pattern in the distribution of cytotypes, with diploid individuals occurring in the southernmost part of the distribution range, while tetraploids were found in the northern area. A contact (mosaic) zone between both cytotypes was identified, but diploids and tetraploids occur in sympatry in only one population (although in a highly unbalanced proportion). Gene flow between different cytotypes seems to be negligible, as evident from an almost complete absence of triploids and other minority cytotypes. Niches occupied by both cytotypes showed subtle, but significant differences, even in the contact zone. Precipitation was higher in regions occupied by tetraploid individuals, which present wider corolla tubes and thinner but taller stalks than diploids. Our findings highlight the potential role of polyploidy in the ecological adaptation of E.mediohispanicum to both abiotic factors and biotic interactions.",10.1111/plb.12605,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In this context, there is a need for tools to share knowledge on the ecosystem effects of fisheries among these stakeholders. When managing bottom trawl fisheries under an EAF framework, one of the main concerns is the direct and indirect consequences of trawling impacts on benthic ecosystems. We developed a platform using the ExtendSim (R) software with a user-friendly interface that combines a simulation model based on existing knowledge, data collection and representation of predicted trawling impacts on the seabed. The platform aims to be a deliberation support tool for fisheries' stakeholders and, simultaneously, raise public awareness of the need for good benthic community knowledge to appropriately inform EAF management plans. The simulation procedure assumes that trawling affects benthic communities with an intensity that depends on the level of fishing effort exerted on benthic communities and on the habitat characteristics (i.e. sediment grain size). Data to build the simulation comes from epifaunal samples from 18 study sites located in Mediterranean continental shelves subjected to different levels of fishing effort. In this work, we present the simulation outputs of a 50% fishing effort increase (and decrease) in four of the study sites which cover different habitats and different levels of fishing effort. We discuss the platform strengths and weaknesses and potential future developments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Biological sciences,"The determinants of the structure, functioning and resilience of pelagic ecosystems across most of the polar regions are not well known. Improved understanding is essential for assessing the value of biodiversity and predicting the effects of change (including in biodiversity) on these ecosystems and the services they maintain. Here we focus on the trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem structure, developing comparative analyses of how polar pelagic food webs vary in relation to the environment. We highlight that there is not a singular, generic Arctic or Antarctic pelagic food web, and, although there are characteristic pathways of energy flow dominated by a small number of species, alternative routes are important for maintaining energy transfer and resilience. These more complex routes cannot, however, provide the same rate of energy flow to highest trophic-level species. Food-web structure may be similar in different regions, but the individual species that dominate mid-trophic levels vary across polar regions. The characteristics (traits) of these species are also different and these differences influence a range of food-web processes. Low functional redundancy at key trophic levels makes these ecosystems particularly sensitive to change. To develop models for projecting responses of polar ecosystems to future environmental change, we propose a conceptual framework that links the life histories of pelagic species and the structure of polar food webs.",10.1098/rspb.2016.1646,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,didn’t actually test the question,

We found evidence that directional selection favors increased plant size, consistent with hypotheses of plant responses to novel environments. However, selection differed among plants with fungus gnat larvae damage, aphid damage, and plants that escaped herbivory, evidence that the selective landscape is variable and complex even for quasi-natural field plots.

Here, we conducted ecological and evolutionary analyses of communities of caddisflies in the genus Hydropsyche (Insecta: Trichoptera) composed of ecomorphologically differentiated species. Location River ecosystems in the Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco. Methods Nineteen environmental variables were assessed at 180 local study sites and species presence/absence at these sites was used to determine their ecological niche. The evolutionary framework for all 19 species of Hydropsyche encountered was generated by phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and three nuclear genes: wingless, elongation factor 1-alpha and 28S RNA. The phylogenetic tree was used: (1) to assess evolutionary niche conservatism by ecological trait correlation with the tree; and (2) to analyse the phylogenetic relatedness of community member species, at three spatial scales (local stream reaches, drainage basins, biogeographical regions). Results Ecological measurements grouped most species into either headwater, mid-stream or lowland specialists, and traits presumably relevant to river zonation were found to be phylogenetically conservative. Species assemblages at local stream reaches were mostly mono- or dispecific. Species diversity increased at larger spatial scales, by adding species with non-overlapping ecological niches at the level of river basins and by turnover of anciently differentiated lineages at the level of biogeographical regions. This indicates the effects of competition and niche filtering on community structure locally, and ancient ecological diversification and allopatric speciation, respectively, in building up the species pool at basin and biogeographical scales. Main conclusions The study demonstrates the importance of scale (grain size) in studying what determines community composition. Current ecological factors (i.e. competitive exclusion) in Hydropsyche were evident only when studying narrow local sites, while studies of assemblages at larger spatial scales instead demonstrated the roles of ecological niche differentiation, phylogenetic history of trait diversification and allopatric speciation.

Two key issues for community phylogenetics studies, however, are (i) low terminal phylogenetic resolution and (ii) arbitrarily defined species pools. Methodology/principal findings: We used three DNA barcodes (plastid DNA regions rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) to infer a phylogeny for 527 native and naturalized trees of Puerto Rico, representing the vast majority of the entire tree flora of the island (89%). We used a maximum likelihood (ML) approach with and without a constraint tree that enforced monophyly of recognized plant orders. Based on 50% consensus trees, the ML analyses improved phylogenetic resolution relative to a comparable phylogeny generated with PHYLOMATIC (proportion of internal nodes resolved: constrained ML = 74%, unconstrained ML = 68%, PHYLOMATIC = 52%). We quantified the phylogenetic composition of 15 protected forests in Puerto Rico using the constrained ML and PHYLOMATIC phylogenies. We found some evidence that tree communities in areas of high water stress were relatively phylogenetically clustered. Reducing the scale at which the species pool was defined (from island to soil types) changed some of our results depending on which phylogeny (ML vs. PHYLOMATIC) was used. Overall, the increased terminal resolution provided by the ML phylogeny revealed additional patterns that were not observed with a less-resolved phylogeny. Conclusions/significance: With the DNA barcode phylogeny presented here (based on an island-wide species pool), we show that a more fully resolved phylogeny increases power to detect nonrandom patterns of community composition in several Puerto Rican tree communities. Especially if combined with additional information on species functional traits and geographic distributions, this phylogeny will (i) facilitate stronger inferences about the role of historical processes in governing the assembly and composition of Puerto Rican forests, (ii) provide insight into Caribbean biogeography, and (iii) aid in incorporating evolutionary history into conservation planning.",10.1371/journal.pone.0112843,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We present a novel conceptual framework to quantify the contribution of demographic processes (i.e., growth, recruitment, and mortality) to temporal changes in CWMs. We used this framework to analyze mechanisms of secondary succession in wet tropical forests in Mexico. Seed size increased over time, reflecting a trade-off between colonization by small seeds early in succession, to establishment by large seeds later in succession. Specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf phosphorus content decreased over time, reflecting a trade-off between fast growth early in succession vs. high survival late in succession. On average, CWM shifts were driven mainly (70%) by growth of surviving trees that comprise the bulk of standing biomass, then mortality (25%), and weakly by recruitment (5%). Trait shifts of growing and recruiting trees mirrored the CWM trait shifts, and traits of dying trees did not change during succession, indicating that these traits are important for recruitment and growth, but not for mortality, during the first 30yr of succession.

Maximum likelihood logistic regression showed that aspect, age, and substrate type could be used to predict vegetative structural stage. In addition it showed that the structural complexity of the vegetation was greater in landslides (1) facing the southeast (away from the dominant wind direction of recent hurricanes), (2) that were older, and (3) that had volcaniclastic rather than dioritic substrate. Multiple regression indicated that both elevation and age could be used to predict the current vegetation, and that vegetation complexity was greater both at lower elevation and in older landslides. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients showed that (1) the presence of volcaniclastic substrate in landslides was negatively correlated with aspect, age, and elevation, (2) that road association and age were positively correlated, and (3) that slope was negatively correlated with area. Finally, principal components analysis showed that landslides were differentiated on axes defined primarily by age, aspect class, and elevation in the positive direction, and by volcaniclastic substrate in the negative direction. Because several statistical techniques indicated that age, aspect, elevation, and substrate were important in determining vegetation complexity on landslides, we conclude that landslide succession is influenced by variation in these landscape traits. In particular, we would expect to find more successional; development on landslides which are older, face away from hurricane winds, are at lower elevation, and are on volcaniclastic substrate. Finally, our results lead into a hierarchical conceptual model of succession on landscapes where the biota respond first to either gradients or disturbance depending on their relative severity, and then to more local biotic mechanisms such as dispersal, predation and competition.",10.1023/A:1007942804047,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here we demonstrate this approach for a group of 14 consumer fish species (Labeobarbus spp., Cyprinidae) and 11 aquatic resource categories coexisting in Lake Tana in northern Ethiopia, analysing large sets of phenotypic consumer and resource traits with known roles in feeding ecology. We systematically reconstruct structure and geometry of trophic niche space, in which link strengths are predicted by the distances between consumers and resources. These distances are then represented graphically resulting in an image of trophic niche space and its occupancy. We find trophic niche to be multidimensional. Among the models we analysed, one with two resource and two consumer traits had the highest predictive power for link strength. Results further suggest that trophic niche space has a pseudo-Euclidean geometry, meaning that link strength decays with distance in some dimensions of trophic niche space, while it increases with distance in other dimensions.

These changes could be key drivers of habitat stability and ecosystem services in urban greenspaces. The aim of this study was to test the influence of urbanization on taxonomic and functional diversities of arthropods of different trophic levels. We collected predator spiders, polyphagous rove beetles, and decomposer woodlice along a rural-suburban-urban gradient by litter sifting. Neither the taxonomic, nor the functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) using a morphological trait (body size) and ecological traits (habitat affinity, humidity preference, and disturbance sensitivity) of the spiders were significantly different along the urbanization gradient. For rove beetles, taxonomic diversity was significantly higher in rural sites compared to suburban and urban ones, while functional diversity did not differ significantly between sites. Both the taxonomic and the functional diversities of woodlice were significantly higher in the rural sites than in the suburban or urban sites. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis also showed that urbanization did not cause considerably changes in composition of spider assemblages, while rove beetle and woodlouse assemblages showed clear separation between rural and urban sites. This study pointed out that trophic levels may be a crucial driver of the responses to urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has a less harmful effect on predator spiders, as they can easily recolonize the managed urban greenspaces.

We examined the relative influence of topography, environment, spatial distance, and intra- and interspecific interactions on spatial distribution and performance of Boechera stricta (rockcress), a close perennial relative of model plant Arabidopsis. First, using Bayesian kriging, we mapped the topography and environmental gradients and explored the spatial distribution of naturally occurring rockcress plants and two neighbors, Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) and Solidago missouriensis (goldenrod) found in close proximity within a typical diverse meadow community across topographic and environmental gradients. We then evaluated direct and indirect relationships among variables using Mantel path analysis and developed a network displaying abiotic and biotic interactions in this community. We found significant spatial autocorrelation among rockcress individuals, either because of common microhabitats as displayed by high density of individuals at lower elevation and high soil moisture area, or limited dispersal as shown by significant spatial autocorrelation of naturally occurring inbred lines, or a combination of both. Goldenrod and dandelion density around rockcress does not show any direct relationship with rockcress fecundity, possibly due to spatial segregation of resources. However, dandelion density around rockcress shows an indirect negative influence on rockcress fecundity via herbivory, indicating interspecific competition. Overall, we suggest that common microhabitat preference and limited dispersal are the main drivers for spatial distribution. However, intra-specific interactions and insect herbivory are the main drivers of rockcress performance in the meadow community.",10.3389/fpls.2014.00348,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Nakajima, T",1998,Ecological mechanisms of evolution by natural selection: Causal processes generating density-and-frequency dependent fitness,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"The current theory of natural selection explains that adaptive evolution occurs because genotypes with greater survival or reproductive tendencies, due to their particular biological properties, tend to increase in frequency over the lesser ones in a common environment; therefore, the former will eventually replace the latter. In nature, such a selection process most often occurs in a local population which is nested in a community involving local ecological dynamics which are not clearly articulated in the explanatory scheme of the theory. This paper seeks to explicate such an ecological process giving rise to the evolution of a local population with a particular focus on dynamic effects of an increase in the number of invasive, new types on the fate of old ones. Arguments using the ecological-mechanistic model, representing negative interactions among alternative types of organisms, suggest major ecological mechanisms by which the new replace the old; a selective increase in the number of one type leads to a decrease in the equilibrial abundance of a limiting resource, an increase in the density of conspecifics, and/or an increase in the density of predators, which would in turn lower the per capita reproductive rate, or raise the mortality rate of another and make it extinct. Thus, replacement due to selection is associated with such dynamic shifts in equilibria occurring in a local community. The analysis of three (a resource, a prey and a predator) and four species (those plus a top predator) models suggests that evolutionary processes cannot be predicted without reference to the web structure of the community, that some fitness components causing a selective increase in a particular type can have, in some cases, nothing to do with factors causing selective decreases in alternatives, and that evolution of some traits can occur without resource competition.

In this paper, we investigated a differentiation process of algal species in which an endosymbiotic type was differentiated phenotypically from a free-living ancestral clone, by using an experimental model called the CET microcosm, which contains a green alga (Micractinium sp.), a bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a ciliate (Tetrahymena thermophila) cultured together without an external resource supply for over 5 years. We then analyzed the algal diversification process by comparing algal phenotypic properties regarding cell-aggregate formation and their effects on the survival of Tetrahymena (using a clone isolated on day 2668) in the absence of bacteria. We examined 13 Micractinium clones, including both ancestral and derived clones isolated from long-term (day 1819-1847) CET microcosm cultures. The results revealed that the free-living ancestral algal strain diversified in sympatry into an aggregap-forming type that associates with E. coli, and a non-aggregate-forming type that associates with Tetrahymena. Furthermore, a competition experiment revealed that the endosymbiotic (non-aggregate-forming) type was less adapted to the extracellular environment than the aggregate-forming type. This result suggests that severe competition with a nonendosymbiotic sister line in the extra-host environment favors the host-benefiting phenotype in an endosymbiotic line, because such symbionts can enhance the longevity of the host, thereby enabling the survival and reproduction of the symbiont within the host.

The bacterial population was cultured together with the protozoan population over a long period of time. These were contrasted with single-species control cultures of E. coli (i.e., without predator) experiencing high density-independent mortality from continual dilution of the population, and also a population with strong density-dependent regulation arising from intraspecific competition. The long-term cultures of predator and prey revealed the following changes: predator density increased for some time after inoculation; correspondingly, the specific growth rate of prey increased, and mutants with the long-cell form (which experience low predation rate) appeared and increased in frequency in the population. Comparison of these results with results from control cultures, suggests that predator-mediated competition existed between mutants and the original types in the predator-prey system, i.e., increases in densities of mutants with higher growth rate and/or lower predation rate in the prey population enhanced the predator equilibrium density, which in turn exerted higher predation pressure on the original prey which then decreased in abundance.",10.2307/3546168,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Despite their ecological importance and high market values, the open-ocean lifestyle of tuna, in which effective sensing systems such as color vision are required for capture of prey, has been poorly understood. To elucidate the genetic and evolutionary basis of optic adaptation of tuna, we determined the genome sequence of the Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), using next-generation sequencing technology. A total of 26,433 protein-coding genes were predicted from 16,802 assembled scaffolds. From these, we identified five common fish visual pigment genes: red-sensitive (middle/long-wavelength sensitive; M/LWS), UV-sensitive (short-wavelength sensitive 1; SWS1), blue-sensitive (SWS2), rhodopsin (RH1), and green-sensitive (RH2) opsin genes. Sequence comparison revealed that tuna's RH1 gene has an amino acid substitution that causes a short-wave shift in the absorption spectrum (i.e., blue shift). Pacific bluefin tuna has at least five RH2 paralogs, the most among studied fishes; four of the proteins encoded may be tuned to blue light at the amino acid level. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis suggested that gene conversions have occurred in each of the SWS2 and RH2 loci in a short period. Thus, Pacific bluefin tuna has undergone evolutionary changes in three genes (RH1, RH2, and SWS2), which may have contributed to detecting blue-green contrast and measuring the distance to prey in the blue-pelagic ocean.

If these traits display a phylogenetic signal, phylogenetic distance (PD) can be used as a proxy for trait variation. We provide the first investigation of the degree of phylogenetic signal in traits related to competition in freshwater green phytoplankton. We measured 17 traits related to competition and tested whether they displayed a phylogenetic signal across a molecular phylogeny of 59 species of green algae. We also assessed the fit of five models of trait evolution to trait variation across the phylogeny. There was no significant phylogenetic signal for 13 out of 17 ecological traits. For 7 traits, a non-phylogenetic model provided the best fit. For another 7 traits, a phylogenetic model was selected, but parameter values indicated that trait variation evolved recently, diminishing the importance of common ancestry. This study suggests that traits related to competition in freshwater green algae are not generally well-predicted by patterns of common ancestry.

LocationEuropean Alps (Austria, Switzerland and Italy). MethodsFive glacier forelands subjected to relevant glacier retreat during the last century were investigated. In each glacier foreland, three successional stages were selected at increasing distance from the glacier, corresponding to a gradient of time since deglaciation between 25 and 160years. In each successional stage, soil-dwelling lichens were surveyed within five 1x1m plots. In addition to a classical ecological framework, based on species richness and composition, we applied a functional approach to better elucidate community assembly mechanisms. ResultsA positive relationship was found between species richness and time since deglaciation indicating that richer lichen communities can be found at increasing terrain ageing. This pattern was associated with compositional shifts, suggesting that different community assemblages can be found along the successional stages. The analysis of -diversity revealed a significant nested pattern of species assemblages along the gradient (i.e. earlier successional stages hosted a subset of the species already established in older successional stages), while the turnover component was less relevant. Considering functional groups, we found contrasting patterns in relation to time since deglaciation: the incidence of species with a cyanobacterial photobiont and those reproducing by spores decreased, while that of species reproducing by vegetative propagules increased. Main conclusionsThis study reveals that community assembly patterns of soil-dwelling lichens in alpine glacier forelands are ruled by mechanisms of directional species accumulation and trait selection that involve a trade-off between different functional strategies.

While the effects of phylogenetic relatedness have been previously studied within a single genus or family, lineage-specific effects on the ecological processes governing community assembly have rarely been studied for entire communities or flora. Here, we measured how community phylogenetic structure varies across a wide elevation gradient for plant lineages represented by 35 families, using a co-occurrence index and net relatedness index (NRI). We propose a framework that analyses each lineage separately and reveals the trend of ecological assembly at tree nodes. We found prevailing phylogenetic clustering for more ancient nodes and overdispersion in more recent tree nodes. Closely related species may thus rapidly evolve new environmental tolerances to radiate into distinct communities, while older lineages likely retain inherent environmental tolerances to occupy communities in similar environments, either through efficient dispersal mechanisms or the exclusion of older lineages with more divergent environmental tolerances. Our study illustrates the importance of disentangling the patterns of community assembly among lineages to better interpret the ecological role of traits. It also sheds light on studies reporting absence of phylogenetic signal, and opens new perspectives on the analysis of niche and trait conservatism across lineages.",10.1002/ece3.868,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,,

First, climate and land-use factors play an important role in mountain plant community turnover. Second, the overlap between plant functional and phylogenetic turnover along these gradients correlates with the low phylogenetic signal in traits, suggesting that in mountain landscapes, trait lability is likely an important factor in driving plant community assembly.

In this study, we assessed whether, and by which mechanisms, abiotic changes associated with elevation altered the outcome of an ant-aphid protection mutualism. To do so, we characterized the multi-trophic interactions among the ant Formica podzolica, the aphid Aphis varians, and aphid natural enemies occurring on the plant Chamerion angustifolium within replicate high and low elevation valleys. Low (versus high) elevation sites had longer summers (snowmelt 13 days earlier) and were on average 1.1 degrees C warmer and 41% drier throughout the year. At low elevations, individual ant colonies consumed approximately double the volume of carbohydrate baits, likely due to a higher foraging tempo, and possibly due to a greater demand for sugar- versus protein-rich resources (as indicated by stable isotope analysis). Wild aphid colonies at low elevations were visited by 1.4-fold more natural enemies (controlling for variation in aphid abundance), while experimental aphid colonies on potted plants were tended 52% more frequently by ants. As a result, ants increased aphid colony survival by 66% at low elevations but had no detectable effect at high elevations; at low (versus high) elevations aphid colonies without ants had lower survival, demonstrating stronger predator effects, while aphid colonies with ants had higher survival, demonstrating even stronger ant benefits. Analyses for the effects of mean summer temperature yielded qualitatively identical results to those based on elevation.

Changes in the olfactory systems of insects that rely on different host plants, for example, can occur in response to differences in sensory stimuli between habitats. In this study, we investigate the evolution of host preference by characterizing the coeloconic sensilla in Drosophila mojavensis, a species that breeds on different necrotic cacti across its geographic range. These cactus species differ in the volatile chemicals they emit, a primary sensory cue for host plant discrimination. Analysis of odor-evoked responses identified four coeloconic sensilla that were qualitatively similar to those of Drosophila melanogaster, but varied in the breadth and strength of their olfactory sensory neuron responses to some acids and amines. Variation in responses to certain odorants among D. mojavensis populations was also observed. Compared to D. melanogaster, there was a lack of sensitivity of antennal coeloconic type 3 (ac3) sensilla to primary ligands of OR35a across all populations. Consistent with this result was a lack of detectable Or35a gene expression. Using a comparative approach, we then examined odor specificity of ac3 sensilla for seven additional Drosophila species, and found that OR35a-like sensitivity may be limited to the melanogaster subgroup. The variation in specificity that was observed among species is not clearly attributable to the degree of ecological specialization, nor to the ecological niche.",10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.08.003,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Therefore, understanding how species are affected by it is crucial to guide conservation decisions. Species respond differently to land-use change, possibly related to their traits. Using pan-tropical data on bird occurrence and abundance across a human land-use intensity gradient, we tested the effects of seven traits on observed responses. A likelihood-based approach allowed us to quantify uncertainty in modelled responses, essential for applying the model to project future change. Compared with undisturbed habitats, the average probability of occurrence of bird species was 7.8 per cent and 31.4 per cent lower, and abundance declined by 3.7 per cent and 19.2 per cent in habitats with low and high human land-use intensity, respectively. Five of the seven traits tested affected the observed responses significantly: long-lived, large, non-migratory, primarily frugivorous or insectivorous forest specialists were both less likely to occur and less abundant in more intensively used habitats than short-lived, small, migratory, non-frugivorous/insectivorous habitat generalists.

Internal community structure was investigated through fitting the rank-abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units to different models. Heterogeneity of communities within islands was assessed by analysis of group dispersion. The mean OTU richness per sample was significantly lower on the artificial island than on the neighboring natural island, indicating that richness of the colonizing AM fungal community is restricted by limited dispersal. The AM fungal communities colonizing the new island appeared to be a non-random subset of communities on the natural and much older neighboring island, which points to high colonization potential of certain probably early successional mycorrhizal fungi, likely assisted by migratory birds.

Our understanding of microbial filter feeding is poor, and, importantly, it is unknown what force microbial filter feeders must generate to process adequate amounts of water. Also, the trade-off in the filter spacing remains unexplored, despite its simple formulation: A filter too coarse will allow suitably sized prey to pass unintercepted, whereas a filter too fine will cause strong flow resistance. We quantify the feeding flow of the filter-feeding choanoflagellate Diaphanoeca grandis using particle tracking, and demonstrate that the current understanding of microbial filter feeding is inconsistent with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and analytical estimates. Both approaches underestimate observed filtration rates by more than an order of magnitude; the beating flagellum is simply unable to draw enough water through the fine filter. We find similar discrepancies for other choanoflagellate species, highlighting an apparent paradox. Our observations motivate us to suggest a radically different filtration mechanism that requires a flagellar vane (sheet), something notoriously difficult to visualize but sporadically observed in the related choanocytes (sponges). A CFD model with a flagellar vane correctly predicts the filtration rate of D. grandis, and using a simple model we can account for the filtration rates of other microbial filter feeders. We finally predict how optimum filter mesh size increases with cell size in microbial filter feeders, a prediction that accords very well with observations.

Community-level models (CLMs) consider multiple, co-occurring species in model fitting and are lesser known alternatives to species distribution models (SDMs) for analysing and predicting biodiversity patterns. Community-level models simultaneously model multiple species, including rare species, while reducing overfitting and implicitly considering drivers of co-occurrence. Many CLMs are direct extensions of well-known SDMs and therefore should be familiar to ecologists. However, CLMs remain underutilized, and there have been few tests of their potential benefits and no systematic reviews of their assumptions and implementations. Here, we review this emerging field and provide examples in r to fit common CLMs. Our goal is to introduce CLMs to a broader audience, and discuss their attributes, benefits and limitations relative to SDMs. 2. We review (1) statistical implementations and applications of CLMs, (2) their advantages and limitations, and (3) comparative analyses of CLMs and SDMs. We also suggest directions for future research. 3. We identify seven CLM algorithms with similar data structures and predictive outputs as SDMs that should be most accessible to ecologists familiar with species-level modelling, including five methods that predict assemblage composition and individual species distributions and two methods that model compositional turnover along environmental gradients. Community-level models have been applied to numerous taxa, regions, and spatial scales, and a variety of topics (e.g. studying drivers of community structure or assessing relationships between community composition and functional traits). Studies suggest that the relative benefits of CLMs and SDMs may be case specific, especially in terms of predicting species distributions and community composition. However, CLMs may offer advantages in terms of computational efficiency, modelling rare species, and projecting to no-analog climates. A major shortcoming of CLMs is their reliance on presence-absence community composition data. 4. Studies are needed to assess the relative merits of SDMs and CLMs, and different CLM algorithms, with a focus on three key areas: (1) under which circumstances CLMs improve predictions for rare species, (2) how CLMs perform under different community compositions (e.g. relative abundance of rare vs. common species), including the extent to which co-occurrence patterns are structured by biotic interactions, and (3) ability to project across time/space.",10.1111/2041-210X.12936,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats arc defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi-Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity' associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis.

How would community assembly processes be affected by a substantial change in soil characteristics when all other relevant factors are held constant? In particular, can we identify some functional adaptations which would underpin such soil-induced vegetation response? Location: Eastern Serbia: fields partially damaged by long-term and large-scale fluvial deposition of sulphidic waste from a Cu mine; subcontinental/submediterranean climate. Methods: We analysed the multivariate response of cereal weed assemblages (including biomass and foliar analyses) to a strong man-made soil gradient (from highly calcareous to highly acidic, nutrient-poor soils) over short distances (field scale). Results: The soil gradient favoured a substitution of calcicoles by calcifuges, and an increase in abundance of pseudometallophytes, with preferences for Atlantic climate, broad geographical distribution, hemicryptophytic life form, adapted to low-nutrient and acidic soils, with lower concentrations of Ca, and very narrow range of Cu concentrations in leaves. The trends of abundance of the different ecological groups of indicator species along the soil gradient were systematically reflected in the maintenance of leaf P concentrations, and strong homeostasis in biomass N:P ratio. Conclusion: Using annual weed vegetation at the field scale as a fairly simple model, we demonstrated links between gradients in soil properties (pH, nutrient availability) and floristic composition that are normally encountered over large geographic distances. We showed that leaf nutrient status, in particular the maintenance of leaf P concentrations and strong homeostasis of biomass N:P ratio, underpinned a clear functional response of vegetation to mineral stress.

Such data are common in ecological studies when modelling multivariate abundances or biomass. By extending the standard generalized linear modelling framework to include latent variables, we can account for any covariation between species not accounted for by the predictors, notably species interactions and correlations driven by missing covariates. We show how estimation and inference for the considered models can be performed efficiently using the Laplace approximation method and use simulations to study the finite-sample properties of the resulting estimates. In the overdispersed count data case, the Laplace-approximated estimates perform similarly to the estimates based on variational approximation method, which is another method that provides a closed form approximation of the likelihood. In the biomass data case, we show that ignoring the correlation between taxa affects the regression estimates unfavourably.

While knowledge has accumulated concerning the effects of population density and climatic conditions, a topical question now concerns how predation and harvest influence demographic parameters and population growth (lambda). We performed a comparative demographic analysis based on projection matrix models for female roe deer. Population-specific matrices were parameterized based on longitudinal data from five intensively monitored populations in Norway and France, spanning a large variability in environmental characteristics such as densities of large predators, hunter harvest and seasonality. As expected for a large iteroparous vertebrate, temporal variation was invariably higher in recruitment than in adult survival, and the elasticity of adult survival was consistently higher than that of recruitment. However, the relative difference in elasticity of lambda to recruitment and adult survival varied strongly across populations, and was closely correlated with adult survival. Different traits accounted for most of the variance in lambda in different ecological settings. Adult survival generally contributed more in populations with low mean adult survival and low mean growth rate during the study period. Hunters and predators (Eurasian lynx and red foxes) occurred in two of our study populations and contributed substantially to the variance in lambda, accounting for a total of 35% and 70% in the two populations respectively. Across populations, we did not find any evidence that roe deer increased their reproductive output when faced with harsh conditions, resulting in some populations having negative growth rates. Generation time, a measure of the speed of the life-history cycle, increased from less than 4 years in the most productive population ('roe deer heaven') to more than 6 years in declining populations facing predation from lynx, red fox and hunters ('roe deer hell'), and was tightly and inversely correlated with lambda. Such a deceleration of the life cycle in declining populations might be a general feature in large herbivores. Our results shows that the plethora of environmental conditions faced by populations of large herbivores also induce high intraspecific variation in their ranking along the 'fast-slow' continuum of life-history tactics.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01523.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,"traits were of the population, ",

Experiments have shown that the efficacy of conspicuous colouration increases with increasing size of pattern elements and larger body size. Prey species that have acquired avoidance inducing colouration therefore may be exposed to selection for larger body size, and such colouration may more easily evolve in large than in small prey species. Here we test for a difference in body size between species with different colouration modes and perform a comparative analysis based on phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine if evolutionary shifts in colour pattern have been associated with evolutionary changes in body size, using data for 578 species of moths. Larval body size did not differ between species with signalling and non-signalling larvae, and results from the comparative analysis suggest that these two traits have not evolved in parallel. The lack of association between evolutionary changes in colouration and body size may reflect a confounding influence of lifestyle, because evolutionary shifts from solitary to group-living larvae were associated with decreased larval body length and adult wing span. Because evolutionary changes in larval body size were associated with evolutionary changes in adult wing span the predicted association between colouration and size may have been confounded also by conflicting selection on body size in larvae and adults.",10.1023/A:1022417601010,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = larval colouration, body size, lifestyle (solitary or gregarious)",

The study of community phylogenetic structure, which applies phylogeny to community ecology studies, has provided an effective way to disentangle the most important ecological processes that drive community assembly. Studying the phylogenetic structure of a community involves firstly the construction of a supertree representing the species pool of the community, then a calculation of phylogenetic distances between all species within the community, and finally an inference of phylogenetic structure (e.g., clustering, overdispersion) obtained by statistically testing whether the obtained phylogenetic distances are different from those expected under random model, hence revealing key ecological processes involved in community assembly (e.g., habitat filtering, competition exclusion). Community phylogenetic structure is different when studied at different taxonomic, spatial or temporal scales. At small spatial scales, community phylogenetic pattern tends to change from clustering to overdispersion with decreasing taxonomical scale or increasing tree age class, while the pattern tends to be tighter clustering at larger spatial scales. Phylogenetic information also indicates the influence of environmental factors and studying community phylogeny at the metacommunity level helps to understand regional ecological processes. In addition, phylogenetic structure can help to explore neutral theory, density-dependent hypothesis and other theories in ecology, and even to predict community dynamics and evolution under disturbance. The future application of phylogenetic structure to disclosing underlying causes of community assembly demands the joint analysis of ecological traits and environment factors and, the consideration of both local processes (e.g., microenvironment, biological interactions) and regional processes (e.g., geological history, speciation). In terms of methodological aspects, to construct a phylogenetic tree, appropriate gene segments should be used and the tree needs to be corrected using ecological traits in order to reflect more exact phylogenetic distances among species. Furthermore, more effective statistical models and indices are needed to increase statistical power.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

To test predictions concerning the role of insularity and low predation risk as factors selecting for the use of torpor, and the evolution of low basal metabolic rate in island species, we examined thermoregulation under laboratory and semi-natural conditions in a mainland species, the African Green Pigeon (Treron calvus). Under laboratory conditions, rest-phase body temperature (T (b)) was significantly and positively correlated with air temperature (T (a)) between 0 and 35 A degrees C, and the relationship between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and T (a) differed from typical endothermic patterns. The minimum RMR, which we interpret as basal metabolic rate (BMR), was 0.825 +/- A 0.090 W. Green pigeons responded to food restriction by significantly decreasing rest-phase T (b), but the reductions were small (at most similar to 5 A degrees C below normothermic values), with a minimum T (b) of 33.1 A degrees C recorded in a food-deprived bird. We found no evidence of the large reductions in T (b) and metabolic rate and the lethargic state characteristic of torpor.

Cab57 was isolated from the rhizosphere of shepherds purse growing in a field in Hokkaido by screening the antibiotic producers. The whole genome sequence of this strain was obtained by paired-end and whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the gaps between the contigs were closed using gap-spanning PCR products. The P. sp. Cab57 genome is organized into a single circular chromosome with 6,827,892 bp, 63.3% G+C content, and 6,186 predicted protein-coding sequences. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis and whole genome analysis, strain Cab57 was identified as P. protegens. As reported in P. protegens CHA0 and Pf-5, four gene clusters (phl, prn, plt, and hcn) encoding the typical antibiotic metabolites and the reported genes associated with Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway of these strains are fully conserved in the Cab57 genome. Actually strain Cab57 exhibited typical Gac/Rsm activities and antibiotic production, and these activities were enhanced by knocking out the retS gene (for a sensor kinase acting as an antagonist of GacS). Two large segments (79 and 115 kb) lacking in the Cab57 genome, as compared with the Pf-5 genome, accounted for the majority of the difference (247 kb) between these genomes. One of these segments was the complete rhizoxin analog biosynthesis gene cluster (ca. 79 kb) and another one was the 115-kb mobile genomic island. A whole genome comparison of those relative strains revealed that each strain has unique gene clusters involved in metabolism such as nitrite/nitrate assimilation, which was identified in the Cab57 genome. These findings suggest that P. protegens is a ubiquitous bacterium that controls its biocontrol traits while building up strain-specific genomic repertoires for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and niche adaptation.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

A prompt germination strategy would therefore enable large seeds to reduce risks of mortality.To assess this predicted relationship between seed mass and mean time to germination (MTG), we used a meta-analysis of published data sources. Our data base contained information for these two traits for 1037 tree species from five tropical areas worldwide (Brazil, India, Ivory Coast, Malaysia and Panama). Both cross-species analyses and phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC) were conducted on the log-transformed values of seed mass and MTG.Log-seed mass was a significantly phylogenetically conserved trait in all five data sets. Log-MTG was significantly phylogenetically conserved in all sites except for Malaysia and India.Log-MTG and log-seed mass were significantly positively correlated in all sites except for Malaysia. PIC analyses showed a significantly positive relationship in Brazil, India and Ivory Coast but not in Malaysia and Panama. When all sites were combined, PIC analyses indicated a significant positive relationship between these two traits.Our findings do not support the hypothesis that large seeds germinate faster than small seeds, but rather that small seeds germinate faster.

In this study, we use mathematical models to explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that modulate the explanatory power of phylogenetic information for communities of species that interact within a single trophic level. We find that phylogenetic relationships among species can influence trait evolution and rates of interaction among species, but only under particular models of species interaction. For example, when interactions within communities are mediated by a mechanism of phenotype matching, phylogenetic trees make specific predictions about trait evolution and rates of interaction. In contrast, if interactions within a community depend on a mechanism of phenotype differences, phylogenetic information has little, if any, predictive power for trait evolution and interaction rate.

In some interactions, such as those between cuckoos and their hosts, interactions are mediated by the degree of phenotype matching among species, and a significant body of theory has been developed to predict the coevolutionary dynamics and outcomes of such interactions. In a large number of other cases, however, interactions are mediated by the extent to which the phenotype of one species exceeds that of the other. For these cases-which are arguably more numerous-few theoretical predictions exist for coevolutionary dynamics and outcomes. Here we develop and analyze mathematical models of interspecific interactions mediated by the extent to which the quantitative trait of one species exceeds that of the other. Our results identify important differences from previously studied models based on trait matching. First, our results show that cyclical dynamics are possible only if the strength of coevolutionary selection exceeds a threshold and stabilizing selection acts on the interacting traits. Second, our results demonstrate that significant levels of genetic polymorphism can be maintained only when cyclical dynamics occur. This result leads to the unexpected prediction that maintenance of genetic polymorphism is enhanced by strong selection. Finally, our results demonstrate that there is no a priori reason to expect the traits of interacting species should match in any literal sense, even in the absence of gene flow among populations.",10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00158.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Previous efforts to understand and predict the coevolutionary dynamics of these interactions have generally assumed that standing genetic variation is fixed or absent altogether. We develop a genetically explicit model of coevolution that bridges the gap between these approaches by allowing genetic variation itself to evolve. Analysis of this model shows that the evolution of genetic variance has important consequences for the dynamics and outcome of coevolution. Of particular importance is our demonstration that coevolutionary cycles can emerge in the absence of stabilizing selection, an outcome not possible in previous models of coevolution mediated by quantitative traits. Whether coevolutionary cycles evolve depends upon the strength of selection, the number of loci, and the rate of mutation in each of the interacting species.

Yet, to what extent the projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely unknown. To analyse this issue, we built an on-line survey addressed to restoration practitioners. We analysed 36 restoration projects, mostly from drylands (86%). The projects used mainly soil from local sources. The need to comply with legislation was more important as a restoration motive for European Union (EU) than for non-EU countries, while public opinion and health had a greater importance in the latter. Non-EU countries relied more on non-native plant species than EU countries, thus deviating from ecological restoration guidelines. Nursery-grown plants used were mostly of local or regional provenance, whilst seeds were mostly of national provenance. Unexpected restoration results (e.g. inadequate biodiversity) were reported for 50% of the projects and restoration success was never evaluated in 22%. Long term evaluation (>6 years) was only performed in 31% of cases, and based primarily on plant diversity and cover. The use of non-native species and species of exogenous provenances may: i) entail the loss of local genetic and functional trait diversity, critical to cope with drought, particularly under the predicted climate change scenarios, and ii) lead to unexpected competition with native species and/or negatively impact local biotic interactions. Absent or inappropriate monitoring may prevent the understanding of restoration trajectories, precluding adaptive management strategies, often crucial to create functional ecosystems able to provide ecosystem services. The overview of ecological restoration projects in the Mediterranean Basin revealed high variability among practices and highlighted the need for improved scientific assistance and information exchange, greater use of native species of local provenance, and more long-term monitoring and evaluation, including functional and ecosystem services' indicators, to improve and spread the practice of ecological restoration.

Spectroscopy is increasingly used for rapid and non-destructive estimation of foliar traits, but few studies have evaluated its accuracy when assessing phenotypic variation in multiple traits. Working with 24 chemical and physical leaf traits of six European tree species growing on strongly contrasting soil types (i.e. deep alluvium versus nearby shallow chalk), we asked (i) whether variability in leaf traits is greater between tree species or soil type, and (ii) whether field spectroscopy is effective at predicting intraspecific variation in leaf traits as well as interspecific differences. Analysis of variance showed that interspecific differences in traits were generally much stronger than intraspecific differences related to soil type, accounting for 25% versus 5% of total trait variation, respectively. Structural traits, phenolic defences and pigments were barely affected by soil type. In contrast, foliar concentrations of rock-derived nutrients did vary: P and K concentrations were lower on chalk than alluvial soils, while Ca, Mg, B, Mn and Zn concentrations were all higher, consistent with the findings of previous ecological studies. Foliar traits were predicted from 400 to 2500 nm reflectance spectra collected by field spectroscopy using partial least square regression, a method that is commonly employed in chemometrics. Pigments were best modelled using reflectance data from the visible region (400700 nm), while all other traits were best modelled using reflectance data from the shortwave infrared region (11002500 nm). Spectroscopy delivered accurate predictions of species-level variation in traits. However, it was ineffective at detecting intraspecific variation in rock-derived nutrients (with the notable exception of P). The explanation for this failure is that rock-derived elements do not have absorption features in the 400-2500 nm region, and their estimation is indirect, relying on elemental concentrations covarying with structural traits that do have absorption features in that spectral region (""constellation effects""). Since the structural traits did not vary with soil type, it was impossible for our regression models to predict intraspecific variation in rock-derived nutrients via constellation effects. This study demonstrates the value of spectroscopy for rapid, non-destructive estimation of foliar traits across species, but highlights problems with predicting intraspecific variation indirectly. We discuss the implications of these findings for mapping functional traits by airborne imaging spectroscopy.",10.5194/bg-14-3371-2017,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,1,1,1,0,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,1,1,1,"traits = N%, N15%, C13%, chlorphyll a, chlorophyll b, anthocyanins, carotenoids, efficiency of PSII, soluble C, leaf content %, LMA, phenolics  %, hemicellulose %, Cellulose %, Lignin%, Si%, P%, K%, Ca%, Mg%, B weight, Fe weight, Mn weight, Zn weight.

The dominance of larval helminths in the component community suggests that T. atun occupies an intermediate position in the food web. The 'nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill' (NODF) indicated that the parasite assemblage exhibited no nestedness (NODF = 73.3, p = 0.103). Generalised additive mixed modelling results indicated that host length is the main determinant of parasite species richness in T. atun. PERMANOVA and ANOSIM suggested that infracommunity structure varied little with respect to the sex, length, seasonality and capture region of the host. The stability and randomness in parasite acquisition, as indicated by the lack of nestedness of the parasite assemblage, can be ascribed to the opportunistic feeding behaviour and nomadic movement of T. atun in the southern Benguela.

"Nycz-Wasilec, Pawel",2002,On the stoichiometric approach in ecological approach.,Wiadomosci Ekologiczne,"The food web and ecosystem concepts are among the most important tools in describing nature from the ecological perspective. Traditionally, energy has been the single currency of the framework. Although the energetics perspective has had wide application and success, critical examination revealed inadequacies in this paradigm, e.g. because of disparities between the elemental composition of many foods and the elemental demands of many consumers, the availability of energy is less important than that of the elements in determining the reproductive success and population dynamics of animals. The stoichiometric approach analyses the constraints and consequences of mass balance of multiple chemical elements (mainly carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) in ecological interactions. The approach is proposed to supplement and extend insights from ecological energetics. Such analyses have a rich history in pelagic ecology owing the work of A. C. Redfield and co-workers. However, the consequent and detailed stoichiometric analyses of the whole food webs were conducted not until the late 80s. In that experiment, the stoichiometric approach helped in understanding the role of consumers and food web structure in nutrient cycling. Numerous detailed hypotheses constitute the modern stoichiometric approach. Stoichiometric theory states, that the imbalance between food composition and consumer body composition may result in the growth rate reduction of the consumer. The reciprocal interactions between producers and consumers caused by consumer-driven nutrient recycling may lead to different dynamics of the whole system. Assumptions and predictions of the hypotheses are intensively tested at the ecosystem level of pelagic systems. The concept of the stoichiometry from genes to ecosystems extended the stoichiometric analyses to genetic mechanisms, underlaying the organismal stoichiometry. The stoichiometry may have pronounced effects on both food web structure and ecosystem functioning. On the other hand, phosphorus content in bodies seems to be a marker of the specific growth rate, that is one of the most important trait of the life history. This way, evolutionary processes may hypothetically affect ecosystem functioning. One of the biggest challenges in the stoichiometric approach is to extend it consequently to terrestrial systems, especially soil systems. The C:N ratio in soil sciences and agriculture has a very long tradition. However, consequent stoichiometric approach to the whole edaphic systems, including phosphorus in the analyses, remain an unexplored area. The modern, complex stoichiometric approach in ecology has not been criticized so far, thus its constraints are not well defined. Nevertheless, it seems to be promising perspective in integrating different sub-disciplines (e.g. community and ecosystem ecology), as well as different ecosystem/evolutionary processes across different organization levels of the biosphere.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Trait patterns were determined by comparing Q (observed) to Q from random communities. While trait patterns can be determined by species traits, richness, and abundance, in most samples, irrespective of layer, trait patterns could be solely attributed to traits indicating their importance for community assembly. Trait convergence dominated in the upper layer, while trait divergence dominated in the lower layer. Using logistic regression, we related trait patterns to environmental parameters. In the lower layer, trait divergence was linked to competition for food while trait convergence was linked to copepod predation. However, in the upper layer neither competitors nor predators influenced trait patterns, and we suggest that ultraviolet radiation and temperature were the main drivers of trait convergence.

In multivariate analyses, water residence time and surface water temperature were important environmental predictors for both taxonomic and functional diversity while the importance of competitors and predators varied according to defence or feeding traits used.

How these differences are maintained in response to changes in population density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates. Using a behavioral reaction norm ( BRN) framework, we examined how among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured using social network analyses, change as a function of population density. We studied a captive herd of elk ( Cervus canadensis) separated into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social benefits ( e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity. Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in other ecological processes ( e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice, disease transfer).",10.1371/journal.pone.0193425,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"O'Callaghan, Matt J.; Hannah, David M.; Boomer, Ian; Williams, Mike; Sadler, Jon P.",2013,Responses to River Inundation Pressures Control Prey Selection of Riparian Beetles,PLOS ONE,"Background: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation (flooding) and are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability in aquatic/terrestrial subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of this subsidy in active riparian floodplains is thought to underpin local biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates dominate the fauna, exhibiting traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic subsidies while reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species micro-spatial positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from either aquatic or terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to inundation tolerance and avoidance.Method/Principal Findings: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to inundation risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The study examined patch scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of the aquatic subsidy according to species traits. Prey sourced from terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic invertebrates varied in relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance strategies. Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting uptake. Less able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and switched to a terrestrial diet under moderate inundation pressures. All trait groups showed a seasonal shift in diet towards terrestrial prey in the early spring. Prey selection became exaggerated towards aquatic prey in downstream samples.Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that partitioning of resources and habitat creates overlapping niches that increase the processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By demonstrating functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological variability.

Despite variable collecting density among and within biogeographic regions, the Andean region clearly presents a higher species richness, particularly in the central coffee growing zone and the departments of Antioquia, Cundinamarca and Valle del Cauca. The elevational distribution of diversity shows a small peak below 500 m, and two higher ones between 1,000-2,000 and 2,500-3,000 m. This pattern corresponds to divergent adaptive trends among infrageneric divisions. The analysis on 19 climatic variables showed that the two principal variance components, explaining 77 percent of the total, are respectively associated with temperature and precipitation, without influence of seasonality. Distribution parameters allow recognizing more than 36 narrow endemics. Prediction of species distribution showed nine areas with very high richness (predicted sympatry of 41 to 54 species) in the Andean region, three of which correspond to collection gaps. Endemics were not particularly frequent there, so a prioritization of protected areas based on species richness would not favor their conservation. The sites with high Passiflora diversity are poorly represented in the current system of protected areas. Instead, their striking correspondence with ecotopes of the coffee growing zone imposes a conservation strategy integrating agricultural and environmental management at the landscape level.

On the contrary, recent theoretical developments argue that competitive exclusion may lead to patterns of either over-dispersion, clustering or randomness, depending on the relative importance of niche differences and interspecific competitive ability differences. In this study, we utilized semi-natural grassland communities to test the hypothesis that the pattern of species relatedness generated by competitive exclusion depends on species niche differences. Instead of inferring processes from observed patterns, we experimentally manipulated grassland plots to test the effects of competitive exclusion. We compared grazed plots (in which grazing functioned as an equalizing mechanism and suppressed aboveground competition) with neighbouring plots experimentally excluded from grazing over the course of nine years (in which aboveground competition was not prevented). Weak niche differences between species allowed competitive exclusion to generate phylogenetic clustering, because phylogenetically structured plant canopy height and capacity for lateral spread conferred superior competitive ability to grasses that outcompeted species in all dicot branches. By contrast, moderate niche differences allowed competitive exclusion to result in a random pattern of phylogenetic species assembly, because species niche differences partially counterbalanced competitive exclusion by superior competitors in the grass family.

This is also true for phytoplankton in seasonally ice-covered temperate lakes which are particularly vulnerable to the presence or absence of ice. We examined changes in pelagic phytoplankton winter community structure in a north temperate lake (Muggelsee, Germany), covering 18 winters between 1995 and 2013. We tested how phytoplankton taxa composition varied along a winter-severity gradient and to what extent winter severity shaped the functional trait composition of overwintering phytoplankton communities using multivariate statistical analyses and a functional trait-based approach. We hypothesized that overwintering phytoplankton communities are dominated by taxa with trait combinations corresponding to the prevailing winter water column conditions, using ice thickness measurements as a winter-severity indicator. Winter severity had little effect on univariate diversity indicators (taxon richness and evenness), but a strong relationship was found between the phytoplankton community structure and winter severity when taxon trait identity was taken into account. Species responses to winter severity were mediated by the key functional traits: motility, nutritional mode, and the ability to form resting stages. Accordingly, one or the other of two functional groups dominated the phytoplankton biomass during mild winters (i.e., thin or no ice cover; phototrophic taxa) or severe winters (i.e., thick ice cover; exclusively motile taxa). Based on predicted milder winters for temperate regions and a reduction in ice-cover durations, phytoplankton communities during winter can be expected to comprise taxa that have a relative advantage when the water column is well mixed (i.e., need not be motile) and light is less limiting (i.e., need not be mixotrophic).

The peculiar mandible morphologies of these ants have evolved depending on characteristics of the prey. Specifically, the evolution of mandible size and shape may be directly driven by prey size.2. In the present study, the intraspecific variation of the morphological traits of Strumigenys lewisi populations were observed in central Japan. The relationships between the morphological variations and the prey body size were analysed.3. In workers and queens, three morphological traits, head width, mandible length, and mandible width were significantly different among the multiple sites. Specifically, the mandible length was shorter in southwestern Japan than in other sampling locations. The ancova model revealed that the allometry of the mandible length to the head width was different among the sites.4. As predicted, the mandible length was positively correlated with the average body size of collembolans in the Entomobryidae family. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that the variation of the mandible length was affected by environmental factors represented as location information. However, the effect of collembolan body size was more effective at predicting mandible length. The study suggests that the geographical variation of mandible morphologies in S. lewisi has been selected by predator-prey interactions with collembolans.",10.1111/een.12374,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,0,0,0,1,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = head width to body size ratio, length and width of mandibles",

However, alternative measures based on ecomorphological traits are also critical for unveiling the processes shaping biodiversity and community assembly along environmental gradients. Our study presents the first analysis of habitat-trait-community structure in a Balkan biodiversity hotspot (Louros river, NW Greece), through the investigation of the relationships among freshwater fish assemblages' composition, morphological traits and habitat features. In order to provide a hierarchical classification of species' priority to protection measures, we highlight the most ecomorphologically distinct species using originality analysis. Our results suggest that the longitudinal changes of habitat variables (water temperature, depth, substrate, altitude) drive the local fish assemblages' structure highlighting the upstream-downstream gradient. We also present evidence for environmental filtering, establishing fish assemblages according to their ecomorphological traits. The calculation of the seven available indices of ecomorphological originality indicates that Valencia letourneuxi and Cobitis hellenica, which are endemic to Louros and threatened with extinction, exhibited the highest distinctiveness; thus their protection is of great importance. The methodological approach followed and the patterns described herein can contribute further to the application of community ecology theory to conservation, highlighting the need to use ecomorphological traits as a useful 'tool'.",10.1007/s10641-018-0759-6,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = Oral gape surface, oral gape shape, oral gape position, eye size, eye position, body transverse shape, body transversal surface, pectoral fin position, aspect ratio of pectoral fin, caudal peduncle throttling, aspect ratio of caudal fin, fins surface ratio, fins surface to body size ratio",

Therefore, a K-strategic fungivorus nematode, Tylencholaimus parvus, was examined for population growth rates on nine fungal species on agar and on soil-based media. Also, the nematode was compared with an r-strategic fungivorus nematode, Aphelenchus avenae, in terms of population growth rates on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and of prey-predator relationships with nematophagus fungi, Pleurotus spp., growing on water agar. Population Growth rates of T. parvus on PDA were large on three plant-pathogenic fungi, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum and Phoma herbarum. On the soil-based medium, two saprophytic fungi, Coprinus cinereus and Flammulina velutipes, also supported large population increases of the nematode, as well as F. oxysporum and P. herbarum.

"Okamoto, KW; Amarasekare, P",2018,A framework for high-throughput eco-evolutionary simulations integrating multilocus forward-time population genetics and community ecology,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The evolutionary dynamics of quantitative traits in a species depends on demographic structure (e.g. age- and size-dependent vital rates, migration across subpopulations, mate preferences, and the presence or absence of overlapping generations), which in turn can depend on interspecific interactions with other evolving species. Furthermore, biologists increasingly appreciate that evolutionary change in a single species can substantively affect broader ecological processes, such as community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Models integrating insights from classical population and quantitative genetics, on the one hand, and community ecology theory, on the other, are therefore critical to elucidating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. However, few modelling approaches integrate ecological and genetic details into a comprehensive framework. Such models are needed to account for the reciprocal feedback between evolutionary change and ecological dynamics, and develop effective responses to anthropogenic disturbances on natural communities, improve agricultural practices and manage global health risks such as emerging pathogens. Here we introduce an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator and framework for rapidly simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our approach permits building models that can account for alternative genetic architectures, non-standard population dynamics and demographic structures, including those driven by interspecific interactions with other evolving species and the spatial dynamics of metacommunities. By integrating these processes into a common framework, we aim to facilitate the development of models that can further elucidate eco-evolutionary dynamics. While multi-species, forward-time population genetic models can be computationally expensive, we show how our framework leverages relatively economical graphics cards installed in modern desktops. We illustrate the versatility and general applicability of our approach for two very different case studies: antagonistic coevolution in space, and the evolution of life-history traits in response to resource dynamics in physiologically structured populations. We find that our analyses can run up to c. 200 times faster on a single commodity graphics card than on a single CPU core, comparable to the performance gains on small-to-medium sized computer clusters. Our approach therefore substantively reduces implementation difficulties to integrating ecological and evolutionary theory.",10.1111/2041-210X.12889,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Oke, OA; Heard, SB; Lundholm, JT",2014,Integrating phylogenetic community structure with species distribution models: an example with plants of rock barrens,ECOGRAPHY,"Approaches using phylogenetic pattern in ecological communities to deduce processes of community assembly have been criticised as disconnected from foundations in ecological mechanism, especially with respect to lack of data about abiotic and biotic niches. Th ese criticisms can be addressed with analyses of organismal traits that underlie environmental fi ltering, competitive exclusion, and other candidate processes; however, the diffi culty of assembling large trait databases means that such studies remain uncommon. We suggest a synthesis of phylogenetic community structure analysis and species distribution modeling that we believe can allow inference about community processes without prohibitive data requirements. We illustrate this method for angiosperm communities of rock barrens in eastern Canada. First, we analyzed phylogenetic community structure of four rock-barren sites at three nested spatial scales (quadrat to region). For the nine most common species in our barrens, we used regional occurrence records to build species distribution models identifying environmental drivers of the nine species ' distributions. Coeffi cients of these models represent implicit trait data that summarize each species ' response to the environmental drivers in the model. We then tested for phylogenetic signal in these traits, to ask whether ecological forces acting on them could be generating phylogenetic community structure. We found strong phylogenetic clustering at the quadrat level, while patterns at larger scales were complex. Our distribution model suggested drought stress as the dominant driver for distributions of all the species, consistent with local correlations with soil depth, and the species ' responses to drought showed strong phylogenetic signal. Th e convergence of results from phylogenetic community structure and species distribution modeling suggests that barren communities are structured at the quadrat level by environmental fi ltering eff ects of moisture stress, to which species have phylogenetically patterned responses.",10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00459.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,"thought it was relevant at first, but get the traits from the SDM, don't use them to test hypotheses",
"Oken, KL; Essington, TE",2015,How detectable is predation in stage-structured populations? Insights from a simulation-testing analysis,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"The potential of predation to structure marine food webs is widely acknowledged. However, available tools to detect the regulation of prey population dynamics by predation are limited, partly because available population data often aggregate a population's age structure into a single biomass or abundance metric. Additionally, many food webs are relatively complex, with prey species subject to different assemblages of predators throughout their ontogeny. The goal of this study was to evaluate the extent to which stage-structured predation could be reliably detected from time series of total biomass of predators and prey. We simulated age-structured populations of four mid-trophic-level fish species with distinct life-history traits, exposed them to variable predation at different life stages and fit production models to resulting population biomass to determine how reliably the effects of predators could be detected. Predation targeting early life history and juvenile life stages generally led to larger fluctuations in annual production and was therefore more detectable. However, ecologically realistic levels of observation error and environmental stochasticity masked most predator signals. The addition of predation at a second life stage sharply decreased the ability to detect the effect of each predator. We conclude that the absence of detectable species interactions from biomass time series may be partly due to the interactive effects of environmental variability and complex food web linkages and life histories. We also note that predation signals are most robust for predator-prey systems where predators primarily act on mortality of submature life-history stages. Simulation testing can be applied widely to evaluate the statistical power of analyses to detect predation effects.",10.1111/1365-2656.12274,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Marine,Fish,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,Exploitation,0,0,1,1,"traits == age at 50% maturity, average natural morality, fishing mortality rate, stock-recruit relationship curve slope",

However, it remains unclear whether biotic niche (Eltonian) axes are also phylogenetically conserved, even though knowledge of biotic niches is essential to an understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecological communities. We conduct the first analysis of biotic PNC by evaluating dietary specialization in a vertebrate class. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe analysed two global compilations of diets of living mammals and a more detailed database for large carnivores together with a species-level phylogeny to evaluate trophic PNC. We searched for evidence of PNC by estimating the phylogenetic signal in distinct descriptors of dietary niche. ResultsTrophic niches were generally similar among related species but not strongly conserved under a niche-drift macroevolutionary model (Brownian motion). The degree of similarity in trophic niche varied among different taxonomic groups and was, importantly, even within the same group, contingent on the metric of dietary preferences used and the quality of information on the database. Main conclusionsOverall, our results showed limited support for PNC in the trophic niche of mammals. However, different data sources and metrics of dietary preferences sometimes offered different conclusions, highlighting the importance of gathering high-quality quantitative data and considering multiple metrics to describe dietary niche breadth and to assess PNC. The fully quantitative database for large carnivores provided some interesting evidence of PNC that could not be detected with semi-quantitative or presence/absence descriptors. Subsequent assessments of phylogenetic imprints on dietary specialization would benefit from considering different metrics and using well-resolved phylogenies jointly with detailed quantitative diet information.

"Olden, Julian D.; Kennard, Mark J.",2010,Intercontinental Comparison of Fish Life History Strategies along a Gradient of Hydrologic Variability,American Fisheries Society Symposiu,"The flow regime is considered the primary driver of physical processes in riverine ecosystems; thus we expect that the trait composition of fish assemblages might respond similarly to hydrologic variability, even at broad spatial scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that freshwater fish life history strategies on two continents (southern United States and eastern Australia) converge along gradients of hydrologic variability and primary productivity at the drainage scale. Our results show that the fishes of the United States and Australia conform to the three-dimensional adaptive space arising from the trade-offs among three basic demographic parameters of survival, fecundity; and onset and duration of reproductive life. Species from both continents represent the endpoints in adaptive space defining the periodic (19% versus 33% for the United States and Australia, respectively), opportunistic (69% versus 52%), and equilibrium life history strategies (12% versus 15%). We found evidence that fish life history composition of drainage basins in the two continents have converged across similar gradients of hydrologic variability and productivity despite phylogenetic and historical differences. Moreover, these relationships were largely consistent with predictions from life history theory. Increasing hydrologic variability has promoted the greater prevalence of opportunistic strategists (a strategy that should maximize fitness in environmental settings dominated by unpredictable environmental change) while concurrently minimizing the persistence of periodic-type species (a strategy typically inhabits seasonal, periodically suitable environments). Our study provides a conceptual framework of management options for species in regulated rivers because life history strategies are the underlying determinants for population responses to environmental change and therefore can be used to classify typical population responses to flow alteration or mitigation via environmental flow prescriptions.",unkown_17,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = max body length, shape factor, swim factor, substrate preference, vertical position, longevity, age at maturation, length at maturation, egg size, spawning frequency,  reprouductive guild, parental care, trophic guild, fecundity",

The objective of this study was to analyse whether an increasing proportion of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria affects (i) the composition of the non-diazotrophic component of ambient phytoplankton communities and (ii) resource use efficiency (RUE; ratio of Chl a to total nutrients) - an important ecosystem function. We hypothesize that diazotrophs increase community P use and decrease N use efficiencies, as new N is brought into the system, relaxing N, and concomitantly aggravating P limitation. We test this by analysing an extensive data set from the Baltic Sea (>3700 quantitative phytoplankton samples), known to harbour conspicuous and recurrent blooms of Nodularia spumigena and Aphanizomenon sp. System-level phosphorus use efficiency (RUEP) was positively related to high proportion of diazotrophic cyanobacteria, suggesting aggravation of phosphorus limitation. However, concomitant decrease of nitrogen use efficiency (RUEN) was not observed. Nodularia spumigena, a dominant diazotroph and a notorious toxin producer, had a significantly stronger relationship with RUEP, compared to the competing non-toxic Aphanizomenon sp., confirming niche differentiation in P acquisition strategies between the major bloom-forming cyanobacterial species in the Baltic Sea. Nodularia occurrences were associated with stronger temperature stratification in more offshore environments, indicating higher reliance on insitu P regeneration. By using constrained and unconstrained ordination, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and local similarity analysis, we show that diazotrophic cyanobacteria explained no more than a few percentage of the ambient phytoplankton community variation. The analyses furthermore yielded rather evenly distributed negative and positive effects on individual co-occurring phytoplankton taxa, with no obvious phylogenetic or functional trait-based patterns.Synthesis. Our study reveals that despite the widely acknowledged noxious impacts of cyanobacterial blooms, the overall effect on phytoplankton community structure is minor. There are no predominantly positive or negative associations with ambient phytoplankton species. Species-specific niche differences in cyanobacterial resource acquisition affect important ecosystem functions, such as biomass production per unit limiting resource.",10.1111/1365-2745.12437,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of their phylogeny, character evolution and host associations based on 10 years of sampling effort, including representatives of 12 of 15 and 44 of 66 currently recognized trypanorhynch families and genera, respectively. Using a combination of ssrDNA and 1srDNA (Domains 1-3) for 79 and 80 taxa, respectively, we maintain one-to-one correspondence between molecules and morphology by scoring 45 characters from the same specimens used for sequencing, and provide museum Vouchers for this material. Host associations are examined through likelihood-based ancestral character state reconstructions (ACSRs) and by estimating dates of divergence using strict and relaxed molecular clock models in a Bayesian context. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses of rDNA produced well-resolved and strongly supported trees in which the trypanorhynchs formed two primary lineages and were monophyletic with respect to the diphyllidean outgroup taxa. These lineages showed marked differences in their rates of divergence which in turn resulted in differing support and stability characteristics within the lineages. Mapping of morphological characters onto the tree resulting from combined analysis of rDNA showed most traits to be highly plastic, including some previously considered of key taxonomic importance such as underlying symmetries in tentacular armature. The resulting tree was found to be congruent with the most recent morphologically based superfarmily designations in the order, providing support for four proposed superfamilies, but not for the Tentacularioidea and Eutetrarhynchoidea. ACSRs based on the combined analysis of rDNA estimated the original hosts of the two primary parasite lineages to be alternatively rajiform batoids and carcharhiniform sharks. This fundamental split provides independent support for rejecting the notion that rays are derived sharks, and thus supports the most recent molecular phylogenies of the Neoselachii. Beyond the basal split between shark- and ray-inhabiting lineages, no pattern was found to suggest that the trypanorhynchs have closely tracked the evolutionary histories of these host lineages, but instead, it appears that host-switching has been common and that the subsequent evolution of the parasites has been ecologically driven primarily through overlap in the niches of their shark and ray hosts. Using a relaxed molecular clock model calibrated by means of host fossil data, the ray-inhabiting lineage is estimated to have diversified around the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, whereas the shark-inhabiting lineage is estimated to have diversified later, in the Middle Cretaceous. Although the large error associated with the estimated divergence dates prevents robust conclusions from being drawn, the dates are nevertheless found to be consistent in a relative sense with the origins of their major hosts groups. The erection and definition of the suborders Trypanobatoida and Trypanoselachoida, for the major clades of trypanorhynchs parasitizing primarily rays and sharks, respectively, is proposed for the two primary lineages recovered here.

Our study reveals differential selection at the genome level in Daphnia populations and provides evidence for repeatable patterns of local adaptation in a geographic mosaic of environmental stressors fuelled by standing genetic variation.

Understanding the drivers of these functions and their stability in response to disturbance is important given land-use intensification and the predicted increase in disturbance frequency with climate change. Changes in land use and soil abiotic conditions are likely to impact on soil ecosystem functions and their stability, but the effects of changes in soil microbial community structure (i.e. traits, diversity, composition and biomass) are poorly understood. We measured soil abiotic properties, microbial community structure, ecosystem functions (carbon and nutrient cycling) and the stability of functions in response to a dry-rewet cycle, across a land-use gradient consisting of natural forest, planted forest, high- and low-producing grassland, and vineyards. Results from additive modelling, where explanatory variables were added in a hierarchical manner and retained if significant (land use followed by abiotic variables followed by biotic variables), showed that measures of soil microbial community structure were the only variables able to explain variation in several measures of stability. In contrast, microbial community structure was rarely able to explain further variation in functions measured under static conditions once land use and abiotic factors were accounted for. Consistent with current theory, correlation analysis indicated that fungal:bacterial ratios were negatively related to measures of carbon and nutrient cycling, whereas the Gram-positive:Gram-negative ratio was positively related to measures of nutrient cycling and stability. In contrast to current theory, the fungal:bacterial ratio was negatively related to the resistance of soil water-soluble N contents to drying. Our results show that measures of microbial community structure can be good indicators of a wide range of soil functions and their stability in response to a dry-rewet cycle. Further, they suggest that soil microbial community structure may have a far greater influence on process rates under disturbed, compared to static, conditions.

We employed Generalized Additive Mixed Models to quantify the relationship between selected climate and soil depth variables, and FD.Results: More benign (deep-soil) habitats supported larger FD for foliar C:N, plant height and for multiple traits than did shallow-soil habitats.Conclusions: We suggest that: (1) functional diversification, likely aimed at avoiding intra- and interspecific competition for light and nutrients acquisition, might be the important factor in deep-soil habitats; (2) deep-soils patches on and around granite outcrops may serve as ecological microrefugia for biota associated with resource-rich environments.",10.1080/17550874.2016.1211192,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Desert,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = leaf dry matter content, foliar C-13, foliar C:N ratio, plant height and specific leaf area",
"Ottaviani, G; Tsakalos, JL; Keppel, G; Mucina, L",2018,Quantifying the effects of ecological constraints on trait expression using novel trait-gradient analysis parameters,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Complex processes related to biotic and abiotic forces can impose limitations to assembly and composition of plant communities. Quantifying the effects of these constraints on plant functional traits across environmental gradients, and among communities, remains challenging. We define ecological constraint (C-i) as the combined, limiting effect of biotic interactions and environmental filtering on trait expression (i.e., the mean value and range of functional traits). Here, we propose a set of novel parameters to quantify this constraint by extending the trait-gradient analysis (TGA) methodology. The key parameter is ecological constraint, which is dimensionless and can be measured at various scales, for example, on population and community levels. It facilitates comparing the effects of ecological constraints on trait expressions across environmental gradients, as well as within and among communities. We illustrate the implementation of the proposed parameters using the bark thickness of 14 woody species along an aridity gradient on granite outcrops in southwestern Australia. We found a positive correlation between increasing environmental stress and strength of ecological constraint on bark thickness expression. Also, plants from more stressful habitats (shrublands on shallow soils and in sun-exposed locations) displayed higher ecological constraint for bark thickness than plants in more benign habitats (woodlands on deep soils and in sheltered locations).

Daphnia, the water flea, is a textbook example for predator-induced phenotypic plastic defences; however, the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying these inducible defences is still in its early stages. We exposed Daphniamagna to chemical cues of the predator Triopscancriformis to identify key processes underlying plastic defensive trait formation. To get a more comprehensive idea of this phenomenon, we studied four genotypes with five biological replicates each, originating from habitats characterized by different predator composition, ranging from predator-free habitats to habitats containing T.cancriformis. We analysed the morphologies as well as proteomes of predator-exposed and control animals. Three genotypes showed morphological changes when the predator was present. Using a high-throughput proteomics approach, we found 294 proteins which were significantly altered in their abundance after predator exposure in a general or genotype-dependent manner. Proteins connected to genotype-dependent responses were related to the cuticle, protein synthesis and calcium binding, whereas the yolk protein vitellogenin increased in abundance in all genotypes, indicating their involvement in a more general response. Furthermore, genotype-dependent responses at the proteome level were most distinct for the only genotype that shares its habitat with Triops. Altogether, our study provides new insights concerning genotype-dependent and general molecular processes involved in predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in D.magna.",10.1111/mec.13287,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We tested the hypothesis that the presence of a primary species affects the probability of a succeeding species occurring later on the same log. Significant associations were detected for 15 species pairs; these were consistent with earlier findings on co-occurrence patterns in single time surveys. We used enrichment analysis to test if species with particular life-history attributes were more often associated with the occurrence of a succeeding species, or vice versa. White rot fungi and fungi abundant as mycelia were more often associated with the occurrence of succeeding species, compared to brown rot fungi and species with low mycelial abundance. Our results indicate that certain primary species cause priority effects and non-random co-occurrence patterns in the field.

While traits in a regional context may converge to a narrow range of values because of environmental filtering, species belonging to a guild may present contrasting traits as a means of niche differentiation, allowing coexistence whilst exploiting the same resources. To disentangle the role of external and internal filters on phenotypic diversity within ecological communities, we examined the patterns of life-history trait variation within a guild of insect parasitoids during two successive years across three contrasted regions in relation to several ecological factors. By combining a mean-field approach and an analysis of phenotypic variance across organizational levels (from individual to guild), we showed that the patterns of life-history trait variation across regions are consistent with local adaptation or adaptive phenotypic plasticity while the patterns of phenotypic variation within regions suggested how coexistence modulates life-history traits expression through niche differentiation. Within a given region, phenotypic pattern of parasitoid life-history traits may also arise from bottom-up effects of trophic webs: insect host species could also control parasitoid life-history traits in nature. Our results also showed that parasitoid life-history traits presented contrasting variation patterns according to the sampling year, suggesting temporal variations in evolutionary and ecological dynamics of parasitoid species. The application of such trait-based studies to insect parasitoids has the potential to provide further insight on how agricultural environments contribute to differential diversification among natural enemies guilds, highlighting the main role of agricultural landscape management for organisms'responses.",10.1111/1365-2435.13007,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Cereal Fields,1,1,1,1,0,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,1,1,1,"traits = amount of energy stocked in larval development, rate of energy consumption after emergence, body size.

However, whether and to what degree biodiversity influences biomass of subtropical forests remains uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the effects of tree biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity) on stand biomass at three stages (early, mid and late) of succession in subtropical forests. As forest succession progressed, we found that the changes in species diversity were different compared with those of functional and phylogenetic diversity. Most of the indices of species and functional and phylogenetic diversity were not significantly correlated with stand biomass at two spatial grains (plot sizes of 10 m x 10 m and 20 m x 30 m). However, when other abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., altitude, canopy light, stem density and forest phase) were included with diversity indices in mixed models to explain biomass, the effect of functional diversity on biomass was significant at both resolution. For species diversity indices, the effect was significant at the 20 m x 30 m resolution, and phylogenetic diversity had no significant effect. Our results indicate that biodiversity affects forest biomass during the succession of a subtropical forest and suggest that functional diversity may provide a better metric than species or phylogenetic diversity for determining the biodiversity effect on biomass. Moreover, our results indicate that the diverse conclusions reached in other BEF analyses might be explained by differences in the plot size examined and the diversity metrics selected. Because the bivariate relationship between biodiversity and biomass can be strongly confounded by covarying abiotic and biotic factors, we suggest that the effects of abiotic factors, succession stage, and management practices on BEF should be carefully considered in future research.

(1) Pile colour dimorphism in Bombus melanopygusis controlled by a single gene locus with red dominant to black. The similar red/black dimorphism in B. rufocinctusis controlled by at least two loci, with additional environmental and/or genetic modification. The red alleles are dominant and epistatic to the black ones. Tail colour dimorphism (yellow/non-yellow) is also determined by more than one locus. (2) Mullerian mimicry can account for the strong convergence in colour pattern among taxonomically heterogeneous groups of sympatric species. (3) Colour polymorphisms are not expected in Mullerian mimicry systems; however, the polymorphisms of B. melanopygusand B. rufocinctusare compatible with Mullerian mimicry. In B. melanopygusthe two morphs belong to different Mullerian mimicry rings. B. rufocinctusqueens emerge from hibernation later than other species that they resemble. Assuming that predators learn stereotyped responses to the earlier bees, then a stable polymorphism is possible. (4) In B. melanopygus,workers produced 10% of the males while the queens were alive and 39% in total. The ""reproductive success"" (based on investment ratios) of the queens and the workers was about equal. Contrary to predictions of kin selection theory, highly male-biased sex-investment ratios occurred in these colonies and also in free-foraging B. terricolacolonies. Workers in bumble bee colonies do not appear to exert more control than the queen. (5) Worker-produced males affect social hymenopteran population genetics.

We test whether the predictability of local species composition from environmental conditions is influenced by dispersal traits. We analyzed a large database with co-occurrence data, using ordination techniques (DCA and CCA) to identify the major environmental determinants of species composition. The percentage of explained variance in occurrence was quantified for individual species with CCA. Effects of life-history traits on the predictability of occurrence patterns were tested by means of regression analysis, using a generalized linear models approach. The results reveal close correlations between species composition and environmental conditions, implying that the predictability of the set of species that might occur in a given environmental setting (""habitat species pool"") is high. The habitat species pool, however, reflects the potential species composition, and not the actual local situation. At the level of individual species, a large proportion (>90%) of the variation in occurrence remained unexplained. Predictability of species occurrence patterns was increased by a greater capacity for long-distance dispersal, greater adult longevity and the capacity to build a persistent seed bank.

According to variation partitioning results, the importance of predictors varied among biological groups. Spatial predictors were particularly important for organisms with comparatively lower dispersal ability, such as aquatic macrophytes and fish. On the other hand, environmental predictors were particularly important for organisms with high dispersal ability, such as microalgae, indicating the importance of species sorting processes in shaping the community structure of these organisms. The importance of watercourse distances increased when spatial variables were the main predictors of metacommunity structure. The contribution of temporal predictors was low.

Evidence that the theory explains cycles in nature, however, is almost nonexistent. Experimental tests of model assumptions are logistically impractical for most organisms, while for others, evidence that population cycles occur in nature is lacking. For insect baculoviruses in contrast, tests of model assumptions are straightforward, and there is strong evidence that baculoviruses help drive population cycles in many insects, including the gypsy moth that we study here. We therefore used field experiments with the gypsy moth baculovirus to test two key assumptions of eco-evolutionary models of host-pathogen population cycles: that reduced host infection risk is heritable and that it is costly. Our experiments confirm both assumptions, and inserting parameters estimated from our data into eco-evolutionary insect-outbreak models gives cycles closely resembling gypsy moth outbreak cycles in North America, whereas standard models predict unrealistic stable equilibria. Our work shows that eco-evolutionary models are useful for explaining outbreaks of forest insect defoliators, while widespread observations of intense selection on defoliators in nature and of heritable and costly resistance in defoliators in the lab together suggest that eco-evolutionary dynamics may play a general role in defoliator outbreaks.",10.1086/691537,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In this study, we investigated how flower color and floral scent are related to seed predation by a seed-eating pollinator. We used field-transplanted recombinant F-2 hybrids between Silene latifolia and S. dioica that are the preferred and alternative hosts of the moth Hadena bicruris and crosses within these species for comparison. We scored seed predation and flower color and analyzed floral scent. Pinker S. dioica-like flowers and emission of a-pinene decreased the odds of seed predation while emission of benzyl acetate and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one increased the odds of seed predation. Emission of these compounds did not differ significantly between the two Silene species. Our results suggest that flower color plays an important role in the specific interaction of H. bicruris with its preferred host S. latifolia. The compounds alpha-pinene, benzyl acetate and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one could represent non-specific deterrents and attractants to ovipositing moths. Alternatively, emission of these compounds could be related to herbivory or pathogen attack and act as a signal for host quality.

Attempts to restore such complex systems require tools adapted to assess restoration success. In an analysis of invertebrate assemblages in the Rhone River floodplain (France), taxonomic-based indices (rarefied richness and assemblage composition) were compared with functional metrics using trait-based ratios as surrogates of ecosystem processes. Their ability to respond to a gradient of hydrological connectivity was assessed in 7 cut-off channels. The sampling design included 2 sites/channel (upstream and downstream), 4 randomly chosen sampling points (0.5 x 0.5-m quadrats)/site, and 2 sampling seasons (spring and summer). Water physicochemical and habitat variables were recorded when invertebrates were sampled. Environmental variables, including water conductance, [NH3-N], submerged vegetation cover, diversity of sediment grain size, and organic matter content of the sediment, were used to construct a synthetic variable describing the hydrological connectivity of each site with the main river channel. A quadratic regression of rarefied taxonomic richness and the connectivity gradient was not quite significant, but assemblage composition was strongly related to the gradient. Four of 8 trait-based metrics; were correlated with the connectivity gradient. Values of metrics that are surrogates for top-down control of assemblage structure and habitat stability (based on functional feeding groups) declined along the gradient from disconnected sites to more connected sites. Values of metrics that are surrogates for voltinism and food supply for water-column-feeding fish increased with connectivity. Top-down control and voltinism surrogates suggested a decline in predator-prey relationships and lower habitat stability, respectively, in the more connected sites. Assemblage composition and some of the trait-based metrics were sensitive to a flood that occurred before one of the sampling dates. Some of the trait-based metrics showed potential for explaining floodplain invertebrate assemblages and for monitoring postrestoration conditions in floodplain water bodies.

However, in situ studies aiming to demonstrate the link between water temperature and community structure in complex ecosystems such as large river floodplains are still rare. In particular, we have little indication about how an increase in temperature affects the density of native and invasive species within a community. Large river floodplains cover a varied range of environmental conditions, are rich in species, and therefore potentially useful ecosystems to study the effect of water temperature at the community level. Moreover, as freshwater communities are increasingly impacted by global warming and biological invasions, an improved understanding of the possible interaction between these drivers would be beneficial. First, we studied during two years the thermal heterogeneity of 36 sites in a large river (Rhone) floodplain. Second, we compared the thermal regimes of sites having different levels of hydrological connectivity with the main river channel. Third, we studied the combined and separated effects of the thermal regime and the hydrological connectivity on the presence and densities of native and non-native species of macroinvertebrates. The studied large river floodplain covered a wide range of thermal regimes, with some sites displaying a yearlong constant temperature of about 10 degrees C, whereas others experienced thermal amplitude of over 25 degrees C. The thermal regime was independent of the level of hydrological connectivity of the sites. The increase in hydrological connectivity had a significant and positive effect on the richness of non-native species within sites. The thermal regime had a positive influence on the density of non-native species but no effect on the total density of native taxa within communities. This study showed that large river floodplains possess a wide range of thermal conditions and that the increase in water temperature can have a positive influence on the presence of non-native populations of macroinvertebrates.

Individuals and species with high SLA, low wood density and small seeds tend to have faster growth rates. If community-level relationships between traits and growth have general predictive value, then similar relationships should also be observed in analyses that integrate across taxa, biogeographic regions and environments. Such global consistency would imply that traits could serve as valuable proxies for the complex suite of factors that determine growth rate, and, therefore, could underpin a new generation of robust dynamic vegetation models. Alternatively, growth rates may depend more strongly on the local environment or growth-trait relationships may vary along environmental gradients. We tested these alternative hypotheses using data on 27352 juvenile trees, representing 278 species from 27 sites on all forested continents, and extensive functional trait data, 38% of which were obtained at the same sites at which growth was assessed. Data on potential evapotranspiration (PET), which summarizes the joint ecological effects of temperature and precipitation, were obtained from a global data base. We estimated size-standardized relative height growth rates (SGR) for all species, then related them to functional traits and PET using mixed-effect models for the fastest growing species and for all species together. Both the mean and 95th percentile SGR were more strongly associated with functional traits than with PET. PET was unrelated to SGR at the global scale. SGR increased with increasing SLA and decreased with increasing wood density and seed mass, but these traits explained only 3.1% of the variation in SGR. SGR-trait relationships were consistently weak across families and biogeographic zones, and over a range of tree statures. Thus, the most widely studied functional traits in plant ecology were poor predictors of tree growth over large scales.Synthesis.

Next-generation sequencing, untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling, and interdisciplinary approaches integrating population genomics, metabolomics, and community ecology permit novel strategies to tackle this problem. We analyzed six natural populations of the disease-threatened Cornus florida L. from distinct ecological regions using genotype-by-sequencing markers and LC-MS-based untargeted metabolite profiling. We tested the hypothesis that higher genetic diversity in C.florida yielded higher chemical diversity and less disease susceptibility (screening hypothesis), and we also determined whether genetically similar subpopulations were similar in chemical composition. Most importantly, we identified metabolites that were associated with candidate loci or were predictive biomarkers of healthy or diseased plants after controlling for environment. Subpopulation clustering patterns based on genetic or chemical distances were largely congruent. While differences in genetic diversity were small among subpopulations, we did observe notable similarities in patterns between subpopulation averages of rarefied-allelic and chemical richness. More specifically, we found that the most abundant compound of a correlated group of putative terpenoid glycosides and derivatives was correlated with tree health when considering chemodiversity.

Further hypotheses suggest that plant traits related to productivity show convergence within communities, but those related to disturbance show divergence. Data on functional diversity (FDvar) of 12 traits from 30 communities ranging from arable fields, mown and grazed grasslands to moorland and woodland were employed to test this using randomisations tests and correlation and regression analysis. No traits showed consistent significant convergence or divergence in functional diversity. When correlated to measures of the environment, the most common pattern was for functional diversity to decline (7 out of 12 traits) and the degree of convergence (7 out of 12 traits) to increase as the levels of productivity (measured as primary productivity, soil nitrogen release and vegetation C:N) and disturbance increased.

"Palamara, Gian Marco; Carrara, Francesco; Smith, Matthew J.; Petchey, Owen L.",2016,The effects of demographic stochasticity and parameter uncertainty on predicting the establishment of introduced species,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Invasive species are a serious threat to biodiversity worldwide and predicting whether an introduced species will first establish and then become invasive can be useful to preserve ecosystem services. Establishment is influenced by multiple factors, such as the interactions between the introduced individuals and the resident community, and demographic and environmental stochasticity. Field observations are often incomplete or biased. This, together with an imperfect knowledge of the ecological traits of the introduced species, makes the prediction of establishment challenging. Methods that consider the combined effects of these factors on our ability to predict the establishment of an introduced species are currently lacking. We develop an inference framework to assess the combined effects of demographic stochasticity and parameter uncertainty on our ability to predict the probability of establishment following the introduction of a small number of individuals. We find that even moderate levels of demographic stochasticity influence both the probability of establishment, and, crucially, our ability to correctly predict that probability. We also find that estimation of the demographic parameters of an introduced species is fundamental to obtain precise estimates of the interaction parameters. For typical values of demographic stochasticity, the drop in our ability to predict an establishment can be 30% when having priors on the demographic parameters compared to having their accurate values. The results from our study illustrate how demographic stochasticity may bias the prediction of the probability of establishment. Our method can be applied to estimate probability of establishment of introduced species in field scenarios, where time series data and prior information on the demographic traits of the introduced species are available.",10.1002/ece3.2495,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We examine whether urban environments consistently select for plants with particular traits and the implications of such changes on the functional composition of urban floras. We classified plant recorded in 11 cities around the globe as species that have either colonized (arrived and naturalized), persisted or been lost (local extirpation) following urbanization. We analyzed how 10 traits previously linked with plant responses to environmental conditions explained membership of these three groups, by comparing colonisers with persistent and extirpated plants through individual city-level Bayesian models. Then, we used meta-analysis to assess consistency of traits across urban areas. Finally, we explored several possible scenarios of functional change using these results. On average, urban colonizers had heavier seeds, unspecialised nutrient requirements, were taller and were annual species more often, especially when compared to locally extirpated plants. Common trends of functional change in urban plant communities include shifts towards taller and heavier-seeded plants, and an increased prevalence of the short-lived species, and plants without mutualistic nutritional strategies. Our results suggest that plant traits influence the species that succeed in urban environments worldwide. Different species use different ecological strategies to live in urban environments, as suggested by the importance of several traits that may appear as trait constellations. Plant height and seed mass were the only traits associated with both colonizer and extirpated plant status in urban environments. Based on our data, predicting colonization in urban environments may be easier than identifying extirpation-prone plants; albeit some regional variation, colonization seems strongly driven by environmental conditions common to most cities (e.g. altered disturbance regimes), whereas extirpation may depend more on processes that vary across cities.",10.1111/ecog.02516,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Urban ,1,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = dispersal syndrome, growth form, longevity, clonality, nutrient uptake strategy, photosynthetic pathway, spinescence, pollination syndrome, plant height, seed mass",

Kingdon [1974, 1980] suggested that circumperineal skin coloration is functionally related to terrestriality, but this hypothesis has not been tested. From the literature, we collected data on habitat use (terrestrial/arboreal) and circumperineal coloration (present/absent) for 78 species. Indeed, among the 78 species surveyed here, 75% of them fall into either the category of colored circumperineals with terrestrial lifestyle, or of uncolored circumperineals with arboreal lifestyle ((2)(1)=19.550, P<0.001). However, conventional statistical procedures assume all taxa are equally relatedwhich is not usually the case in multispecies analysesleading to higher rates of both type I and II statistical errors. We performed Bayesian trait coevolution analyses that show that models of dependent trait evolution are not significantly better than models assuming independent evolution of the two traits (log-likelihood ratio test P=0.396, Bayes Factor=1). Bayesian nodal reconstructions of the cercopithecoid phylogeny indicate that relatively few trait transitions are needed to account for the distributions of the two traits. Further, chi-squared distributional tests show that sub-family affiliation (i.e., Cercopithecinae, Colobinae) is an accurate predictor of trait status.

Which of these invasive species will alter or even reshape their new environment? The answers to these questions are simultaneously critical and complex. They are critical because invasive species can spectacularly alter their new environment, leading to native species extinctions or loss of important ecosystem functions that fundamentally reduce environmental and societal services. They are complex because invasion success in a novel environment is influenced by various attributes embedded in natural landscapes-biogeographical landscape properties, abiotic environmental characteristics, and the relationship between the invasive species and the resident species present in the new environment. We explore whether a condensed record of the relationships among species, in the form of a network, contains the information needed to understand and predict invasive species success and subsequent impacts. Applying network theory to study invasive species is a relatively novel approach. For this reason, much research will be needed to incorporate existing ecological properties into a network framework and to identify which network features hold the information needed to understand and predict whether or not an invasive species is likely to establish or come to dominate a novel environment. This paper asks and begins to answer the 14 most important questions that biologists must address to integrate network analysis into the study of invasive species.

Pre-emptive measures to prevent potential invasive species from reaching new habitats are the most economically and environmentally efficient form of management. Darwin's naturalization hypothesis predicts that invaders less related to native flora are more likely to be successful than those that are closely related to natives. Here we test this hypothesis, using the weed-rich thistle tribe, Cardueae, in the California Floristic Province, a biodiversity hotspot, as our study system. An exhaustive molecular phylogenetic approach was used, generating and examining more than 100,000 likely phylogenies of the tribe based on nuclear and chloroplast DNA markers, representing the most in-depth reconstruction of the clade to date. Branch lengths separating invasive and noninvasive introduced taxa from native California taxa were used to represent phylogenetic distances between these groups and were compared at multiple biogeographical scales to ascertain whether invasive thistles are more or less closely related to natives than noninvasive introduced thistles are. Patterns within this highly supported clade show that not only are introduced thistles more closely related to natives more likely to be invasive, but these invasive species are also evolutionarily closer to native flora than by chance. This suggests that preadaptive traits are important in determining an invader's success. Such rigorous molecular phylogenetic analyses may prove a fruitful means for furthering our understanding of biological invasions and developing predictive frameworks for screening potential invasive taxa.",10.1073/pnas.1309948110,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We provide an overview among ungulates of the extent of these influences resulting from interactions among bioenergetics, foraging, and nutritional demands. Body condition of an animal is the integrator of nutritional intake and demands, affecting both survival and reproduction. The deposition and mobilization of body fat and body protein vary with physiological requirements and environmental conditions as species use dietary income and body stores to integrate the profits of summer and the demands of winter. Results from our simulation model and uncertainty analysis of the influence of body mass and changes in body composition of Rangifer over winter indicate that percent body fat rather than body mass in early winter is most important in determining whether animals die, live without reproducing, or live and reproduce. Animal responses are also sensitive to rates of change in body protein. Depending on timing of calving and maternal reserves, seasonal habitats vary in their nutritional value for the production of offspring. For free-ranging animals, life is a balance among numerous ecological factors, including nutritional requirements, nutritional resources to meet those demands, and intra- and inter-specific interactions. Predation effects on population demography may mask nutritional limitations of habitat. We suggest that over the long term of life histories, ungulates use seasonal strategies that minimize the maximum detriment, and that the basis for most strategies is nutritional.",10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01528.x,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Mammals,Polar,1,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = nutritional requirements, body mass, body fat  %, body protein%, ",

Here, we explore a framework to identify the species and clades responsible for the inferred patterns of phylogenetic structure within a given community. Further, we evaluate how communities that share the nonrandom representation of species from a given clade in the phylogeny are distributed across geography and environmental gradients. Using Ecuadorian hummingbird communities, we found that multiple patterns of phylogenetic structure often occur within a local assemblage. We also identified four geographic regions where species from certain clades exhibit nonrandom representation: the eastern Amazonian lowlands, the western dry lowlands, the Andes at middle elevations, and the Andes at high elevations. The environmental gradients along which changes in the local coexistence of species occurred were mainly elevation, annual precipitation, and seasonality in both temperature and precipitation.

Data corresponding to Colombian euglossine species were ordered with a correspondence analysis and with subsequent hierarchical clustering.

From this analysis, we derived a model that classifies the territory of Colombia into 11 biogeographic units or natural clusters.

However, the stochastic nature of demographic processes can also generate considerable variation in fitness-related traits among otherwise-identical individuals. An improved understanding of life-history evolution and population dynamics therefore depends on evaluating the relative role of each of these processes. Here, we used a 33-yr data set with reproductive histories for 1,274 female Weddell seals from Erebus Bay, Antarctica, to assess the strength of evidence for among-individual heterogeneity in the probabilities of survival and reproduction, while accounting for multiple other sources of variation in vital rates. Our analysis used recent advances in Bayesian model selection techniques and diagnostics to directly compare model fit and predictive power between models that included individual effects on survival and reproduction to those that did not. We found strong evidence for costs of reproduction to both survival and future reproduction, with breeders having rates of survival and subsequent reproduction that were 3% and 6% lower than rates for non-breeders. We detected age-related changes in the rates of survival and reproduction, but the patterns differed for the two rates. Survival rates steadily declined from 0.92 at age 7 to 0.56 at the maximal age of 31yr. In contrast, reproductive rates increased from 0.68 at age 7 to 0.79 at age 16 and then steadily declined to 0.37 for the oldest females. Models that included individual effects explained more variation in observed life histories and had better estimated predictive power than those that did not, indicating their importance in understanding sources of variation among individuals in life-history traits. We found that among-individual heterogeneity in survival was small relative to that for reproduction.

Despite these specific life-history traits, large-scale biogeographic patterns in bryophytes are consistent with those observed in other groups, wherein they have been interpreted in terms of historical factors. Comparative phylogeographic analyses in bryophytes and angiosperms suggest, however, that spatially congruent patterns may not necessarily arise from common processes. This is best illustrated by the strikingly lower rates of endemism at all taxonomic and spatial scales in bryophytes due to their failure to diversify in-situ and the rapidity at which they enlarge their distribution range. In particular, the striking transoceanic disjunctions that are typical for many bryophyte species and their low community turnover at broad geographic scales both point to the higher capacities of bryophytes for long-distance dispersal than angiosperms. Such high long-distance dispersal capacities are reflected in the lower spatial genetic structure of bryophytes as compared to angiosperms at large geographic scales. This explains why, as opposed to the expectations of MacArthur & Wilson's model, bryophyte species richness is not necessarily lower on islands than on continents, suggesting that community assembly is more constrained by ecological filtering than dispersal limitations in bryophytes. The low relevance of historical factors for global patterns of bryophyte species richness has contributed to the idea that, as opposed to the predictions of one of the most general rules in ecology, bryophyte species richness does not decrease with latitude due to a strong tropical niche conservatism. Recent evidence for the existence of a latitudinal species richness gradient in bryophytes raises, however, the question of why bryophytes diversified faster in the tropics.

We then used these models to predict flow metrics in 842 ungauged stream sites in the mid-Atlantic United States that were sampled for fish, macroinvertebrates, and environmental covariates. Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages were characterized in terms of a suite of metrics that quantified aspects of community composition, diversity, and functional traits that were expected to be associated with differences in flow characteristics. We related modeled flow metrics to biological metrics in a series of stressor-response models. Our analyses identified both drying and base flow instability as explaining 30-50% of the observed variability in fish and invertebrate community composition. Variations in community composition were related to variations in the prevalence of dispersal traits in invertebrates and trophic guilds in fish.

We interpret the results to mean that functional diversity can play an important role in driving -diversity; however, within guilds the nature of interspecific interactions and species pool size complicate the relationship.

Furthermore, although much theoretical and empirical work assumes selection shapes variation in personalities, studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of personality traits are rare.

Using generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable and heritable. We also find strong differences in boldness between breeding colonies, which vary in size and density, suggesting birds are shyer in more dense colonies.

The set of species growing in fire-prone communities has been filtered. in such a way that species without fire-persistence traits have not successfully entered the community. Because plant traits are evolutionarily conserved and. re traits are correlated with other plant traits, communities under high. re frequency should not include all possible trait combinations, and thus the morphospace occupation by species in these communities should be lower than expected by chance (underoccupied). In contrast, communities under low. re frequency would lack the filtering factor, and thus their underoccupation of the morphospace is not expected. We test this prediction by comparing the morphospace occupation by species in communities located in the western Mediterranean Basin, five of them subject to high. re frequency (HiFi) and four to low. re frequency (LowFi). We first compile a set of morphological and functional traits for the species growing on the nine sites, then we compute the morphospace occupation of each site as a convex hull volume, and finally, to assert that our results are not a product of a random branching pattern of evolution, we simulate our traits under a null model of neutral evolution and compare the morphospace occupation of the simulated traits with the results from the empirical data. The results suggest that, as predicted, there is a clear differential morphospace occupation between communities under different. re regimes in such a way that the morphospace is underoccupied in HiFi communities only. The simulation of a neutral evolutionary model does not replicate the observed pattern of differential morphospace occupation, and thus it should be attributed to assembly processes.

Information on species traits of the higher plants comprising the Rhone floodplain vegetation was based on studies conducted between Geneva, Switzerland, and Lyon, France. 2. These data were structured using a 'fuzzy coding' technique and then examined using ordination analyses to investigate: (i) relationships among species traits; (ii) habitat utilization; (iii) the relationship between species traits and habitat utilization; and (iv) trends of species traits and species richness in the framework of,spatial-temporal habitat variability to test predictions of the river habitat templet and the patch dynamics concept. 3. Size, number of descendants per reproductive cycle, number of reproductive cycles per individual, and the regeneration potential of an individual were positively related with each other, whereas the degree of attachment to the soil decreased, and the reproductive period shifted from autumn/late summer towards early summer/spring, as size increased. 4. The habitat utilization by the higher plants of the floodplain revealed a double lateral gradient: the first was from the banks of the temporary waters to terrestrial flats; the second from aggrading pebble to aggrading silt habitats. These gradients were related to gradients in water saturation, oxygen conditions, nutrient loading, and nutrient retention of the soils. 5. A significant relationship between species traits and habitat utilization was observed for the floodplain vegetation, i.e. plant communities used particular habitat types with a particular set of species trait modalities (= categories). 6. Patterns of species trait modalities were significantly related to temporal and spatial habitat variability but only modalities of the trait 'parental care' conformed to trends predicted from theory. 7. No trends were observed when species richness of different habitat types was considered in the framework of spatial-temporal habitat variability. 8. Although the habitats of the Upper Rhone clearly act as a templet for the species traits of the floodplain vegetation, the lack of agreement between observations and predictions on trends in species traits and richness in terms of habitat variability suggest that important elements of theory should be rejected.

We propose a new methodology in which trait diversity is measured by the quadratic entropy index, with distances among species calculated from differences among trait states. We show how this index of trait diversity can be decomposed among the nodes of a phylogenetic tree. The contribution to trait diversity of a particular node is equal to the trait diversity among the n groups of species descending from it multiplied by an abundance weight (either proportional to the number of descendant species or to their relative abundance). We developed three tests to characterize the phylogenetic pattern of trait diversity and evaluated our methodology with seven evolutionary models. The power of the tests was high and increased with the number of extant taxa and the number of traits analyzed. The Type I error analyses (erroneous rejection of true null hypotheses) suggested that our tests are neither too liberal nor too conservative. Species abundances were found to modify the phylogenetic signal in trait diversity if only a few species were abundant and if species abundances were correlated to their phylogenetic relatedness and/or their trait states. By comparing phylogenetic signals in trait diversity from the local to the metacommunity level, we explored the factors that structure butterfly trait diversity in calcareous grasslands of northern France and southern Belgium. We show that partial phylogenetic signal in traits combined with habitat filtering determined which species and lineages were able to co-occur locally. Interestingly, no phylogenetic signal was detected when measures of abundance were included in our analyses. For most species and clades, the abundance distribution among communities at the regional scale was random. Overall, studying trait diversity in a phylogenetic context allows the link between current local ecological processes and lineage-dependent historical evolutionary factors to be thoroughly investigated.",10.1890/09-1290.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Using butterfly communities in a fragmented landscape, we tested the hypothesis that local environmental filtering drives character convergences in traits of species belonging to different clades. We found that, while many traits were determined both by phylogeny and environment, trait convergence within the phylogeny was extensive and eroded the phylogenetic structure associated with habitat use. Traits associated with habitat use are shown to be only moderately phylogenetically conserved in chalk grassland butterfly assemblages, and further analysis revealed that traits associated with environmental filtering may be highly labile rather than phylogenetically conserved. In general, a significant phylogenetic signal is therefore neither sufficient to demonstrate a lack of trait convergence, nor to determine whether communities are likely to be phylogenetically structured.

"Pavoine, S; Bonsall, MB",2011,Measuring biodiversity to explain community assembly: a unified approach,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,"One of the oldest challenges in ecology is to understand the processes that underpin the composition of communities. Historically, an obvious way in which to describe community compositions has been diversity in terms of the number and abundances of species. However, the failure to reject contradictory models has led to communities now being characterized by trait and phylogenetic diversities. Our objective here is to demonstrate how species, trait and phylogenetic diversity can be combined together from large to local spatial scales to reveal the historical, deterministic and stochastic processes that impact the compositions of local communities. Research in this area has recently been advanced by the development of mathematical measures that incorporate trait dissimilarities and phylogenetic relatedness between species. However, measures of trait diversity have been developed independently of phylogenetic measures and conversely most of the phylogenetic diversity measures have been developed independently of trait diversity measures. This has led to semantic confusions particularly when classical ecological and evolutionary approaches are integrated so closely together. Consequently, we propose a unified semantic framework and demonstrate the importance of the links among species, phylogenetic and trait diversity indices. Furthermore, species, trait and phylogenetic diversity indices differ in the ways they can be used across different spatial scales. The connections between large-scale, regional and local processes allow the consideration of historical factors in addition to local ecological deterministic or stochastic processes. Phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used in large-scale analyses to determine how historical and/or environmental factors affect both the formation of species assemblages and patterns in species richness across latitude or elevation gradients. Both phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used at different spatial scales to identify the relative impacts of ecological deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and limiting similarity from alternative processes such as random speciation and extinction, random dispersal and ecological drift. Measures of phylogenetic diversity combine phenotypic and genetic diversity and have the potential to reveal both the ecological and historical factors that impact local communities. Consequently, we demonstrate that, when used in a comparative way, species, trait and phylogenetic structures have the potential to reveal essential details that might act simultaneously in the assembly of species communities. We highlight potential directions for future research. These might include how variation in trait and phylogenetic diversity alters with spatial distances, the role of trait and phylogenetic diversity in global-scale gradients, the connections between traits and phylogeny, the importance of trait rarity and independent evolutionary history in community assembly, the loss of trait and phylogenetic diversity due to human impacts, and the mathematical developments of biodiversity indices including within-species variations.",10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00171.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,no testing of question,
"Pavoine, S; Bonsall, MB; Dupaix, A; Jacob, U; Ricotta, C",2017,From phylogenetic to functional originality: Guide through indices and new developments,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"In biodiversity studies a species is often classified as original when it has few closely related species, a definition that reflects its phylogenetic originality. More recently, studies have focussed on biological or functional traits that reflect the role(s) that species play within communities and ecosystems. This has led many studies to an alternative evaluation of species' originality: its functional originality. Most indices of species' originality were developed to treat the hierarchical structure of a (phylogenetic) tree. The change in perspective from measures of phylogenetic originality to measures of functional originality thus raises methodological issues particularly around the need to develop indices explicitly appropriate for evaluating functional trait-based originality. We compare indices of species' originality including a new index which we develop to evaluate (1) whether phylogenetic originality could serve as a proxy for functional originality in conservation and ecological studies; (2) whether the transformation of functional data into functional trees modifies the way species are ranked according to their originality measures compared to approaches that directly rely on pairwise functional dissimilarities among species; and more generally, (3) whether different indices provide different views on how original species are from each other, hence reflecting different ecological and evolutionary processes that generated patterns of originality. Using simulations and a real case study, we show that: (1) the strong effects of the choice of a clustering approach can affect reported levels of dissimilarities among species; (2) the tree-based approaches could better reflect the trait-generating processes under constant (Brownian) rates of evolution; and (3) phylogenetic originality measures can depart from functional originality measures when species have large amount of independent evolution. Overall, phylogenies may be used at large scales but cannot replace functional approaches designed for depicting community assembly. Indeed, traits involved in ecological processes may have various histories and thus moderate phylogenetic signals.

"Pavoine, S; Marcon, E; Ricotta, C",2016,"Equivalent numbers' for species, phylogenetic or functional diversity in a nested hierarchy of multiple scales",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Many recent studies have searched to integrate species' functions and phylogenies in the measurement of biodiversity. To obtain easily interpretable measures, some researchers recommended diversity indices expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species: the number of equally likely and maximally dissimilar species needed to produce the given value of diversity. Then, biodiversity is often calculated at three scales: within communities (alpha diversity), among communities (beta diversity) and in a region (gamma diversity). These three scales are, however, insufficient to tackle the organization of biodiversity in space because, for most organisms, there is a nested hierarchy of multiple scales characterized by different patterns and processes, from the small neighbourhood to the biosphere. 2. We developed methodologies for analysing species, functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity in a hierarchy of multiple scales using equivalent numbers of species. As an example, we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Loire River, France, at four levels: within sites (alpha diversity), among sites within geological regions (beta(1) diversity), among geological regions (beta(2) diversity) and at the river scale (gamma diversity). The new hierarchical approaches of biodiversity revealed very low differences among sites within regions and among regions in terms of taxonomy and functional traits (size and diet), despite moderate, significant species turnover among geological regions. 3. We compare our framework with those other authors have developed. We argue that different definitions of alpha, beta, gamma diversities are used in the literature reflecting different points of view on biodiversity. We make recommendations on how to normalize functional (or phylogenetic) dissimilarities among species to render sites and regions comparable, and discuss the pros and cons of our approach. 4. The hierarchical approaches of biodiversity in terms of 'equivalent numbers' respond to current demands to obtain intuitive, easily interpretable components of biodiversity. The approaches we propose go beyond current developments by considering a hierarchy of spatial scales and unbalanced sampling design.

We introduce a novel method that analyses environmental filtering of plant species in a geographic and phylogenetic context. By connecting species traits with phylogeny, traits with environment, and environment with geography, this comprehensive approach partitions the ecological and evolutionary processes that influence community assembly. 2. Our analysis extends RLQ ordination, which connects site attributes in matrix R (here environmental variables and spatial positions) with species attributes in matrix Q (here biological traits and phylogenetic positions), through the composition of sites in terms of species presences or abundances (matrix L). This methodology, which explores and identifies environmental filters that organize communities, was developed to answer four questions: which combinations of trait states are filtered by the environment, which lineages are affected by these filters, which environmental variables contribute to the assemblage of local communities and where do these filters act? 3. At La Mafragh in north-eastern Algeria, our approach shows that plant species traits were distributed according to environmental filters associated with a salinity gradient. Traits associated with the salinity gradient were convergent among Juncaceae, Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae. The observed phylogenetic and trait patterns were related to how species survived the xeric season. Juncaceae and Cyperaceae, being perennials and anemogamous, tolerate the xeric hot season by restricting their range to the humid centre of the study area (where conditions are close to a subtropical climate). Several Amaranthaceae species co-occur with the Juncaceae and Cyperaceae in two areas with the highest salinity. Most dicots were observed at higher elevations (up to 7 m a.s.l.), had hairy structures that can retain water and reflect solar radiation and were mostly annual or biennial, completing their life cycle before the onset of the xeric season. 4. Synthesis. Our methodology describes environmental filters in terms of identified combinations of traits and environmental factors. It allows spatial and phylogenetic signals to be determined by identifying convergent and conserved patterns in the evolution of traits and spatial scales that structured the environment.

Such ""nonlethal"" predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging. We present new empirical work, and review previous work, on larval-anuran growth that is in general support of model predictions.

PCBs have a long biological half-life and high liposolubility which leads to their bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food chains over a wide range of trophic levels. Exposure can lead to changes in animal physiology and behavior and has been demonstrated in both experimental and field analyses. There are also potential risks to high trophic level predators, including humans. A maternal transfer has been demonstrated in fish as PCBs bind to lipids in eggs. In this study, behavioral traits (exploration and free swimming, with or without challenges) of contaminated zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults and their offspring (both as five-day-old larvae and as two-month-old fish reared under standard conditions) were measured using video-tracking. Long-term dietary exposure to a mixture of non-coplanar PCBs was used to mimic known environmental contamination levels and congener composition. Eight-week-old fish were exposed for eight months at 26-28 degrees C. Those exposed to an intermediate dose (equivalent to that found in the Loire Estuary, Sigma(CB) = 515 ng g(-1) dry weight in food) displayed behavioral disruption in exploration capacities. Fish exposed to the highest dose (equivalent to that found in the Seine Estuary, Sigma(CB) = 2302 ng g(-1), dry weight in food) displayed an increased swimming activity at the end of the night. In offspring, larval activity was increased and two-month-old fish occupied the bottom section of the tank less often. These findings call for more long-term experiments using the zebrafish model; the mechanisms underlying behavioral disruptions need to be understood due to their implications for both human health and their ecological relevance in terms of individual fitness and survival.

"Pearse, WD; Jones, FA; Purvis, A",2013,Barro Colorado Island's phylogenetic assemblage structure across fine spatial scales and among clades of different ages,ECOLOGY,"Phylogenetic analyses of assemblage membership provide insight into how ecological communities are structured. However, despite the scale-dependency of many ecological processes, little is known about how assemblage and source pool size definitions can be altered, either alone or together, to provide insight into how ecological diversity is maintained. Moreover, although studies have acknowledged that different clades within an assemblage may be structured by different forces, there has been no attempt to relate the age of a clade to its community phylogenetic structure. Using assemblage phylogenies and spatially explicit data for trees from Barro Colorado Island (BCI), we show that larger assemblages, and assemblages with larger source pools, are more phylogenetically clustered. We argue that this reflects competition, the influence of pathogens, and chance assembly at smaller spatial scales, all operating within the context of wider-scale habitat filtering. A community phylogenetic measure that is based on a null model derived explicitly from trait evolution theory, D, is better able to detect these differences than commonly used measures such as SESMPD and SESMNTD. We also detect a moderate tendency for stronger phylogenetic clustering in younger clades, which suggests that coarse analyses of diverse assemblages may be missing important variation among clades.

Total species richness appeared comparable to molecular studies of temperate forests. Community structure changed across the ecotone, although it was not possible to separate the role of environmental factors vs host plant preferences.

Yet, little is known about the degree to which empirical trait responses found for one taxonomic group can be generalized across organisms. In this study, we investigated the spatial variability of marine community-weighted mean traits and compared their environmental responses across multiple taxa and habitats, including pelagic zooplankton (copepods), demersal fish, and benthic infaunal invertebrates. We used extensive, spatially explicit datasets collected from scientific surveys in the North Sea and examined community composition of these groups using a trait-based approach. In order to cover the key biological characteristics of an organism, we considered three life-history traits (adult size, offspring size, and fecundity) and taxon-specific feeding traits. While many of the traits co-varied in space and notably demonstrated a south-north gradient, none of the traits showed a consistent spatial distribution across all groups. However, traits are often correlated as a result of trade-offs. When studying spatial patterns of multiple traits variability in fish and copepods, we showed a high spatial correlation. This also applied to a lesser extent to fish and benthic infauna, whereas no correlation was found between benthic infauna and copepods. The result suggested a decoupling in the community traits between strictly benthic and strictly pelagic species. The strongest drivers of spatial variability for many community traits are the gradients in temperature seasonality, primary productivity, fishing effort, and depth. Spatial variability in benthic traits also co-varied with descriptors of the seabed habitat. Overall, results showed that trait responses to environmental gradients cannot be generalized across organism groups, pointing toward potential complex responses of multi-taxa communities to environmental changes and highlighting the need for cross-habitat multi-trait analyses to foresee how environmental change will affect community structure and biodiversity at large.",10.1002/ecs2.2460,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Marine,Broad,Continental Shelf,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = adult size, fecundity, offspring size, feeding method, diet",

For example, in specialised snake-eating snakes, the predator is unaffetced by the venom of the prey. We predicted that similar adaptations should have evolved in spider-eating (araneophagous) spiders. We investigated potential and actual prey of two Palpimanus spiders (P. gibbulus, P. orientalis) to support the prediction that these are araneophagous predators. Specific behavioural adaptations were investigated using a high-speed camera during staged encounters with prey, while morphological adaptations were investigated using electron microscopy. Both Palpimanus species captured a wide assortment of spider species from various guilds but also a few insect species. Analysis of the potential prey suggested that Palpimanus is a retreat-invading predator that actively searches for spiders that hide in a retreat. Behavioural capture adaptations include a slow, stealthy approach to the prey followed by a very fast attack. Morphological capture adaptations include scopulae on forelegs used in grabbing prey body parts, stout forelegs to hold the prey firmly, and an extremely thick cuticle all over the body preventing injury from a counter bite of the prey. Palpimanus overwhelmed prey that was more than 200% larger than itself. In trials with another araneophagous spider, Cyrba algerina (Salticidae), Palpimanus captured C. algerina in more than 90% of cases independent of the size ratio between the spiders.

As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb.

"Pellmyr, O",1997,Pollinating seed eaters: Why is active pollination so rare?,ECOLOGY,"Insects whose larvae depend on developing seed are very common, but active pollination, meaning that the insect possesses specific structures and behaviors for the purpose of assuring pollination, is only known to have evolved twice in such insects, namely in yucca moths and in fig wasps. This rarity could be due to high cost of pollination, phylogenetic constraints, alternative life history shifts to reduce or avoid risk of seed nondevelopment, or ecological factors such as co-pollinators that can satiate pollen requirements and mask variation in pollinator effectiveness among ovipositing seed eaters. Ecological costs of being a pollinator were measured for a yucca moth species and were found to be low: active time allocated to pollen pickup and deposit was on average 4.1%, an average of 0.42% of female body mass was allocated to specific structures for pollen manipulation, and the average pollen load weighed <4% of moth body mass. These estimates suggest that ecological costs need not be a major obstacle to evolution of active pollination. In contrast, recent combined ecological-phylogenetic analyses for the yucca moth family suggest that the evolution of active pollination and transition to mutualism depended largely on preadaptations, and that few traits were truly novel. If general, active pollination would be predicted to be likely to evolve only in lineages with life histories that facilitate mutualism. Alternative outcomes to evolution of active pollination include delayed oviposition, detection of floral pollination status, egg placement that allows the larva to select a fruit, and modified egg dispersion strategies to balance the cost of pollination. The historical significance of these factors can be assessed only when mechanisms are documented in many lineages and analyzed in a phylogenetic framework.Active fungal inoculation among arthropods is ecologically analogous to active pollination, and offers a complement for comparative analyses. Specific structures for spore transport have evolved many times in at least three orders of insects, and several times in mites. The large number of independent lineages of active pollen and fungus dispersers jointly provide a platform for testing hypotheses about, e.g., the role of preadaptations in evolution of mutualism, reversals of mutualism, and the role of mutualism in diversification.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Pellmyr, O; Leebens-Mack, J",2000,Reversal of mutualism as a mechanism for adaptive radiation in yucca moths,AMERICAN NATURALIST,"Species interactions are a major source of adaptive radiation. In mutualisms, such diversification can take the form of evolution of parasites that exploit the resources needed for maintenance of the mutualism. Mutualistic associations often have associated parasitic species, and in some cases, parasitic species have indeed evolved from the mutualists. For example, obligate mutualisms, such as those involving seed-eating pollinators, have on a few occasions given rise to nonmutualist species. These systems are relatively simple and provide models for identifying factors that facilitate the stable reversal of a mutualistic interaction. We used ecological data in a phylogenetic framework to analyze the origins of two nonmutualist cheater yucca moths. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of cheating may be preceded by a change in oviposition behavior. Two different modes of oviposition among math species cause density-dependent moth egg mortality through flower abscission in one case (locule-ovipositing species) but density-independent mortality in the other (superficially ovipositing species). A mtDNA-based phylogeny indicated that cheating and superficial oviposition have evolved twice each and that the cheater clades are sisters to the superficially ovipositing species clades. Consideration of the fitness consequences of two trait changes-loss of pollination and phenological delay in oviposition-in which cheaters have diverged from ancestral pollinators suggest that the shift to oviposition into fruit may have occurred first and that loss of pollination behavior was a secondary event. We suggest that secondary coexistence of two pollinator species of opposite oviposition modes may facilitate the shift to fruit oviposition and cheating and that this is applicable in the best documented of the cheater lucca moths. Superficially ovipositing species suffer dual sources of egg mortality when in coexistence with locule-ovipositing species. Shift to fruit oviposition under this circumstance can be facilitated by access to a seed resource not available to the copollinator, preadaptations in ovipositor morphology, and pollinator phenology late relative to the copollinator. Thus the adaptive radiation of nonmutualists from mutualists may have taken place in specific ecological contexts through few trait changes, and the reversal of mutualism would be a by-product of a shift to reliance on a previously inaccessible seed resource.",10.1086/303416,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Pellock, S.; Thompson, A.; He, K. S.; Mecklin, C. J.; Yang, Jie",2013,Validity of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis relates to the stages of invasion,COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,"Naturalization is the introduction and establishment of a nonnative species with sustainable populations in a novel environment. The success of nonnative species may be influenced by their relatedness to the native flora. Darwin proposed that if a nonnative plant species is introduced into an environment without native congeners, the nonnative species will have a greater chance of becoming naturalized. To test Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, we compiled a Kentucky plant database consisting of 821 vascular plant species and subsequently selected species traits and distribution information to determine the effect of congeneric species and traits on the probability of successful naturalization and invasion. The predictors used include reproductive traits, growth form, abundance, habitat type, native congeners, and biogeographical origin. We fit three sets of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial family and a logit link. Backward selection based on minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used in the analyses. Our results from these three sets of models clearly indicate that the validity of Darwin's hypothesis is invasion stage dependent. More specific, the naturalized and invasive models (predicting the probability of being naturalized and invasive respectively) did not support Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. The number of native congeners had no effect on the likelihood that a particular species would naturalize and become invasive. Our results suggest that Darwin's naturalization hypothesis is more relevant during the early stage of establishment as demonstrated by the native model (predicting the probability of being native) and it becomes irrelevant during the late stages of invasion as indicated by the naturalized and invasive models. Thus, it can be generalized that biotic interactions, especially competition, is a critical determinant of initial success for nonnative species in the recipient communities. Once established, the fate of nonnative species during the late stages of invasion may be more related to other factors such as biogeographic origin and habitat conditions. Furthermore, we found reproductive traits such as flowering phenology and flower type are associated with invasion success. We also recognized contrasting traits between native and nonnative species, indicating niche differentiation between these two groups of species. Niche overlapping was found as well among species regardless of the status of being native or otherwise.

Microevolution analyses, including genomic and experimental approaches, are so far very scarce for non-pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we compare the genomes, metabolomes and selected ecological traits of the strains M8 and M31 of the hyperhalophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber that contain ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and intergenic regions that are identical in sequence and were simultaneously isolated from a Mediterranean solar saltern. Comparative analyses indicate that S. ruber genomes present a mosaic structure with conserved and hypervariable regions (HVRs). The HVRs or genomic islands, are enriched in transposases, genes related to surface properties, strain-specific genes and highly divergent orthologous. However, the many indels outside the HVRs indicate that genome plasticity extends beyond them. Overall, 10% of the genes encoded in the M8 genome are absent from M31 and could stem from recent acquisitions. S. ruber genomes also harbor 34 genes located outside HVRs that are transcribed during standard growth and probably derive from lateral gene transfers with Archaea preceding the M8/M31 divergence. Metabolomic analyses, phage susceptibility and competition experiments indicate that these genomic differences cannot be considered neutral from an ecological perspective. The results point to the avoidance of competition by micro-niche adaptation and response to viral predation as putative major forces that drive microevolution within these Salinibacter strains. In addition, this work highlights the extent of bacterial functional diversity and environmental adaptation, beyond the resolution of the 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacers regions.

Actually, multiple species may simultaneously respond to environmental changes, for example, global warming, leading a series of dynamical communities toward the advancing front. We investigated multiple species range expansions through the analysis of a two-species dispersion model and simulations of multiple species assemblages regulated by neutral and fecundity-survival trade-offs (FSTs), respectively, and found that species assemblages regulated by different mechanisms would initiate different expanding patterns in geographic ranges in response to environmental changes. The neutral model generally predicts a higher biodiversity near the core of an expanding range, and a lower community similarity compared with a FST model. Without considering the evolution of life history traits, an assortment of the reproduction ability happens at the advancing front under FSTs at the expense of a higher death rate or lower competitive ability.

We hypothesized that these interaction outcomes could be predicted by ant and plant traits and habitat, with outcomes falling along a gradient of cost and benefit to the plant. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a global literature review and classified over 6,000 pairs of ant-seed interactions from 753 studies across six continents. Linear models showed that seed and ant size, habitat, and dispersal syndrome were the most consistent predictors. Predation was less likely than parasitism and seed dispersal among myrmecochorous plants. A classification tree of the predicted outcomes from linear models revealed that dispersal and predation formed distinct categories based on habitat, ant size, and dispersal mode, with parasitism outcomes forming a distinct subgroup of predation based on seed size and shape. Multiple correspondence analysis indicated some combinations of ant genera and plant families were strongly associated with particular outcomes, whereas other ant-seed combinations were much more variable.

Community-level studies also allow us to apply trait-based analyses that are crucial for a better understanding of the functioning of amphibian communities and metacommunities. In two years with contrasting rainfall (2012 and 2013), we found amphibian species in 85 different waterbodies of a heterogeneous landscape in Central Europe (Hungary). Within the metacommunity framework, the contributions of local, landscape and spatial variables to community assembly were assessed. We also measured the local extinction-colonisation rates in the ponds for all species between the two years. To investigate the role of dispersal traits in explaining the spatial distribution of species, we studied the relationship between body size and the pure spatial fraction of variation. According to our results, the main drivers were the same in both the dry and wet year, but their relative contribution changed. Local variables played a predominant role in the assembly of the amphibian metacommunity. Spatial signals were more evident in the dry year. This implies not only the adverse effect of decreased connectivity due to the drying out of several habitats but also a loss of breeding sites for the studied amphibians. Local colonisation rates were higher in primarily terrestrial species (Hyla arborea, Pelobates fuscus, Bufo bufo) which only visit ponds during breeding. We found a negative relationship between the pure spatial effect and body size, suggesting an increased level of dispersal limitation in small-bodied species. Our results showed that while the strength and relative role of local and spatial processes changed between years, the role of dispersal traits in explaining the spatial distribution of species was similar. Specialisation to different habitats seems to be a major process in determining vertebrate metacommunities in landscapes.

"Peoples, BK; Goforth, RR",2017,The indirect role of species-level factors in biological invasions,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"AimBiological invasions are driven by factors related to species, locations and events. Species-level factors (namely functional traits) often distinguish successful invaders from other groups of species in trait-only analyses. However, traits are routinely found to be much less important than event-level (e.g. propagule pressure) or location-level (e.g. abiotic or congeneric effects) factors when included in the same model. We hypothesized that this rift exists largely because traits have (often overlooked) indirect effects that affect invasion success by influencing other mechanisms. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe developed a conceptual path diagram hypothesizing indirect effects on invasion success of species traits directly affecting (1) native range size, (2) propagule pressure, and (3) climate matching between native and non-native ranges. We used structural equation modelling to evaluate our hypothesis using open-access datasets on: (1) the naturalization success of non-native Pinus in New Zealand (McGregor et al., 2012, Diversity and Distributions, 18, 1013-1023), and (2) the global establishment success of non-native reptiles (Mahoney et al., 2015, Diversity and Distributions, 21, 64-74). Both these studies found little to no direct importance of traits on invasion success. ResultsOur analyses revealed indirect effects of species traits and native range size on invasion success. Traits indirectly affected Pinus naturalization success and reptile establishment success by affecting introduction effort and native range size. Consistent with the original analyses, traits had little measurable direct effect on invasion success.

Methods: We modelled two variables: (1) whether a species had become established outside its native range (establishment) and (2) the number of watersheds in which species established outside their native range (spread). We estimated these variables by comparing historical distributions to a rich data set of contemporary sampling. We calculated metrics of human use (indexing propagule pressure), and gathered species trait data from an open-access database. We then used piecewise path analysis to estimate direct and indirect effects of human use, native range size and species traits on the two metrics of species introductions. Results: We identified a hierarchical causal structure in which native range size and fishing pressure were important direct determinants of introductions. Species traits had some direct effects, but played a more indirect role. Native range size was significantly affected by thermal tolerance and diet breadth. Likewise, fishing pressure was significantly affected by life history strategy: larger-bodied, longer-living and more fecund species were positively associated with fishing pressure. Main conclusions: Functional traits can confer an advantage to some species during the establishment phase, but human use is important for subsequent dispersal throughout the non-native range. However, human use is non-random, and is largely a function of species traits.

The occurrence of complex networks of interactions among species not only relies on species co-occurrence, but also on inherited traits and evolutionary events imprinted in species phylogenies. The phylogenetic signal found in ecological networks suggests that evolution plays an important role in determining community assembly and hence could inform about the underpinning mechanisms. 2. The aim of this study was to review the main findings and methodological approaches used for detecting phylogenetic signal in species interaction networks, particularly in different aspects of network structure: conservatism of interactions, modularity, connectivity and nestedness. 3. In general, studies show that species phylogenies determine interacting partners, module composition, species roles and nested patterns, although these influences are not always consistent across different interaction types. The relative importance of phylogeny to network structure, as well as the scale dependence of phylogenetic signal, denotes key areas for future research. 4.

However, hybridization between ecomorphologically divergent taxa commonly occurs in nature and may lead to alternative evolutionary outcomes, such as genetic merger or gene flow at specific genes. We evaluate this hypothesis by studying patterns of divergence and gene flow across three replicate contact zones between high- and low-elevation ecomorphs of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) that have experienced altitudinal range shifts over the current postglacial period. Strong population structure with high genetic divergence in mitochondrial DNA suggests that vicariant evolution has occurred over several glacial-interglacial cycles and that it has led to cryptic differentiation within ecomorphs. In current parapatric boundaries, we do not find evidence for local extinction and replacement upon postglacial expansion. Instead, parapatric taxa recurrently show discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, suggesting nuclear-mediated gene flow across contact zones. Isolation with migration models support this hypothesis by showing significant gene flow across all five parapatric boundaries. Together, our results suggest that, while some genomic regions, such as the mitochondria, may follow morphologic species traits and retreat to isolated mountain tops, other genomic regions, such as nuclear markers, may flow across parapatric boundaries, sometimes leading to a complete genetic merger. We show that despite high ecologic and morphologic divergence over prolonged periods of time, hybridization allows for evolutionary outcomes alternative to extinction and replacement of taxa in response to climate change.",10.1111/mec.13575,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Direct gradient analysis allows the use of predictors such as environmental factors and spatial descriptors to directly estimate their contributions in explaining common and independent patterns of species distributions. In recent years, ecologists have started to explore how evolutionary history is associated with community patterns given the observation that species that share a common phylogenetic history tend also to have similar niches. Although ecological phylogenetics is among the fastest-growing fields in ecology, gradient analysis has not yet been fully integrated in this field. In this paper, we show and adapt the versatility of gradient analysis in describing and interpreting patterns of ecological communities based on their patterns of phylogenetic structure.

Two emerging fields, metacommunity ecology and community phylogenetics, have been making relevant, though rather independent, progress toward understanding how communities are assembled in space. Our main goals were twofold. First, we described a heuristical framework to merge these two fields into ""metacommunity phylogenetics.'' The main goal of this framework is to provide a way to think about how niche properties of species arranged across the environment and different spatial scales influence the process of community assembly.

Here we analyse how much variation in RSD is explained by hunting habitat structure, territoriality or territory size. We do so using data on diurnal raptors from the New World and the Western Palearctic - i.e. Cathartidae, Pandionidae, Accipitridae and Falconidae, the largest bird group showing RSD - taking into account the phylogenetic relationships among species. Our results identify the type of the main prey as a major factor explaining RSD in raptors. We also found RSD to increase with increasing structural complexity in the hunting habitat from open or semi-open habitats to forest interior. RSD also increased with increasing degree of territoriality of the species (non-territorial < facultative < territorial). Finally, for territorial species RSD increased with increasing size of nesting territory. A model comprising only three predictor variables (prey type, structural complexity of hunting habitat and territoriality) explained up to 50% of the variation in RSD of European and American diurnal raptor species, and up to 40% of the variation in RSD when only territorial species were considered. Our results highlight the relevance of spatial facets of the niche - e.g. hunting habitat, territoriality and territory size - in exerting selective pressures on the body size of diurnal raptors.

Understanding how different factors mediate the resistance of communities to climatic variability is a question of considerable ecological interest that remains mostly unresolved. This is particularly remarkable to improve predictions about the impact of climate change on vegetation.2. Here, we used a trait-based approach to analyse the sensitivity to climatic variability over 9 years of 19 Mediterranean shrubland communities located in southwest Spain. We evaluated the role of functional diversity (FD) and soil environment as drivers of community stability (assessed as changes in plant cover, species diversity and composition).3. The studied shrubland communities were strongly sensitive to inter-annual variability in climate. First, colder and drier conditions caused remarkable decreases in total plant cover but increased FD, likely because the reduction of plant cover after harsh climatic conditions promoted the expansion of functionally dissimilar species in the new open microsites; although communities returned to their initial values of plant cover after nine years, changes in FD and structure persisted over time. Second, drier and colder conditions favoured the predominance of shrubs with a conservative resource-use strategy (i.e. with higher dry matter content in leaves, stems and roots), bigger seeds and a more efficient use of water.4. The most functionally diverse communities were the most stable over time in terms of species diversity, likely because a higher number of functionally dissimilar species allowed compensatory dynamics among them.5. Communities inhabiting more acidic and resource-limited environments were less variable over time, probably because they were mainly constituted by slow-growth, stress-tolerant species that are potentially better adapted to harsh climatic conditions.6. Synthesis. This study highlights the utility of a trait-based approach to evaluate how plant communities respond to climatic variability. We could infer that the increased frequency of extreme climatic events predicted by climatic models will alter the functional structure of shrubland communities, with potential repercussions for ecosystem functioning.

The sign of these effects remains controversial because phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic identity may interactively influence EF. Positive relationships, traditionally attributed to complementarity effects, seem unimportant in natural soil bacterial communities. Negative relationships could be attributed to fitness differences leading to the overrepresentation of few productive clades, a mechanism recently invoked to assemble soil bacteria communities. We tested in two ecosystems contrasting in terms of environmental heterogeneity whether two metrics of phylogenetic community structure, a simpler measure of phylogenetic diversity (NRI) and a more complex metric incorporating taxonomic identity (PCPS), correctly predict microbially mediated EF. We show that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and EF depends on the taxonomic identity of the main coexisting lineages. Phylogenetic diversity was negatively related to EF in soils where a marked fertility gradient exists and a single and productive clade (Proteobacteria) outcompete other clades in the most fertile plots. However, phylogenetic diversity was unrelated to EF in soils where the fertility gradient is less marked and Proteobacteria coexist with other abundant lineages.

The science and practice of restoration ecology, in collaboration with other disciplines, can contribute to overcoming these challenges. This endeavor requires a solid conceptual foundation based in empirical research which confronts, tests and influences theoretical developments. We review conceptual developments in restoration ecology over the last 30 years. We frame our review in the context of changing restoration goals which reflect increased societal awareness of the scale of environmental degradation and the recognition that inter-disciplinary approaches are needed to tackle environmental problems. Restoration ecology now encompasses facilitative interactions and network dynamics, trophic cascades, and above- and below ground linkages. It operates in a non-equilibrium, alternative states framework, at the landscape scale, and in response to changing environmental, economic and social conditions. Progress has been marked by conceptual advances in the fields of trait-environment relationships, community assembly, and understanding the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Conceptual and practical advances have been enhanced by applying evolving technologies, including treatments to increase seed germination and overcome recruitment bottlenecks, high throughput DNA sequencing to elucidate soil community structure and function, and advances in satellite technology and GPS tracking to monitor habitat use. The synthesis of these technologies with systematic reviews of context dependencies in restoration success, model based analyses and consideration of complex socio-ecological systems will allow generalizations to inform evidence based interventions.

For this purpose, the trait-based approach has promoted the analysis of functional trait distributions within communities. Until now, much attention has been paid to the design of appropriate null models and the definition of relevant functional metrics for inferring community assembly mechanisms from trait distributions. However, less consideration were given to the set of methodological choices preceding the statistical analysis - i.e. from designing a sampling scheme to measuring traits - and how likely they influence the conclusions drawn, as this may subject the analysis to methodological biases. In this regard, a comprehensive perspective on how the overall set of methodological choices influence the inference of community assembly mechanisms is needed. We extensively reviewed recent studies that have addressed animal and plant community assembly by applying a trait-based null model approach. We analyzed how the set of methodological choices in these studies depended on the mechanisms of interest and how they could influence the conclusions drawn by the authors. We found that methodological choices only weakly depended on the hypothesized assembly mechanisms studied by the authors, especially because the two main assembly mechanisms hypothesized, i.e. environmental filtering and limiting similarity, were often tested based on a common experimental design. In contrast, the detection of assembly mechanisms was strongly dependent on the sampling scale, the type of data, the origin of trait values and the delineation of the reference species pool, while less affected by the null model and the functional metrics chosen. These results underline plausible methodological biases in favor of the detection of certain mechanisms to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the predominant mechanisms concluded by the authors and the type of organism used as biological model, suggesting either that the methodological choices depend on a common strategy used by the different authors when studying similar biological models, or that the methodological choices depended on certain particular properties of the organisms. From this extensive review, we highlight major conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in trait-based null model approaches. We synthesize the methodological choices relevant to study several assembly mechanisms while minimizing methodological biases. We then derive practical guidelines and emphasize the importance of spatial structure in sampling strategy and null model design, because of the scale-dependent signatures of ecological processes.

A test on species-rich shrublands, Western Australia",JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Questions A species' spatial pattern is the outcome of a series of filters: demographic, disturbance, environmental and functional, all varying over space and time. To evaluate the importance of function as a filter we ask: (1) do a species' functional traits allow prediction of its fine-scale spatial patterning, and (2) how consistent is the fine-scale spatial pattern shown by the same species across multiple sites where the properties of the other filters may vary? Location Species-rich Mediterranean climate shrublands of southwestern Australia's northern sandplains. Methods Using fully mapped plots at four sites (each >10000 individuals, 74112 species), we characterized individual species spatial patterning using point pattern analyses. We classified species spatial patterns in three ways: (1) whether they departed from a null model controlling for first-order effects (i.e. are they aggregated?), (2) parameterization of Thomas cluster processes (what form does any clustering take?), and (3) their position in a multivariate pattern space' (do species show different types of pattern?). We then explored the extent to which a species' functional traits, abundance and/or the site at which it occurred predicted these three facets of its spatial pattern. Results Although at all sites most species were aggregated, site was consistently important in predicting a species' spatial pattern. Regenerative response to fire whether a species is killed by fire and recruits solely via seeds, or survives and resprouts vegetatively after fire was the functional trait most consistently useful in predicting a species' spatial pattern. Fire-killed species tended to show more aggregated distributions than resprouters. Species present at multiple sites did not show consistency in their spatial patterns across those sites more than expected by chance alone. Conclusions Although functional traits relating to fire responses and water use predict species spatial distributions at the landscape level, at the fine scales we considered site effects were as important as functional traits in explaining spatial pattern. Within and between site heterogeneity, some of which can be generated by the stochastic properties of fire, may mask the deterministic effects of species functional traits.",10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01476.x,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Shrublands,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = regenerative response to fire, life form, mode of seed storage, seed size, dispersal mode",
"Persson, L; De Roos, AM",2003,Adaptive habitat use in size-structured populations: Linking individual behavior to population processes,ECOLOGY,"The inclusion of flexible behavior in population models can be viewed as part of the development of a mechanistic population/community framework based on individual-level concepts. Based on short-term experiments and analyses of the dynamics of nonstructured models, trait-mediated indirect effects resulting from flexible behavior have been suggested to have major effects on population and community dynamics. We use physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) to account for and assess the importance of flexible behavior in population models where individuals differ substantially in size. We investigate a consumer-resource system in which a size-structured consumer feeds on two resources that are present in two habitats differing in predation risk (pelagic open water vs. littoral vegetation). We compare two flexible rules that individuals might use to trade off foraging gains and size-dependent mortality risks in the two habitats. One rule maximizes the ratio of growth over mortality, and the other optimizes the expected instantaneous biomass increase. As a result of strong population feedback, the dynamics and habitat use are qualitatively the same for both rules when open-water mortalities are low, and indeed differ little from a case in which individuals use the two habitats in a fixed proportion. At higher open-water mortalities, the consumers using the two flexible rules show high-amplitude population cycles, whereas consumers using a fixed rule cannot persist. Overall, our results suggest that the behavioral rule used by individuals may be of minor importance, whereas the population feedback is of major importance. In nonstructured models, increased persistence induced by flexible behavior co-occurs with destabilization, as we find here, but the mechanisms behind this pattern are different, driven by cohort cycles rather than by the paradox of enrichment. We argue that extrapolating from experimental data which describe short-term experiments may overemphasize or misrepresent the long-term, population-level effects of flexible behavior. The inclusion of behavior as a proper individual state in physiologically structured population models remains a fundamental issue to solve.",10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1129:AHUISP]2.0.CO;2,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Marine,Broad,Broad,1,1,1,1,1,Multiple,4,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = feeding rate, metabolic rate, growth rate, mortality rate, habitat",

Here, we study the effects of the pesticide imidacloprid on the responses of Daphnia magna to a combination of predator-release kairomones from trout and alarm cues from conspecifics, simulating different levels of perceived predation risk. The joint effects of simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed both by traditional analysis of variance and by employing conceptual models for the evaluation of contaminant mixture exposures. Results demonstrated that pesticide exposure can significantly increase the costs of inducible antipredator defences and impair life-history responses of daphnids to fish predation pressure. Since trait-mediated effects are well-known to play a key role in population dynamics, the combined direct and indirect effects of sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides could induce maladaptive responses in zooplankton populations in the field, reducing their longterm viability.

Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction.

"Petchey, OL; Gaston, KJ",2006,Functional diversity: back to basics and looking forward,ECOLOGY LETTERS,"Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00924.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

It has been, however, much less appreciated that the context of modelling and simulations in ecology is essentially different from those that normally exist in other natural sciences. In our paper, we review the computational challenges arising in modern ecology in the spirit of computational mathematics, i.e. with our main focus on the choice and use of adequate numerical methods. Somewhat paradoxically, the complexity of ecological problems does not always require the use of complex computational methods. This paradox, however, can be easily resolved if we recall that application of sophisticated computational methods usually requires clear and unambiguous mathematical problem statement as well as clearly defined benchmark information for model validation. At the same time, many ecological problems still do not have mathematically accurate and unambiguous description, and available field data are often very noisy, and hence it can be hard to understand how the results of computations should be interpreted from the ecological viewpoint. In this scientific context, computational ecology has to deal with a new paradigm: conventional issues of numerical modelling such as convergence and stability become less important than the qualitative analysis that can be provided with the help of computational techniques. We discuss this paradigm by considering computational challenges arising in several specific ecological applications.",10.1098/rsfs.2011.0083,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Pey, B.; Cortet, J.; Watteau, F.; Cheynier, K.; Schwartz, C.",2013,Structure of earthworm burrows related to organic matter of a constructed Technosol,GEODERMA,"Literature considering earthworms as a biological agent of Technosol functioning, especially those constructed in order to reclaim degraded areas (e.g. industrial wasteland), is scarce. The main objectives of the following work is: (i) to describe the structure of burrows produced by two different eco-morphological groups of earthworms in a constructed Technosol and (ii) to link their burrowing activity to Technosol organic matter transfers and carbon content in one-species and two-species combinations. For these purposes, the contributions of Lumbricus terrestris as an epi-anecic earthworm and Aporrectodea caliginosa as an endogeic one to such functioning aspects of a constructed Technosol, resulting from soil engineering processes (e.g. choice of proportions, parent materials) were assessed using laboratory microcosm experiments. The Technosol studied was composed of green waste compost, treated industrial soil and paper mill sludge. Earthworms were inoculated separately and together in the constructed Technosol over a period of 75 days. Ultra-structural analysis of randomly selected burrows of the one-species treatments and the soil of the control treatment were sampled to describe their structure. Functional consequences on the organic matter in the Technosol were assessed by studying remaining surface litter mass, transfer of surface organic matter to depth and by measuring soil carbon content. At the ultrastructural scale, the burrowing activity of the two eco-morphological groups of earthworms locally modified the organo-mineral associations of the Technosol. Burrows presented a similar structure for both species, with a looser internal cutan including some organic elements and microbial activity tracks (closed to the lumen) and a compacted external mineral cutan (distant from the lumen). However, structural differences were observed between species. L terrestris burrows contained a visible organo-mineral interface, resulting from the interface between the internal cutan, which was much more organic than for the A. caliginosa one, and the external mineral cutan. For L terrestris, mucus was present as a large stratum visible between the interface and the external mineral cutan, whereas the mucus was scattered for A. caliginosa. Aggregation also differed between species. Even though both burrows presented some organo-mineral aggregates, plant organic matter particularly contributed to the aggregates for L. terrestris, whereas aggregation was essentially bacterial for A. caliginosa. As is the case for ""natural soils"", these results confirmed the notions of i) ""ecosystem engineers"" in constructed Technosols, by demonstrating that earthworms create organo-mineral structures with a similar structure and ii) eco-morphological groups by distinguishing differences between these structures. At a larger scale (microcosm scale), L terrestris buried significantly more surface organic matter into depth than A. caliginosa. However, almost no effect of either of the two earthworms (one-species and two-species treatments) on soil carbon content was noticeable. It is suggested that not enough soil carbon measures were made given the temporal and spatial scales of this experiment or earthworm effects may have been masked in the man-made soil built with materials with high initial carbon content. Although sometimes slight at the microcosm scale, differences suggested that earthworm combinations of dissimilar eco-morphological groups led to different effects on organic transfers and carbon content of the constructed Technosol.Developing knowledge about effects of soil fauna diversity in constructed Technosols using reliable tools (e.g. trait-based approaches) is required. It would better predict the effects of biological agents such as earthworms in soil engineering and in turn improve the ecological restoration of such Technosols. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we present an agent-based model (ABM) to predict the growth and distribution of young-of-the-year (YOY) and one-year-old (1+) Atlantic salmon and brown trout in response to flow change during summer. A field study of a real population during both natural and low flow conditions provided the simulation environment and validation patterns. Virtual fish were realistic both in terms of bioenergetics and feeding. We tested alternative movement rules to replicate observed patterns of body mass, growth rates, stretch distribution and patch occupancy patterns. Notably, there was no calibration of the model. Virtual fish prioritising consumption rates before predator avoidance replicated observed growth and distribution patterns better than a purely maximising consumption rule. Stream conditions of low predation and harsh winters provide ecological justification for the selection of this behaviour during summer months. Overall, the model was able to predict distribution and growth patterns well across both natural and low flow regimes.

Biological invasions are a major consequence of globalization and pose a significant threat to biodiversity. Because only a small fraction of introduced species become invasive, identification of those species most likely to become invasive after introduction is highly desirable to focus management efforts. The predictive potential of species-specific traits has been much investigated in plants and animals. However, despite the importance of fungi as a biological group and the potentially severe effects of pathogenic fungi on agrosystems and natural ecosystems, the specific identification of traits correlated with the invasion success of fungi has not been attempted previously. 2. We addressed this question by constructing an ad hoc data set including invasive and non-invasive species of forest pathogenic fungi introduced into Europe. Data were analysed with a machine learning method based on classification trees (Random Forest). The performance of the classification rule based on species traits was compared with that of several random decision rules, and the principal trait predictors associated with invasive species were identified. 3. Invasion success was more accurately predicted by the classification rule including biological traits than by random decision rules. The effect of species traits was maintained when confounding variables linked to residence time and habitat availability were included. The selected traits were unlikely to be affected by a phylogenetic bias as invasive and non-invasive species were evenly distributed in fungal clades. 4. The species-level predictors identified as useful for distinguishing between invasive and non-invasive species were traits related to long-distance dispersal, sexual reproduction (in addition to asexual reproduction), spore shape and size, number of cells in spores, optimal temperature for growth and parasitic specialization (host range and infected organs). 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that some species-level traits are predictors of invasion success for forest pathogenic fungi in Europe. These traits could be used to refine current pest risk assessment (PRA) schemes. Our results suggest that current schemes, which are mostly based on sequential questionnaires, could be improved by taking into account trait interactions or combinations.

Many statistical techniques have been defined to classify species into groups, and a question is whether different techniques bring consistent classifications. In a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, five species classifications have been defined by different authors for the purpose of forest growth modelling but using different data sets and different statistical techniques. The correspondence between the five classifications was measured using four indices that are generalizations of existing indices to compare two classifications. A multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify associations between groups of different classifications. In a second step, two-table multivariate analyses were used to characterize the relationships between species classifications and eight species traits (consisting of seven populational traits and one functional trait). We evidenced a consensus on the potential size of trees: species were similarly clustered by the five classifications along this trait that is correlated to turnover rate. More surprisingly, no consensus was found for growth rate, nor wood density, traits that are correlated with light requirement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we use a novel phylogenetic approach to test whether biotic interactions constrain the transition to secondary sympatry following speciation. Applying this temporal framework to a diverse clade of passerine birds (Furnariidae), we reject models of geographic range overlap limited purely by dispersal or environmental constraints, and instead show that rates of secondary sympatry are positively associated with both the phylogenetic and morphological distance between species. Thus, transition rates to sympatry increase with time since divergence and accelerate as the ecological differences between species accumulate. Taken together, these results provide strong empirical evidence that biotic interactions and primarily ecological competition limit species distributions across large spatial and temporal scales.

Identifying the factors that determine the success of biological invasions has major consequences for both ecological theory and conservation decision-making. Reliably inferring these factors depends on adequately accounting for the known effects of propagule pressure on establishment success, but detailed information on the size and number of introduced populations is often lacking.2. Here, we conduct simulations to explore the effects of incomplete knowledge of propagule pressure on inferences regarding the correlates of establishment success. We compare situations where we have complete information on propagule number and propagule size across species, allowing success to be modelled at the population scale (population-level analysis), with those where data for propagule size (species-level analysis) and both propagule size and number (location-level analysis) are unavailable. We assess the ability to correctly infer the effects of a covariate on establishment success when this covariate exhibits varying degrees of correlation with propagule pressure.3. We show that when establishment success is modelled at the level of species, rather than populations, this leads to an elevated tendency to incorrectly infer the effects of species-level traits on establishment success (higher type 1 error and lower power), particularly when traits in question are strongly associated with propagule pressure. These biases are magnified when using proxies for propagule pressure, such as the number of locations where species have been introduced, and are magnified further when these proxies are converted to binary variables.4. Our results validate the current best practice for the analysis of establishment success in alien species at the population level, when the effects of propagule size and a covariate predicting establishment probability can both be reliably inferred. However, given the growing interest in understanding correlates of biological invasions, they strongly urge caution in interpreting results based on incomplete knowledge of propagule pressure.",10.1111/2041-210X.12930,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,1,"gives the ability to incorporate a trait, but doesn't actually use a real one, just a value in place",

We define phylogenetic structure of a community as phylogenetically weighted species composition. This is used to reveal patterns of phylogenetic community variation and to measure and test by specified null models the phylogenetic signal at the metacommunity level, which we distinguish from phylogenetic signal at the species pool level. The former indicates that communities more similar in their phylogenetic structure are also similar in their average trait values, which may indicate species' niche conservation for the given traits.

The study was carried out in the Tagus estuary (western Portugal). Samples of macrobenthic communities and associated environmental variables were taken in four surveys (September 2012, and February, May and October 2013) across the contamination gradient from three main zones: a slightly contaminated, a moderately contaminated and a highly contaminated zone. Functional traits for the most abundant species were assigned using seven categories based on ""Feeding mode"", ""Life span"", ""Body size"", ""Motility"", ""Position in sediments"", ""Larval type"" and ""AMBI ecological group"". To investigate whether the macroinvertebrate community structure was associated with the environmental parameters and biological traits an integrative multivariate analysis, combining the RLQ analysis and the fourth-corner method, was applied. Within this analysis, human-induced estuarine variables (metals) were rendered independent from natural ones (sediment fine particles) through partial correlations. Following this approach, it was possible to decouple the effects of two typically highly correlated environmental descriptors with different origins. Overall, the study identified significant relationships between sediment environmental descriptors and the functional traits of macrobenthic communities. Further, RLQ/Fourth-corner combined analysis successfully isolated the traits and corresponding species that were most correlated with the measured concentration of trace metals in sediments, supporting the knowledge that benthic organisms exhibit distinct responses to different levels of disturbance. A shift in species dominance occurred along the contamination gradient with epifaunal tolerant species with very small size, long life span, and crawling motility dominating the highest contaminated area. This area was also related with surface deposit-feeder species. The most representative species associated with this area was the gastropod Peringia ulvae. Less contaminated sites revealed large-sized specimens, carnivores and swimmers, mainly represented by the polychaete Nephtys hombergii. This finding is consistent with other studies addressing different kinds of disturbance, where a shift in dominance from carnivore/predators, long-lived and large animals to the predominance of small-size, short-lived and deposit-feeders has been observed across increasing gradients of disturbance. Our results reinforce the importance of macrobenthic functional traits analysis to assess human disturbances driven impacts in multi-stressed estuarine ecosystems. By analysing the environmental variables with different origins independently, we were able to draw conclusions about the effects of human pressures (metals) on macrobenthic traits. Such distinction can be particularly useful to isolate different environmental descriptors and assess their effects on functional diversity, making the current approach promising in evaluation the ecological effects of anthropogenic stressors in estuarine areas.

"Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel; Hodgson, David J.; Tregenza, Tom",2008,The evolution of body size under environmental gradients in ectotherms: why should Bergmann's rule apply to lizards?,BMC Evolutionary Biology,"Background: The impact of environmental gradients on the evolution of life history traits is a central issue in macroecology and evolutionary biology. A number of hypotheses have been formulated to explain factors shaping patterns of variation in animal mass. One such example is Bergmann's rule, which predicts that body size will be positively correlated with latitude and elevation, and hence, with decreasing environmental temperatures. A generally accepted explanation for this phenotypic response is that as body mass increases, body surface area gets proportionally smaller, which contributes to reduced rates of heat-loss. Phylogenetic and non- phylogenetic evidence reveals that endotherms follow Bergmann's rule. In contrast, while previous non-phylogenetic studies supported this prediction in up to 75% of ectotherms, recent phylogenetic comparative analyses suggest that its validity for these organisms is controversial and less understood. Moreover, little attention has been paid to why some ectotherms conform to this rule, while others do not. Here, we investigate Bergmann's rule in the six main clades forming the Liolaemus genus, one of the largest and most environmentally diverse genera of terrestrial vertebrates. A recent study conducted on some species belonging to four of these six clades concluded that Liolaemus species follow Bergmann's rule, representing the only known phylogenetic support for this model in lizards. However, a later reassessment of this evidence, performed on one of the four analysed clades, produced contrasting conclusions. Results: Our results fail to support Bergmann's rule in Liolaemus lizards. Non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that none of the studied clades experience increasing body size with increasing latitude and elevation. Conclusion: Most physiological and behavioural processes in ectotherms depend directly upon their body temperature. In cold environments, adaptations to gain heat rapidly are under strong positive selection to allow optimal feeding, mating and predator avoidance. Therefore, evolution of larger body size in colder environments appears to be a disadvantageous thermoregulatory strategy. The repeated lack of support for Bergmann's rule in ectotherms suggests that this model should be recognized as a valid rule exclusively for endotherms.",10.1186/1471-2148-8-68,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Herps,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = body size,

Which functional traits best distinguish the weed communities of more and less extensively managed fields? Can the same traits predict the rarity of individual weed species? Location: Hungary. Methods: Using releve data from 60 cereal and 70 stubble fields, together with weed trait data, we characterized community responses to arable intensification using functional trait analyses based on trait-convergence and trait-divergence assembly patterns. We also examined how well the broad-scale rarity status of species predicts their occurrence along intensification gradients, and how it maps onto our functional classifications describing intensification responses. Results: The response of weeds to intensification in cereal fields was best described by a functional classification based on species' flowering duration, maximum height and seed weight: weeds of extensively managed fields have short flowering seasons (2-5 mo) and particularly large or small seeds. The highest proportions of rare species also happen to be found in these groups. The rarest weeds among these species tend to be late-winter and early-summer annuals, while the rare species of stubble fields tend to be broad-leaved with low nitrogen requirements, small seeds and short height. Stubble fields showed a decline in weed cover with increasing application of fertilizer and distance from the field edge, but we could detect no strong associations of management factors with trait composition, perhaps because the intensification gradient across these fields was shorter. Conclusions: Many rare Hungarian weeds are associated with traditional extensive farming practices. They are particularly characterized by short, midsummer flowering periods and by preference for low nitrogen levels, but a range of trait syndromes must be considered to understand their ecology and conservation.

"Pisanty, Gideon; Mandelik, Yael",2015,Profiling crop pollinators: life history traits predict habitat use and crop visitation by Mediterranean wild bees,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Wild pollinators, bees in particular, may greatly contribute to crop pollination and provide a safety net against declines in commercial pollinators. However, the identity, life history traits, and environmental sensitivities of main crop pollinator species have received limited attention. These are crucial for predicting pollination services of different communities and for developing management practices that enhance crop pollinators. We sampled wild bees in three crop systems (almond, confection sunflower, and seed watermelon) in a mosaic Israeli Mediterranean landscape. Bees were sampled in field/orchard edges and interiors, and in seminatural scrub surrounding the fields/orchards. We also analyzed land cover at 50-2500 m radii around fields/orchards. We used this data to distinguish crop from non-crop pollinators based on a set of life history traits (nesting, lecty, sociality, body size) linked to habitat preference and crop visitation. Bee abundance and species richness decreased from the surrounding seminatural habitat to the field/orchard interior, especially across the seminatural habitat-field edge ecotone. Thus, although rich bee communities were found near fields, only small fractions crossed the ecotone and visited crop flowers in substantial numbers. The bee assemblage in agricultural fields/orchards and on crop flowers was dominated by ground-nesting bees of the tribe Halictini, which tend to nest within fields. Bees' habitat preferences were determined mainly by nesting guild, whereas crop visitation was determined mainly by sociality. Lecty and body size also affected both measures. The percentage of surrounding seminatural habitat at 250-2500 m radii had a positive effect on wild bee diversity in field edges, for all bee guilds, while at 50-100 m radii, only aboveground nesters were positively affected. In sum, we found that crop and non-crop pollinators are distinguished by behavioral and morphological traits. Hence, analysis of life-history traits of bee communities can help assess the pollination services they are likely to provide (when taking into account single-visit pollination efficiency). The ecotone between agricultural fields and surrounding habitats is a major barrier that filters many bee species, particularly with regard to their nesting requirements. Thus, greater attention should be given to management practices that encourage pollinators to live and nest, and not only forage, within fields.",10.1890/14-0910.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = nesting type, lecty, sociality, body size",

In contrast, the evolution of female mate choice in species exhibiting resource-free mating systems remains controversial. One such species in which males contribute nothing but sperm during mating is the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Here, we examined whether female guppies can obtain information on male fertility (i.e., direct fertility benefits) via cues used during mate choice. Specifically, we examined whether male guppy colour patterns, body size, and mating behaviour signal their functional fertility, that is, their ability to supply a large number of sperm at copulation. We found significant correlations between male phenotype parameters and the number of sperm in male guppies originating from two wild Trinidadian populations. There were, however, significant interpopulation differences with respect to which traits were good predictors of sperm load. In the low-predation Paria River population, larger males and males with relatively more carotenoid colouration had significantly larger sperm loads, but mating behaviour (i.e., sigmoids) and melanin colouration were not good predictors of sperm load. In the high-predation Tacarigua River population, larger males, males that displayed more, and males with less yellow colouration had significantly more sperm, but other colour pattern components (area of orange and black colouration) were not good predictors of sperm load. Overall, our results suggest that there is the potential for direct fertility benefits through mate choice in the promiscuous, non-resource-based mating system of the guppy.",10.1139/cjz-79-10-1891,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Pizzolotto, R; Albertini, A; Gobbi, M; Brandmayr, P",2016,Habitat diversity analysis along an altitudinal sequence of alpine habitats: the Carabid beetle assemblages as a study model,PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM,"Background and purpose. Species traits have been extensively used by botanists to describe, group and rank species according to their functions. Recently, the multi-trait approach has been extended also to the animal assemblages. There is now growing evidence that interspecific traits-variability can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. The aim of our study was to describe how the carabid species traits change in relation to an altitudinal sequence of habitat types. Materials and methods. In this paper we weighted the species traits (dispersal power, diet, reproductive rhythm, chorology) of the Carabid beetles assemblages in nineteen sites in the Dolomites along an altitudinal sequence of habitat types (1000-2250 ma.s.l.). Carabids have been sampled by means of pitfall traps. Results. Species richness, activity density and species traits were not, or weakly, correlated with elevation, while they showed to be linked to the habitat type. Species traits, as taxa, showed to be not uniformly distributed along the sequence, with brachypterous species concentrated in high-altitude or climax environments mainly, and regional endemic species prevailing in high-altitude environments. Macropterous species with zoospermophagous species were found to increase with anthropogenic environmental disturbance. Conclusions. The species traits analysis enabled us to shift the research focus from the taxonomic level to a biological more comprehensive level, opening the way for drawing more general ecologic models. Moreover it was possible to make inferences about the most successful carabid strategies in order to advance hypotheses on the historical colonization processes in the Alps.",10.18054/pb.2016.118.3.3924,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Alpine,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = dispersal power, diet, reproductive rhythm, chorology",

In addition, conserved transcriptional circuitries involved in developing sexual organs in fungi are not characterized, despite the growing number of gene expression datasets available from reproductive and vegetative tissue. The aims of this study were: first, to evaluate the tissue specificity of defense gene expression in the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea and, second, to assess the degree of conservation in transcriptional regulation during sexual development in basidiomycetes.Results: In order to characterize the regulation in the expression of defense loci and the transcriptional circuitries controlling sexual reproduction in basidiomycetes, we sequenced the poly (A)-positive transcriptome of stage 1 primordia and vegetative mycelium of C. cinerea A43mutB43mut. Our data show that many genes encoding predicted and already characterized defense proteins are differentially expressed in these tissues. The predicted specificity of these proteins with regard to target organisms suggests that their expression pattern correlates with the type of antagonists these tissues are confronted with. Accordingly, we show that the stage 1 primordium-specific protein CC1G_11805 is toxic to insects and nematodes. Comparison of our data to analogous data from Laccaria bicolor and Schizophyllum commune revealed that the transcriptional regulation of nearly 70 loci is conserved and probably subjected to stabilizing selection. A Velvet domain-containing protein was found to be up-regulated in all three fungi, providing preliminary evidence of a possible role of the Velvet protein family in sexual development of basidiomycetes. The PBS-soluble proteome of C. cinerea primordia and mycelium was analyzed by shotgun LC-MS. This proteome data confirmed the presence of intracellular defense proteins in primordia.Conclusions: This study shows that the exposure of different tissues in fungi to different types of antagonists shapes the expression pattern of defense loci in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, we identify a transcriptional circuitry conserved among basidiomycetes during fruiting body formation that involves, amongst other transcription factors, the up-regulation of a Velvet domain-containing protein.",10.1186/1471-2164-15-492,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"POFF, NL; ALLAN, JD",1995,FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION OF STREAM FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN RELATION TO HYDROLOGICAL VARIABILITY,ECOLOGY,"Stream fish assemblage data for 34 sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota were obtained from archived sources and were used in conjunction with long-term hydrological data to test the hypothesis that functional organization of Ash communities is related to hydrological variability. For each of the 106 species present in the data set, six categories of species traits were derived to describe habitat, trophic, morphological, and tolerance characteristics. A hierarchical clustering routine was used to identify two functionally similar groups of assemblages defined in terms of species presence/absence, Hydrological factors describing streamflow variability and predictability, as well as frequency and predictability of high flow and low flow extremes, were derived for each of the 34 sites and employed to explain differences among the functionally defined groups. Canonical discriminant analysis revealed that the hydrological data could clearly separate the two ecologically defined groups of assemblages, which were associated with either hydrologically variable streams (high coefficient of variation of daily flows, moderate frequency of spates) or hydrologically stable streams (high predictability of daily flows, stable baseflow conditions). Discriminant functions based on hydrological information classified the 34 fish assemblages into the correct ecological group with 85% accuracy. Assemblages from hydrologically variable sites had generalized feeding strategies, were associated with silt and general substrata, were characterized by slow-velocity species with headwater affinities, and were tolerant to silt. Proportions of species traits present at the 34 sites were regressed against an index of hydrological stability derived from a principal components analysis to test the hypothesis that functional organization of assemblages varied across a gradient of hydrological stability. Results were complementary with the discriminant analysis. Findings were in general agreement with theoretical predictions that variable habitats should support resource generalists while stable habitats should be characterized by a higher proportion of specialist species. Several species of fish were identified as indicative of the variable-stable hydrological gradient among stream sites, A taxonomic analysis showed strong geographic patterns in species composition of the 34 assemblages. However, zoogeographic constraints did not explain the observed relationship between stream hydrology and functional organization of fish assemblages, The strong hydrological-assemblage relations found in the 34 midwestern sites suggest that hydrological factors are significant environmental variables influencing fish assemblage structure, and that hydrological alterations induced by climate change (or other anthropogenic disturbances) could modify stream fish assemblage structure in this region.",10.2307/1941217,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = trophic guild, tolerance to silt, habitat casification, shape factor, swimming factor",

This approach holds much potential for predicting changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We created a new database on species-trait composition of North American lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4 broad categories: life-history morphological, mobility, and ecological. First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple environmental gradients.",10.1899/0887-3593(2006)025[0730:FTNONA]2.0.CO;2,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,1,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,1,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = voltinism, development, syncronization of emergence, adult life span, adult ability to exit, ability to survive desciation, female dispersal, adult flying strength, occurrence in drift, max crawling rate, swimming ability, attachment, armoring, shape, respiration, size at maturity, rheophily, thermal preference, habitat, trophic habit",
"Poisot, T; Stouffer, DB; Gravel, D",2015,Beyond species: why ecological interaction networks vary through space and time,OIKOS,"Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales. Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these factors. We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions.",10.1111/oik.01719,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Pollard, KA; Blumstein, DT",2008,Time allocation and the evolution of group size,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Group size is a core trait de. ning social systems, social complexity and social structure, so understanding group-size evolution is critical to understanding the evolution of sociality. Traditional views of group-size evolution focus on ecological factors such as predation risk and physical resources, but the additional factor of time has remained largely unexplored. Time is a valuable limited resource for all animals, and its partitioning both is influenced by sociality and may constrain sociality. Time allocation may in fact be an important mechanism through which predation risk, resource needs and other factors influence the evolution of group size. Classic group-size and time-use hypotheses make no consistent evolutionary predictions, so comparative analyses are necessary to determine which of the predicted processes are active on broad evolutionary scales. To evaluate these predictions, we conducted a comparative study using 50 species of diurnal primates as a model taxon for cohesive group-living animals. The evolution of group size was correlated with time spent resting, even after controlling for life-history variables such as body mass and diet type. We suggest that constraints on time allocation should be better integrated into models of the causes and consequences of sociality and that these constraints may have implications for conservation.

"Polly, PD; Fuentes-Gonzalez, J; Lawing, AM; Bormet, AK; Dundas, RG",2017,Clade sorting has a greater effect than local adaptation on ecometric patterns in Carnivora,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,"Background: Ecometric patterning is the sorting of mean values of functional traits in communities in space through time at continental scales. Ecometric patterns can emerge from intraspecific population-level processes (selection along an environmental gradient), species-level processes (geographic sorting of species based on functional trait differences), or clade-level processes (geographic sorting based on phylogenetically shared traits). We analysed a hind limb ratio related to locomotion in carnivores (Mammalia, Carnivora) to determine (1) whether its ecometric patterning involves intraspecific population-level evolutionary processes; (2) whether ecometric patterning is produced by clade sorting processes; and (3) how ecometric patterns are altered by species turnover during glacial-interglacial cycles. Data: We analysed (1) intraspecific variation in hind limb ratio in five species to evaluate the importance of population-level processes in ecometric patterning; (2) the distributions of ratios within and among communities to evaluate the importance of clade sorting; and (3) the distributions of ratios of seven glacial fossil assemblages to evaluate temporal dynamics in ecometric patterns. We also analysed three-dimensional calcaneum shape to assess the strength of phylogenetic and functional components of hind limb variation. Analytical methods: Geometric morphometrics, phylogenetic comparative methods, and phylogenetic community assembly methods were used to evaluate trait-based clade sorting; RLQ analysis was used to measure the correlation between vegetation openness, spatial scale, species occurrences, phylogeny, and hind limb traits; and trait space was used to analyse turnover between glacial and extant carnivore communities. Results: Population-level selection is either too weak or ineffective to produce hind limb trait gradients within carnivore species; however, clade-level trait-based sorting has a strong impact on community-level trait distributions. RLQ analysis demonstrates that clade membership interacts with hind limb ratios and vegetation openness in carnivore community assembly.

The most common species were Dosidicus gigas, Benthosema panamense and Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis. Mean (+/- SD) muscle isotope values of the pelagic thresher shark were -16.0 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand for C-13 and 13.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand for N-15; mean (+/- SD) vertebrae values were -16.7 +/- 2.0 for C-13 and 9.4 +/- 1.8 for N-15.

Inter-individual variation in N-15 values was observed in both tissues and was likely related to foraging in different ecosystems with distinct isotope values.

Conclusions: Phylogenetic clustering, dictated by the relative rate between eco-evolutionary processes such as colonization, invasion, and local radiation, are more likely if both intra- and inter-habitat heterogeneity is high.

One popular method of measuring functional diversity is the dendrogram-based method, FD. To calculate FD, a variety of methodological choices are required, and it has been debated about whether biological conclusions are sensitive to such choices. We studied the probability that conclusions regarding FD were sensitive, and that patterns in sensitivity were related to alpha and beta components of species richness. We developed a randomization procedure that iteratively calculated FD by assigning species into two assemblages and calculating the probability that the community with higher FD varied across methods. We found evidence of sensitivity in all five communities we examined, ranging from a probability of sensitivity of 0 (no sensitivity) to 0.976 (almost completely sensitive). Variations in these probabilities were driven by differences in alpha diversity between assemblages and not by beta diversity. Importantly, FD was most sensitive when it was most useful (i.e., when differences in alpha diversity were low).

The Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike and Rainbow vent fields are located on the Azores triple junction of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These fields have distinct depths (from 850 to 2320 m) and geological contexts (basaltic and ultramafic), but share similar faunal assemblages defined by the presence of foundation species that include Bathymodiolus azoricus, alvino-carid shrimp and gastropods. We compared the food webs of 13 faunal assemblages at these three sites using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses (SIA). Results showed that photosynthesis-derived organic matter is a negligible basal source for vent food webs, at all depths. The contribution of methanotrophy versus autotrophy based on Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) or reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycles varied between and within vent fields according to the concentrations of reduced compounds (e.g. CH4, H2S). Species that were common to vent fields showed high trophic flexibility, suggesting weak trophic links to the metabolism of chemosynthetic primary producers. At the community level, a comparison of SIA-derived metrics between mussel assemblages from two vent fields (Menez Gwen & Lucky Strike) showed that the functional structure of food webs was highly similar in terms of basal niche diversification, functional specialization and redundancy. Coupling SIA to functional trait approaches included more variability within the analyses, but the functional structures were still highly comparable. These results suggest that despite variable environmental conditions (physico-chemical factors and basal sources) and faunal community structure, functional complexity remained relatively constant among mussel assemblages. This functional similarity may be favoured by the propensity of species to adapt to fluid variations and practise trophic flexibility. Furthermore, the different pools of species at vent fields may play similar functions in the community such as the change in composition does not affect the overall functional structure. Finally, the absence of a relationship between the functional structure and taxonomic diversity as well as the high overlap between species' isotopic niches within communities indicates that co-occuring species may have redundant functions. Therefore, the addition of species within in a functional group does not necessarily lead to more complexity.

Assessments that prioritize and classify tree species for management and conservation activities in the face of climate change will need to incorporate estimates of the risk posed by climate change to each species. To assist in such assessments, we developed a set of four quantitative metrics of potential climate change pressure on forest tree species: (1) percent change in suitable area, (2) range stability over time, (3) range shift pressure, and (4) current realized niche occupancy. All four metrics are derived from climate change environmental suitability maps generated using the Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MSTC) technique, which combines aspects of traditional geographical information systems and statistical clustering techniques. As part of the Forecasts of Climate-Associated Shifts in Tree Species (ForeCASTS) project, we calculated the predicted climate change pressure statistics for North American tree species using occurrence data from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Of 172 modeled tree species, all but two were projected to decline in suitable area in the future under the Hadley B1 Global Circulation Model/scenario combination. Eastern species under Hadley B1 were predicted to experience a greater decline in suitable area and less range stability than western species, although predicted range shift did not differ between the regions. Eastern species were more likely than western species, on average, to be habitat generalists.

Effective restoration of ecosystem structure and function needs to be built on a strong conceptual basis. The evaluation of restoration is critical in this respect, as it requires an accurate understanding of vegetation dynamics. This study was, therefore, designed to analyse how initial restoration treatments and spontaneous ecological processes act together to produce spatial heterogeneity of plant species at various scales, taking into account that species might respond differentially to these processes in accordance with their biological attributes. 2. In a model system consisting of a large land settlement located on the banks of the river Rhone (France), 85 geo-referenced plots were located, and the abundance of all plant species and seven biotic and abiotic environmental factors that have been modified by restoration were recorded. All species were classified into emergent groups (EGs) based on 12 plant traits, and the abundance of each EG was derived for each plot. Spatial variables that explained the spatial autocorrelation of the EGs at four scales were computed. This was performed using a spatial eigenvector mapping technique. The spatial variables were then linked to a range of selected environmental factors. 3. Large-scale patterning of EGs was explained mainly by the spatial heterogeneity of soil quality and vegetation cover. The attribute combination of the EGs that varied most at this scale suggested that the restoration had influenced vegetation development by inducing harsh physical conditions in some part of the studied area and biotic filtering (through competition) in others. 4. A large amount of the spatial variation of EGs was not explained by the environmental factors providing some evidence for pure spatial autocorrelation effects. At the finest scale, this was linked to poor dispersal abilities of some EGs. 5.Synthesis and applications. By combining a trait-based approach with spatially explicit methods, we explained and quantified the role of environmental changes induced by restoration and spontaneous biotic processes in structuring plant communities on different spatial scales within a large land settlement. We discuss how such an approach offers new opportunities for an improved assessment of induced and spontaneous structuring factors for restoring and for monitoring plant communities during ecological restoration.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01714.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = life-form, life history, leaf persistence, canopy height, canopy structure, type of reproduction, dispersal type, seed weight, seed shape, growth form, flowering phenology, type of clonality",

We tested this assumption by assessing how stacked-species distribution models (S-SDMs) perform for predicting plant species assemblages along elevation gradients. Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods Using robust presenceabsence data, we first assessed the ability of topo-climatic S-SDMs to predict plant assemblages in a study area encompassing a 2800-m wide elevation gradient. We then assessed the relationships among several evaluation metrics and trait-based tests of community assembly rules. Results The standard errors of individual SDMs decreased significantly towards higher elevations. Overall, the S-SDM overpredicted far more than they underpredicted richness and could not reproduce the humpback curve along elevation. Overprediction was greater at low and mid-range elevations in absolute values but greater at high elevations when standardized by the actual richness. Looking at species composition, overall prediction success, kappa and specificity increased with increasing elevation, while the Jaccard index and sensitivity decreased. The best overall evaluation as driven by specificity occurred at high elevation where species assemblages were shown to be subject to significant environmental filtering of small plants. In contrast, the decreased overall accuracy in the lowlands was associated with functional patterns representing any type of assembly rule (environmental filtering, limiting similarity or null assembly). Main conclusions We provide a thorough evaluation of S-SDM emphasizing the need to carefully interpret standard evaluation metrics, which reflect different aspects of assemblage predictions. We further reported interesting patterns of change in S-SDM errors with changes in assembly rules along elevation. Yet, significant levels of assemblage prediction errors occurred throughout the gradient, calling for further improvement of SDMs, e.g. by adding key environmental filters that act at fine scales and developing approaches to account for variations in the influence of predictors along environmental gradients.",10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00790.x,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = canopy height, SLA, LDMC",

Trait-based comparative analyses are useful in this regard as they can help identify the key drivers of decline, and highlight traits that promote resistance to change. Despite their popularity trait-based comparative analyses tend to focus on explaining variation in range shift and extinction risk, seldom being applied to actual measures of species decline. Furthermore they have tended to be taxonomically restricted to birds, mammals, plants and butterflies. Here we utilise a novel approach to estimate occurrence trends for the Odonata in Britain and Ireland, and examine trait correlates of these trends using a recently available trait dataset. We found the dragonfly fauna in Britain and Ireland has undergone considerable change between 1980 and 2012, with 22 and 53% of species declining and increasing, respectively. Distribution region, habitat specialism and range size were the key traits associated with these trends, where habitat generalists that occupy southern Britain tend to have increased in comparison to the declining narrow-ranged specialist species. In combination with previous evidence, we conclude that the lower trend estimates for the narrow-ranged specialists could be a sign of biotic homogenization with ecological specialists being replaced by warm-adapted generalists.",10.7717/peerj.1410,Y,0,0,0,0,1,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,,"traits = species status (rare to widespread), distribution region, thorax length, flight period duration, habitat breadth, breeding habitat, overwintering stage,",

Here, we introduce and test a novel conceptual trait-based model describing how the effects of soil eutrophication cascade to higher trophic levels across differential plant-herbivore interactions.Location Northern Europe.Methods We synthesize previous literature on the effects of nitrogen on plants and herbivorous insects as well as relevant multispecies patterns of insect communities concerning species dietary breadth, body size, dispersal propensity and voltinism in order to derive the model. We empirically evaluate the proposed, hitherto untested, four main model pathways using statistical modelling and data on 1064 northern European butterfly and moth species, their life-history traits, phylogeny and population trends.Results We show that across all species: (1) larval dietary breadth and host plant foliar nitrogen content are positively and equally strongly related to insect body size, and that (2) multivoltinism, host plant preferences for soil nitrogen, body size and larval dietary breadth are positively related to population trends of butterflies and moths as predicted by the model. Positive relationships between plant foliar nitrogen content and body size as well as multivoltinism and population trends are the first multispecies demonstrations for these patterns.Main conclusions Soil nitrogen enrichment amplifies the diverging trends of herbivorous insects feeding on nitrophilous versus nitrophobous plants through differential plant-herbivore interactions, causing predictable changes in community composition at higher trophic levels. A positive foliar nitrogeninsect body size relationship, now empirically supported, is the integrating link within this cascade.

"Price, JN; Partel, M",2013,Can limiting similarity increase invasion resistance? A meta-analysis of experimental studies,OIKOS,"The principle of limiting similarity suggests that species must be functionally different to coexist; based on the assumption that inter-specific competition should be greatest between functionally similar species. There has been controversy over the generality of this assembly rule for plant communities with some studies finding evidence for limiting similarity and others not. One approach to testing this is to examine the invasion' success of species into communities in which the functional group composition has been manipulated. Using a meta-analysis approach, we examined the generality of limiting similarity for plant communities based on published experimental studies. We asked is establishment of an invading species less successful if it belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community compared to a community in which that functional group is absent? We explored separately colonisation (i.e. germination, establishment or seedling survival) and performance (i.e. biomass, cover or growth) of different functional groups (forbs and grasses) and experimental designs (removal experiments of more or less natural communities and synthetic-assemblage experiments). We found that communities containing functionally similar resident species did reduce invader colonisation and performance of forb invaders, but did not reduce colonisation or performance of grass invaders. Evidence in support of limiting similarity was only detected in synthetic-assemblage experiments and not when studies used functional group removal from natural' communities. Functional similarity is an important aspect of biotic resistance for forb invaders, but was only found in artificial communities. This has implications for restoration ecology especially when communities are built de novo. However, we suggest that limiting similarity plays a limited role in biotic resistance, because no evidence was detected in established communities.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.00121.x,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = 'functional group' categorized as (c4/c3 grasses, legumes, non leguminous forbs) - I'm calling these life history traits",

A review in light of new Mediterranean data,FLORA,"Nursery pollination interactions are widespread between Caryophyllaceae species and the pollinating-seed predator Hadena moths (Noctuidae). A previous revision of this system was based mainly on widely distributed species in the north and center of Europe. However, there was no information from the Mediterranean region, one of the global diversification centers of both taxa. The aim of this work is to review the progress on the knowledge of this nursery pollination system since the first revision, providing unpublished data of Caryophyllaceae-Hadena associations from Spain. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary network analysis to illustrate the advantages of this approach to explore nursery pollination systems. In the last 10 years, most of studies have focused on selective forces exerted by Hadena on the plant reproductive traits through pollination and predation. Hadena moths are selectively attracted by flower scents, flower sizes and number of flowers per plant are also crucial for attraction of the moths. Caryophyllaceae species may have developed some phenological, chemical, morphogical and physiological adaptations to avoid overexploitation by larvae. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in Caryophyllaceae may be a consequence of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Other pollinators as well as an anther smut fungus and larval parasitoids are important selective agents that can shift this interaction between mutualism and parasitism. Whereas most studies highlighted the parasitic nature of the Hadena-Caryophyllaceae interaction, we need further analyses on the pollinator effectiveness of Hadena and on the spatio-temporal variation of the interaction outcome. Based on our field surveys and bibliographic records we found evidence of nursery pollination between 22 noctuid species (mostly Hadena) and 70 Caryophyllaceae species from 11 genera (mostly Silene and Dianthus). From these interactions, 26 were new for the Iberian Peninsula and 18 were not described before. Results of our preliminary network analysis suggest that these interactions are constrained by phylogenetic, geographical and ecological filters. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

When a photogrammetrically estimated mass is used as a covariate in regression modeling, the error associated with estimating mass induces bias in regression statistics and decreases model explanatory power. Thus, it is important to understand and account for prediction variance when addressing ecological questions that require use of estimated mass values. In a simulation study based on data collected from Weddell seals, we developed regression models of pup weaning mass as a function of maternal postparturition mass where maternal mass was directly measured and second where maternal mass was photogrammetrically estimated. We demonstrate that when estimated mass was used, the regression coefficient was biased toward zero and the coefficient of determination was 30% less than the value obtained when using maternal postparturition mass obtained from direct measurement. After applying bias correction procedures, however, the regression coefficient and coefficient of determination were within 2% of their true values. To effectively use photogrammetrically estimated masses, prediction variance should be understood and accounted for in all analyses.

"Pruitt, Jonathan N.; Riechert, Susan E.",2009,Sex matters: sexually dimorphic fitness consequences of a behavioural syndrome,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"There is growing evidence that correlated behavioural traits, or behavioural syndromes, influence behavioural evolution in some taxa. Few studies, however, investigate whether the effects of a syndrome are the same for both sexes. We test whether variation in social tendency, inferred from interindividual distance, is correlated with other aspects of behaviour in male comb-footed spiders, Anelosimus studiosus. We compared these results to those from previous studies on female social tendency to determine (1) whether both sexes share the same behavioural syndrome and (2) whether its effects on mating success are the same for both sexes. Trait types in the syndrome analysis include foraging behaviour, anti-predator behaviour, exploratory behaviour and activity level. Our results suggest male A. studiosus, like females, can be categorized into two social classes: an aggregative (social) class and an intolerant (asocial) class. Social males (i.e. those with lower interindividual distance scores) were generally less aggressive towards prey and predators, and were less active. Furthermore, we provide evidence from a parent/offspring breeding study for an additive genetic component to male social tendency (heritability 0.32). To determine the influence of the male syndrome on mating success, we performed staged male-male contests between social and asocial males for access to females. We found that male social tendency was the single best predictor of success in these trials, with asocial males outperforming social. This finding is opposite to the trend observed in female A. studiosus, where social females experience higher mating success.

Comparisons of phylogenetic and functional (alpha and beta) diversity with taxonomic diversity can provide insights into the extent to which community assembly is driven by deterministic or stochastic processes, but comparative approaches have yet to be applied to successional systems. We characterized taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional plant (alpha and beta) diversity within and between four successional stages in a > 270-year-long arable-to-grassland chronosequence. Null models were used to test whether functional and phylogenetic turnover differed from random expectations, given the levels of species diversity. The three facets of diversity showed different patterns of change during succession. Between early and early-mid succession, species richness increased but there was no increase in functional or phylogenetic diversity. Higher than predicted levels of functional similarity between species within the early and early-mid successional stages, indicate that abiotic filters have selected for sets of functionally similar species within sites. Between late-mid and late succession, there was no further increase in species richness, but a significant increase in functional alpha diversity, suggesting that functionally redundant species were replaced by functionally more dissimilar species. Functional turnover between stages was higher than predicted, and higher than within-stage turnover, indicating that different assembly processes act at different successional stages. Synthesis. Analysis of spatial and temporal turnover in different facets of diversity suggests that deterministic processes generate biodiversity during post-disturbance ecosystem development and that the relative importance of assembly processes has changed over time. Trait-mediated abiotic filtering appears to play an important role in community assembly during the early and early-mid stages of arable-to-grassland succession, whereas the relative importance of competitive exclusion appears to have increased towards the later successional stages. Phylogenetic diversity provided a poor reflection of functional diversity and did not contribute to inferences about underlying assembly processes.

However, the extent to which the diversity of dispersal and persistence traits in plant communities is determined by the current and historical characteristics of sites and their surrounding landscape has yet to be explored. Using quantitative information on long-distance seed dispersal potential by wind and animals (dispersal in space) and on species' persistence/longevity (dispersal in time), we (i) compared levels of dispersal and persistence trait diversity (functional richness, FRic, and functional divergence, FDiv) in seminatural grassland plant communities with those expected by chance, and (ii) quantified the extent to which trait diversity was explained by current and historical landscape structure and local management history - taking into account spatial and phylogenetic autocorrel. Null model analysis revealed that more grassland communities than expected had a level of trait diversity that was lower or higher than predicted, given the level of species richness. Both the range (FRic) and divergence (FDiv) of dispersal and persistence trait values increased with grassland age. FDiv was mainly explained by the interaction between current grazing intensity and the amount of grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape in 1938.Synthesis. The study suggests that the variability of dispersal and persistence traits in grassland plant communities is driven by deterministic assembly processes, with both history and current management (and their interactions), playing a major role as determinants of trait diversity. While a long continuity of grazing management is likely to have promoted the diversity of dispersal and persistence traits in present-day grasslands, communities in sites that are well grazed at the present day, and were also surrounded by large amounts of grassland in the past, showed the highest diversity of dispersal and persistence strategies. Our results indicate that the historical context of a site within a landscape will influence the extent to which current grazing management is able to maintain a diversity of dispersal and persistence strategies and buffer communities (and their associated functions) against continuing habitat fragmentation.",10.1111/1365-2745.12199,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = seed dispersal potential, persistetence/longevity",
"Pysek, P; Richardson, DM; Williamson, M",2004,Predicting and explaining plant invasions through analysis of source area floras: some critical considerations,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"Comparing species that become invasive with others from the same regional species pool that do not invade raises several issues about the accuracy of analyses attempting to define the determinants of invasiveness. The delimitation of the source area and deciding which species group(s) to include are especially relevant in analyses focusing on species originating in Europe. Historical patterns of immigration of alien species into Europe must be considered since European floras comprise a complex mix of native species, historical introductions (archaeophytes) and relative newcomers (neophytes). We make three main points: (1) Archaeophytes (species introduced to Europe before the discovery of America) differ from natives in a number of traits and in historical association with people; it is misleading to lump archaeophytes with native taxa. (2) Taxa from climatically and geographically different regions, representing distinct floristic geoelements, need to be treated separately, and not as a homogenous pool of potential invaders. Restricting the source species pool to native taxa with comparable phytogeographical characteristics reduces the variation associated with chance of dispersal by humans from the source area. (3) For prediction, a clear distinction should be made between accuracy (the proportion of those found to be alien that were also predicted to be there) and reliability (or predictive value, the proportion of those predicted to become aliens that do so). Information accumulated over centuries by botanists in Central Europe provides an excellent opportunity to deal with these issues and avoid spurious results. To illustrate these issues, we revisit a recently published study of Central-European plant species as invaders in two Argentinean provinces (Prinzing et al., 2002) to explore and demonstrate the implications of the above points. We hope that future studies will build on these points to achieve more reliable predictions.",10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00079.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Latitude and elevation generate two major thermal gradients, and temperature minimum and seasonality can drive community assembly, but few studies have tested if community assembly along both latitudinal and elevational gradients within the same region generates similar patterns of assembly. Here, we test hypotheses on the relations of mean family age (MFA) of angiosperm trees in local communities with environmental temperature and compare the relations between latitudinal and elevational gradients in eastern North America. Location: USA. Method: We used correlation and regression analyses and structure equation modelling approach to assess the relation of MFA to elevation, latitude and climatic variables, which included minimum temperature, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. Results: The MFA of a local forest community decreased with increasing latitude and elevation for all gradients examined. For each gradient, the slope of the relationship between MFA and latitude or elevation was steeper for forest communities with larger values of MFA than for those with smaller values of MFA, and the standard deviation of MFA decreased with increasing latitude and elevation. MFA decreased significantly with decreasing minimum temperature for both latitudinal and elevational gradients, but the slope of the relationship between MFA and minimum temperature was steeper for elevational gradients than for latitudinal gradients. Minimum temperature had a much stronger relationship with MFA than temperature seasonality for both latitudinal and elevational gradients.

Although tropical conservatism is a widely used explanatory framework along temperature gradients, it is unclear whether cold tolerance is primarily a threshold effect (e.g. freezing tolerance) or represents a more continuous constraint. Nor is it clear whether cold tolerance is the only major axis of conservatism or whether others, such as water-stress tolerance, are additionally important or trade-off against cold tolerance. We address these questions by testing associated predictions for forest plots distributed across 35 degrees latitude.LocationChina.MethodsWe recorded all trees within 57 0.1-ha plots, generated a phylogeny for the 462 angiosperm species found, and calculated phylogenetic diversity (standardized PD), net relatedness index (NRI) and phylogenetic species variability (PSV) for each plot. We tested the predictions using regression, variance partitioning and structural equation modelling to disentangle potential influences of key climate variables on NRI and PSV, and of all variables on species richness.ResultsSpecies richness correlated very strongly with minimum temperature, nonlinearly overall but linearly where freezing is absent. The phylogenetic variables also correlated strongly with minimum temperature. While NRI and PSV explained little additional variance in species richness, they accounted for part of the species richness-current climate correlation. Water stress added minimal explanatory power. All these variables showed strong latitudinal gradients.Main conclusionsMinimum temperature appeared to primarily control tree species richness, via both a threshold-like freezing effect and a linear relationship in climates without freezing.

The birth-death polytomy resolver is a method of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty that places missing (unsampled) taxa onto phylogenetic trees, using taxonomic information alone. Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate pseudoposterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the species level, even in the absence of genetic data for many species. Many researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution, geography, and community assembly. I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving traits. Because species are placed on trees at random with respect to trait values, the birth-death polytomy resolver breaks down natural patterns of trait phylogenetic structure. Inferences based on these trees are predictably and often drastically biased in a direction that depends on the underlying (true) pattern of phylogenetic structure in traits.

We performed a RLQ analysis to relate six functional traits, associated with resource acquisition, competition, colonization ability and phenology, to the age of the outcrops. We found the prominence of two main axes of specialization, one related to resource acquisition and the other to reproduction and regeneration. We further examined the community-level variation in ecological strategies to assess the abiotic and biotic drivers of community assembly. Using trait-based statistics of functional richness, regularity and divergence, we found that different processes drove the variation in ecological strategies along the axes of specialization. In late succession, functional convergence was detected for the traits related to resource acquisition as a signature of habitat filtering, while the coexistence of contrasted strategies was found for the traits related to reproduction and regeneration as a result of spatial micro-heterogeneity.

"Rall, BC; Kalinkat, G; Ott, D; Vucic-Pestic, O; Brose, U",2011,Taxonomic versus allometric constraints on non-linear interaction strengths,OIKOS,"Recently, the importance of body mass and allometric scaling for the structure and dynamics of ecological networks has been highlighted in several ground-breaking studies. However, advances in the understanding of generalities across ecosystem types are impeded to a considerable extent by a methodological dichotomy contrasting a considerable portion of marine ecology on the one hand opposite to traditional community ecology on the other hand. Many marine ecologists are bound to the taxonomy-neglecting size spectrum approach when describing and analysing community patterns. In contrast, the mindset of the other school is focused on taxonomies according to the Linnean system at the cost of obscuring information due to applying species or population averages of body masses and other traits. Following other pioneering studies, we addressed this lingering gap, and studied non-linear interaction strengths (i.e. functional responses) between two taxonomically-distinct terrestrial arthropod predators (centipedes and spiders) of varying individual body masses and their prey. We fitted three non-linear functional response models to the data: (1) a taxonomic model not accounting for variance in body masses amongst predator individuals, (2) an allometric model ignoring taxonomic differences between predator individuals, and (3) a combined model including body mass and taxonomic effects. Ranked according to their AICs, the combined model performs better than the allometric model, which provides a superior fit to the data than the taxonomic model. These results strongly indicate that the body masses of predator and prey individuals were responsible for most of the variation in non-linear interaction strengths. Taxonomy explained some specific patterns in allometric exponents between groups and revealed mechanistic insights in predation efficiencies. Reconciling quantitative allometric models as employed by the marine size-spectrum approach with taxonomic information may thus yield quantitative results that are generalized across ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. Using these quantitative models as novel null models should also strengthen subsequent taxonomic analyses.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18860.x,Y,0,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,1,0,1,1,traits = body size,

Is there a delayed functional response to fragmentation? Location: Thirty remnant Banksia woodlands, Perth, Australia. Methods: We used GLMM to examine the effects of remnant age and area, and their interaction, on the relative abundance and functional diversity (FD) of five plant functional traits: growth form, pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient acquisition and regeneration strategies. We then used fourth-corner analysis to examine the influence of a wider set of fragmentation-related factors on trait abundances. Results: The functional composition and diversity of Banksia woodlands changed with remnant age, particularly in the smaller remnants. Plants more prone to decline with remnant age were the growth form shrubs, root-clustered trees, herbaceous obligate seeders and understorey species that are insect-pollinated, have seeds dispersal internally by animals and have arbuscular or ericoid mycorrhizas. In contrast, plants more prone to persist were growth forms trees, sedges and rushes, ectomycorrhizal trees, herbaceous resprouters, wind-pollinated and root-clustered understorey species. FD increased with remnant age in the growth forms and overstorey, but declined among the herbaceous and shrub pollination and nutrient acquisition traits. Conclusions: Functional traits that consistently signalled the plant community response to fragmentation were growth form, pollination and dispersal. This functional response was largely delayed, suggesting a functional extinction debt, which will lead to a further decline of plants with vulnerable trait states in the future, especially in the small- and medium-sized remnants. Our study illustrates the vulnerability of small remnants to changes in community assembly and ecosystem function due to fragmentation. Furthermore, it exemplifies how a functional trait approach is valuable to understand the impacts of urbanization on remnant plant communities, before local extinctions may occur. Finally, the study shows how cities' fragmentation history and biogeographic settings provide an important context influencing plant functional responses to urbanization-related processes.",10.1111/jvs.12615,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Urban ,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,0,1,"traits: growth form, pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient acquisition and regeneration strategies",
"Ramos-Jiliberto, R; Frodden, E; Aranguiz-Acuna, A",2007,Pre-encounter versus post-encounter inducible defenses in predator-prey model systems,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"It has been reported that, in order to reduce mortality, prey are able to change their phenotype in response to cues released from predators. These short-time responses constitute effective antipredator strategies in variable environments, and involve changes in morphology, behavior, physiology or life-history traits of prey individuals belonging to a wide spectrum of taxa. Defenses can be classified into pre-encounter and post-encounter, depending on the phase of the predation process in which they take place. Also, inducible defenses should be costly. Despite the current knowledge of inducible defenses at the individual level, our understanding of their dynamic consequences at the population and community level is limited. In this work we construct and analyze numerically a predator-prey system, parameterized from published experimental data, in which prey exhibit inducible defenses of the type pre-encounter (affecting attack rate) or post-encounter (affecting handling time) and entailing either metabolic or feeding costs. The above assumptions were analyzed over a gradient of resource availability. Our results indicated that both types of cost have a similar effect on the dynamics of the model system, but we expect that different costs will produce different outcomes in a more complex model community. Conversely, pre-encounter and post-encounter IDs define domains of attraction with different size and shape within the studied sections of the multidimensional parameter space. Roughly speaking, post-encounter IDs determine a more rich dynamics when plausible parameter values are chosen, and the effect of resource density is different if the ID is handling-time based or attack-rate based. In agreement with previous works, our analyses indicate that IDs can damp population oscillations and prevent the paradox of enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the hypothesis that inducible defenses increase the stability of tritrophic chains is tested, through the numerical analysis of a continuous-time model that discriminate between defenses affecting attack rate of predators, and defenses affecting predator handling time. In addition, discrimination between feeding costs of defenses affecting attack rate, and metabolic costs affecting feeding requirement for zero growth are considered. System stability was examined by computing dominant Lyapunov exponents, and through continuation routines of bifurcation points. Background parameter values were taken from two published studies. Our results show that a tritrophic system will generally be stabilized by the incorporation of inducible defenses and by their associated costs, but a number of new outcomes were obtained. Different long-term behavior is predicted if either one or two prey populations exhibit defenses. In the latter case, the defense of the basal prey dominates the dynamics. Handling time based inducible defenses exert a stronger stabilizing effect than attack rate based ones, but also impose a higher extinction risk for top predators. Inducible defenses in particular and trait-mediated indirect effects in general can be important sources of stability in natural systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Expanding international trade has facilitated invasions of numerous insects and pathogens into new regions. Many of these invasions have caused substantial forest damage, economic impacts and losses of ecosystem goods and services provided by trees. Climate change is already affecting the geographic distribution of host trees and their associated insects and pathogens, with anticipated increases in pest impacts by both native and invasive pests. Although climate change will benefit many forest insects, changes in thermal conditions may disrupt evolved life history traits and cause phenological mismatches. Individually, the threats posed to forest ecosystems by invasive pests and climate change are serious. Although interactions between these two drivers and their outcomes are poorly understood and hence difficult to predict, it is clear that the cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems will be exacerbated. Here we introduce and synthesize the information in this special issue of Forestry with articles that illustrate the impacts of invasions of insects and pathogens, climate change, forest management and their interactions, as well as methods to predict, assess and mitigate these impacts.

In this context, one crucial task is to identify and measure plant traits, which respond to land-use intensity (response traits) and simultaneously have an impact on ecosystem functions (effect traits). We hypothesized that species-specific leaf chemical composition, which may function both as response and effect trait, can be derived from Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy tools in combination with multivariate statistical methods We investigated leaf ATR-FTIR spectra of two grasses, Poa pratensis L. and Dactylis glomerata L., and one forb, Achillea millefolium L collected in grassland plots along a land-use intensity gradient in three regions of Germany. ATR-FTIR spectra appear to function as biochemical fingerprints unique to each species. The spectral response to land-use intensity was not consistent among species and less apparent in the two grasses than in the forb species. Whereas land-use intensification enhanced protein and cellulose content in A. millefolium, giving rise to changes in six spectral bands in the frequency range of 1088-1699 cm(-1), only cellulose content increased in D. glomerata, affecting the bands of 1385-1394 cm(-1). Poa pratensis spectra exhibited minimal changes under the influence of land-use, only in the spectral bands of 1373-1375 cm(-1) associated with suberin-like aliphatic compounds. Our findings suggest that some species' leaf chemical composition is responsive to land-use intensity, and thus, may have a predictive value for ecosystem services provided by those species within grassland vegetation (i.e., herbage yield quality).",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.047,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

These factors result in freshwater communities that are clearly distinct from continental systems. Chironomid spatial and temporal distribution was investigated in chironomid assemblages at 21 sites across the Azores Archipelago. Results using PERMANOVA, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance, indicated significant longitudinal differences in assemblages but none between islands or over time. Links between hydromorphological and physicochemical variables and the community assemblage were assessed using DISTLM, a linear model for distance-based multivariate analysis. The percentage of variation explained by hydromorphological factors (31%) was slightly higher than that explained by physicochemical (28%) factors. Descriptors of land use (forest area, scrub area, natural area of catchment) and stream slope were found to be the best environmental predictors of chironomid assemblages in Azores. Physicochemical variables such as temperature, pH, nitrite, iron and conductivity were the principal drivers of change in chironomid composition in stream locations. Headwater sites, characterized by lower temperature, acid to neutral pH values, low conductivity, nutrient and metal concentrations were dominated by Rheocricotopus atripes. Mid-section sites, located in agricultural areas were dominated by Thienemanniella clavicornis. Urbanized lower reaches were characterized by higher temperature, pH, conductivity and nutrient levels and were dominated by Cricotopus sp. These results give essential information that allows us to predict the response of different chironomid species to hydromorphological and physicochemical gradients across the archipelago's streams contributing providing the basis for the development of tools for the implementation of the Water Frame Directive.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,traits not actually measured,

Novel interactions between previously non-overlapping species may, however, also be mediated by altered plants' responses to herbivore attack. Syndromes of plant defences and tolerance are driven by inherited functional traits, biotic and abiotic conditions, and the geographical and historical contingencies affecting the community. Therefore, understanding climate change-driven herbivore responses and evolution towards a particular plant defence syndrome is key to forecasting species interactions in the near future. In this paper, we first document variations in herbivory, and plant defences along altitudinal gradients that act as natural experiments'. We then use an empirical model to predict how specialist herbivore abundance may shift with respect to elevation in the near future. Our field surveys and field experiment showed a decrease in herbivory with elevation. However, contrary to expectations, our meta-regression analyses showed that plant defences, particularly leaf toughness and flavonoid compounds, tend to be higher at high elevations, while secondary metabolites showed no clear trend with elevation. Based on those results, we discuss how plant communities and species-specific plant defence syndromes will change in response to the climate-driven herbivore colonization of higher altitudes. Particularly, plant from high elevation, due to high protection against abiotic stress may be already ecologically fitted to resist the sudden increase in herbivory pressure that they will likely experience during global change.",10.1111/1365-2435.12135,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Alpine,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = defence syndrome,

These colonial-era legacies are problematic, because they fail to recognize the unique diversity of Asian savannahs and the critical roles of fire and herb ivory in maintaining ecosystem health and diversity. In this review, we show that: the palaeo-historical evidence suggests that the savannahs of Asia have existed for at least 1 million years, long before widespread landscape modification by humans; savannah regions across Asia have levels of C-4 grass endemism and diversity that are consistent with area-based expectations for non-Asian savannahs; there are at least three distinct Asian savannah communities, namely deciduous broadleaf savannahs, deciduous fine-leafed and spiny savannahs and evergreen pine savannahs, with distinct functional ecologies consistent with fire- and herbivory-driven community assembly. Via an analysis of savannah climate domains on other continents, we map the potential extent of savannahs across Asia. We find that the climates of African savannahs provide the closest analogues for those of Asian deciduous savannahs, but that Asian pine savannahs occur in climates different to any of the savannahs in the southern continents. Finally, we review major threats to the persistence of savannahs in Asia, including the mismanagement of fire and herbivory, alien woody encroachment, afforestation policies and future climate uncertainty associated with the changing Asian monsoon.

"Raubenheimer, D",2011,Toward a quantitative nutritional ecology: the right-angled mixture triangle,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"A recent area of progress in nutritional ecology is a growing awareness that nutritional phenotypes are best understood in a multidimensional context, where foraging is viewed as a process of balancing the intake and use of multiple nutrients to satisfy complex and dynamic nutrient needs. Numerous laboratory studies have shown that this view can yield novel insights into unresolved questions and provide a framework for generating new hypotheses. By contrast, progress with this multidimensional view has been slow in the arena of ultimate interest to functional biologists, the field. One reason for this is that the Geometric Framework for nutrition that has been extensively used in laboratory experiments focuses on amounts of nutrients (e.g., required, eaten, or retained), and such data are typically very difficult or impossible to collect for most free-ranging animals. Further, many problems in field-based nutritional ecology involve comparisons of mixtures that are expressed as proportions (e.g., food, diet, body, or fecal compositions), rather than absolute amounts. As yet, however, no geometric framework has been established in nutritional ecology for this. Here I recommend an approach for the geometric analysis of nutritional mixtures, and illustrate its use in a variety of contexts by reanalyzing published data. Despite its simplicity, this approach holds considerable promise for furthering the study of field-based nutritional ecology.",10.1890/10-1707.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Trait-based approaches have offered some promise, especially in cases where deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and niche differentiation shape communities. In this study, we asked how much intraspecific variation contributes to trait distributions within and among plant communities, and whether trait distributions resulting from environmental filtering and niche differentiation can predict accurately the relative species abundances of montane plant species in local communities. LocationWest Elk Mountains, Colorado, USA. MethodsWe collected functional trait, species composition and environmental data from 14 sites along a broad climate gradient in Colorado, USA, ranging in elevation from 2480 to 3560m. We partitioned the variation within and among sites into intraspecific and interspecific components, and compared the results to values from a recent global meta-analysis, which examined intraspecific trait variability patterns. We also used these data to parameterize statistical models that have been shown to reproduce patterns associated with the processes of environmental filtering and niche differentiation. We fit two models to the data, one assuming that niche differentiation is invariant among sites, and another assuming that niche differentiation varies among sites. ResultsWe found that the trait-based models were worse at predicting species relative abundances in local communities than a null model assuming equal abundances of all species. One plausible explanation for the poor performance of the models is that intraspecific variation in functional traits, which in our system was higher than the global averages documented in the meta-analysis, swamped the effects of interspecific variation in functional traits along the climatic gradient. In particular, almost all variation in root traits was within rather than among species, even among sites.

This is abundantly clear for plant species along elevational gradients, where parallel abiotic selection pressures give rise to predictable variation in leaf phenotypes among ecosystems. Understanding the factors responsible for such patterns may provide insight into the current and future drivers of biodiversity, local community structure and ecosystem function. In order to explore patterns in trait variation along elevational gradients, we conducted a meta-analysis of published observational studies that measured three key leaf functional traits that are associated with axes of variation in both resource competition and stress tolerance: leaf mass:area ratio (LMA), leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (N-mass) and N content per unit area (N-area). To examine whether there may be evidence for a genetic basis underlying the trait variation, we conducted a review of published results from common garden experiments that measured the same leaf traits. Within studies, LMA and N-area tended to decrease with mean annual temperature (MAT) along elevational gradients, while N-mass did not vary systematically with MAT. Correlations among pairs of traits varied significantly with MAT: LMA was most strongly correlated with N-mass and N-area at high-elevation sites with relatively lower MAT. The strengths of the relationships were equal or greater within species relative to the relationships among species, suggesting parallel evolutionary dynamics along elevational gradients among disparate biomes. Evidence from common garden studies further suggests that there is an underlying genetic basis to the functional trait variation that we documented along elevational gradients. Taken together, these results indicate that environmental filtering both selects locally adapted genotypes within plant species and constrains species to elevational ranges based on their ranges of potential leaf trait values. If individual phenotypes are filtered from populations in the same way that species are filtered from regional species pools, changing climate may affect both the species and functional trait composition of plant communities.",10.1111/1365-2435.12162,Y,0,0,0,1,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Leaf mass:area ratio, leaf N content per unit mass, N content per unit area",

Many ecological studies, however, use simple linear models to test for such relationships, including species identity as the predictor variable and some measured trait or function as the response variable without accounting for the nestedness of genetic variation across levels of organization. This omission may lead to incorrect inference about which source of variation influences community and ecosystem properties. Here, we explicitly compare this common approach to alternative ways of modeling variation in trait data, using simulated trait data and empirical results of common-garden trials using multiple levels of genetic variation within Eucalyptus, Populus and Picea. We show that: 1) when nested variation is ignored, an incorrect conclusion of species effect is drawn in up to 20% of cases; 2) overestimation of the species effect increases - up to 60% in some scenarios - as the nested term explains more of the variation; and 3) the sample sizes needed to overcome these potential problems associated with aggregating nested hierarchical variation may be impractically large. In common-garden trials, incorporating nested models increased explanatory power twofold for mammal browsing rate in Eucalyptus, threefold for leaf area in Populus, and tenfold for branch number in Picea.

If PFTs are possible to detect and discriminate spectrally, then it may be possible to use remote sensing applications to map ecosystem processes or services within and across landscapes. As a first step towards this application, we explored whether functional groups of 22 dominant South African wetland species were spectrally separable based on their PFTs. We measured 23 biochemical and morphological PFTs in combination with spectra from 350 to 2349 nm using a handheld radiometer. First, we evaluated the possibility of accurately predicting morphological and biochemical PFTs from reflectance spectra using three approaches: spectrum averaging, redundancy analysis (RDA), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Second, we established whether functional groups and species were spectrally distinguishable. We found seven PFTs to be important in at least two of the three approaches: four morphological and three biochemicals. Morphological traits that were important were leaf area (PISA: r(2) = 0.40, regression: r(2) = 0.41), specific leaf area (r(2) = 0.67), leaf mass (r(2) = 0.43, r(2) = 0.38), and leaf length/width ratio (r(2) = 0.62). Biochemical traits that play a role in the structural composition of vegetation, like lignin content (r(2) = 0.98, r(2) = 0.54), concentration (r(2) = 0.45) and cellulose content (r(2) = 0.57, r(2) = 0.49), were found to be important by at least two of the analyses. Three other traits were important in at least one of the analyses: total biomass (r(2) = 0.56), leaf C/N ratio (r(2) = 0.99), and cellulose concentration (r(2) = 0.76). Redundancy analysis suggests that there is a large percentage (52%) of the spectrum not explained by the PFTs measured in this study. However, spectral discrimination of functional groups, and even species, appears promising, mostly in the ultraviolet A part of the spectrum.

It is possible that the ecological characteristics of some species render them especially vulnerable to extinction. Previous analyses of a diverse array of taxa have identified a number of intrinsic ecological predictors of vulnerability, but snakes have not been studied in this respect, We collated ecological data on Australian venomous snake species in the family Elapidae, based primarily on examination of preserved specimens in museums, to investigate possible differences between threatened and nonthreatened taxa. We also used comparative (phylogenetically based) analyses to identify functional associations with endangerment. Correlates of conservation vulnerability identified in previous studies did not discriminate successfully between threatened and nonthreatened elapid species. However, threatened and nonthreatened elapids differed significantly in two main respects. First, threatened species tended to rely on ambush foraging rather than actively searching for prey. Sit-and-wait foragers may be vulnerable because (1) they rely on sites with specific types of ground cover, and anthropogenic activities disrupt these habitat features, and (2) ambush foraging is associated with a suite of life-history traits that involve low, rates of feeding, growth, and reproduction. The second major correlate of endangerment involves the mating system. Endangered species typically lacked mate-male combat: In such taxa, females grow, larger than males and are more vulnerable to human predation (as judged by the composition of museum collections).

Uncertainties regarding the protectiveness of such approaches to risk assessment might be addressed by assessment factors that are often under discussion. As an alternative approach, plant community models can be used to predict potential effects on plant communities of interest based on extrapolation of the individual-level effects measured in the standardized greenhouse experiments. In this study, we analyzed the reliability and adequacy of the plant community model IBC-grass (individual-based plant community model for grasslands) by comparing model predictions with empirically measured effects at the plant community level.ResultsWe showed that the effects predicted by the model IBC-grass were in accordance with the empirical data. Based on the species-specific dose responses (calculated from empirical effects in monocultures measured 4weeks after application), the model was able to realistically predict short-term herbicide impacts on communities when compared to empirical data.ConclusionThe results presented in this study demonstrate an approach how the current standard greenhouse experimentsmeasuring herbicide impacts on individual-levelcan be coupled with the model IBC-grass to estimate effects on plant community level. In this way, it can be used as a tool in ecological risk assessment.",10.1186/s12302-018-0174-9,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In this study we analyse how offspring fitness constrains spawning phenology in a large migratory apex predator, the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The reproductive schedule of Atlantic bluefin tuna varies between spawning sites, suggesting plasticity to local environmental conditions. Generally, temperature is considered to be the main constraint on tuna spawning phenology. We combine evidence from long-term field data, temperature-controlled rearing experiments on eggs and larvae, and a model of egg fitness, and show that Atlantic bluefin tuna do not spawn to optimize egg and larval temperature exposure. The timing of spawning leads to temperature exposure considerably lower than optimal at all spawning grounds across the Atlantic Ocean. The early spawning is constrained by thermal inhibition of egg hatching and larval growth rates, but some other factors must prevent later spawning. Matching offspring with ocean productivity and the prey peak might be an important driver for bluefin tuna spawning phenology.

How much morphological variability is functional given the common potential for stochastic founder effects when new habitats are colonized?Organism and sites: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 56 isolated watersheds with separate marine ancestry encompassing 102 freshwater localities ranging from large oligotrophic mountain lakes to darkly stained bog lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago, western Canada.Field data: Biophysical attributes of the habitat (lake volume, depth, percent light transmission at 400 nm, calcium availability, pH, distance to marine waters, predation regime including puncturing, compression, and grappling species), morphological traits of the fish (body size, body depth, lateral plate number and position, dorsal spine length, pelvic girdle size, ascending process height, cross-sectional diameter, basal and lateral plate structural overlap), and geographical distance between localities. Based on previous surveys in this archipelago, we predicted the greatest expression of post-capture defences in lakes with high water clarity and the greatest reduction in small stained ponds, as this characterizes regular shifts in the predation landscape.Analyses: Principal components, univariate linear models, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analyses.Results: Populations range from 30 to 90 mm in adult male standard length, from full-plated to naked, and from full-spined to un-spined. Again and again, populations converge towards functional multivariate or univariate phenotypes predicted by the biophysical attributes of each habitat, primarily lake volume, aquatic spectra, and predation regime. Across a broad diversity of lake volumes, body size is larger in stained lakes and we hypothesize that this is a defence adaptation for increased burst velocity and rapid access to the aphotic zones near the water surface. Defence armour is well developed in clear lakes, independent of lake volume, and in large stained lakes. Completely plated populations are only found in clear habitats. Reduction in posterior plates is associated with accentuated armour development in the anterior trunk in large lakes where predatory vertebrates are common. Anterior armour, including lateral plates and spines, is progressively reduced towards an unarmoured condition in shallow, stained ponds.Conclusion: Threespine stickleback from pristine lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago demonstrate remarkable morphological differentiation among populations associated with habitat differences that is largely consistent with changes in predation regime, potentially mediated through a shift from post-capture to pursuit adaptations. Thus, even if founder effects occur when new populations are colonized, natural selection is a major determinant of morphological evolution.

In particular, the effects of multiple fish predators on food webs are difficult to predict due to the prevalence of omnivory and intra guild predation. At the same time, many ecosystems experience high nutrient loads that fuel food webs from the bottom up. To test the combined effects of both multiple predators and nutrient enrichment on food web composition, we created monocultures of perch, roach, and stickleback as well as mixed assemblages of all 3 species at 3 different density levels using an additive design, and induced nutrient en richment in half of the cages. The biomass of invertebrate herbivores and algae was measured. Stomach analyses of predators were used to detect prey switching. Herbivore biomass depended mainly on predator identity, while top-down effects on algae were mediated by predator density and nutrient en richment. Specifically, perch strongly reduced amphipods and isopods, and roach mainly reduced gastropods but also isopods, while stickleback had weak overall effects on herbivores. These species-specific effects were attenuated in the mixed fish assemblages, probably due to prey switching. Algal growth strongly increased under high fish density and nutrient enrichment, but was not affected by predator-induced changes in the herbivore composition. This study shows that identity effects from predators in isolation are attenuated in multiple predator assemblages, probably due to increasing interference among the predators. Algal biomass was enhanced by nutrient enrichment and high predator density, which affected algae probably through non-lethal effects, such as reduced activity of the herbivores.",10.3354/meps10622,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,Lake,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = prey selection,
"Remes, Vladimir",2006,Growth strategies of passerine birds are related to brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater),EVOLUTION,"Sibling competition was proposed as an important selective agent in the evolution of growth and development. Brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) intensifies sibling competition in the nests of its hosts by increasing host chick mortality and exposing them to a genetically unrelated nestmate. Intranest sibling competition for resources supplied by parents is size dependent. Thus, it should select for high development rates and short nestling periods, which would alleviate negative impacts of brood parasitic chicks on host young. I tested these predictions on 134 North American passerines by comparative analyses. After controlling for covariates and phylogeny, I showed that high parasitism rate was associated with higher nestling growth rate, lower mass at fledging, and shorter nestling periods. These effects were most pronounced in species in which sibling competition is most intense (i.e., weighing over about 30 g). When species were categorized as nonhosts versus old hosts (parasitized for thousands of years) versus new hosts (parasitized the last 100-200 years), there was a clear effect of this parasitism category on growth strategies. Nestling growth rate was the most evolutionarily flexible trait, followed by mass at fledging and nestling period duration. Adjustments during incubation (incubation period length, egg volume) were less pronounced and generally disappeared after controlling for phylogeny. I show that sibling competition caused by brood parasites can have strong effects on the evolution of host growth strategies and that the evolution of developmental traits can take place very rapidly. Human alteration of habitats causing spread of brood parasites to new areas thus cascades into affecting the evolution of life-history traits in host species.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The majority of general life-history models treat the environment as being invariable through time, even though temporal variation in selective agents could dramatically change the outcomes, e.g. in terms of optimal size and time at maturity. For herbivorous insects, seasonal differences in food quality are reasonably well described, but seasonal dynamics of top-down selective forces are poorly documented.2. The present study attempted to quantify seasonal changes in predation risk of folivorous insect larvae in temperate forest habitats. In a series of field experiments, artificial larvae were exposed to predators, and the resulting bird-inflicted damage was recorded. The trials were repeated regularly throughout the course of two summers.3. A distinct peak of larval mortality was recorded in mid-June (the nestling period for most insectivorous passerine birds), after which predation risk declined to a plateau of 20-30% below the peak value.4. The recorded pattern is interpreted as a consequence of seasonal changes in the number and behaviour of insectivorous birds, and the abundance of alternative food resources for these predators.5. A quantitative analysis based on field data indicated that considering temporal variation in mortality in life-history models is crucial for obtaining realistic predictions concerning central life-history traits, such as final body size in different generations.",10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01044.x,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Birds,Temperate Forest,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = prey selection,

Based on information obtained from analysis of thirteen taxonomic groups of plants and animals occurring in the alluvial floodplain habitats of the Upper Rhone River, France, we synthesize results obtained on: (i) relationships among species traits; (ii) habitat utilization by species; (iii) the relationship between species traits and habitat utilization; (iv) trends in species traits in a framework of spatial and temporal variability; and (v) tests of trends predicted for species traits and species richness in the framework of spatial and temporal habitat variability in terms of the river habitat templet and patch dynamics concept. 2. Species traits describing reproductive characteristics, food, and size had the closest relationships with each other in the various correspondence analyses performed. Faunal and floral separation by species traits produced groupings similar to those based on traditional taxonomy. 3. Two major gradients appear in the utilization of the floodplain habitats: a vertical gradient from interstitial to superficial habitats; and a transverse gradient from the main channel to oxbow lakes, temporary waters, and terrestrialized habitats. 4. For the majority of the groups examined, a statistically significant relationship was evident between the structure of the species trait and habitat utilization arrays. For these groups, the characteristics of the habitat act as a templet for species traits. Moreover, species trait modalities (i.e. categories defining traits) were significantly arranged along the axis of spatial and temporal variability for most groups, which indicates that such variability acts as a templet for species traits. 5. Species traits did not conform to predictions of the river habitat templet because the observed modality sequences did not follow the trends predicted in a framework of spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, there was no clear pattern in the distribution of species traits along an axis of temporal variability for groups of organisms having different sizes, which is a correlate of longevity, nor did modalities of species traits that occur under conditions of low temporal variability also tend to occur under conditions of high spatial variability (or vice versa). Clearly, species traits occur as alternative suites of characteristics in various groups of organisms. 6. The patch dynamics concept, which predicts that highest species richness occurs at intermediate levels of temporal variability and highest levels of spatial variability, was supported by observations in only two of the thirteen groups examined, and only partially (for spatial variability) when all 548 taxa were examined together. 7. The predictions of the river habitat templet and patch dynamics concepts were not supported, perhaps because templet theories do not yet accommodate alternative suites of characteristics and trade-offs between combinations of traits, or perhaps because the single scale of variability considered in the analyses, the inhomogeneity of the available biological information, and the aggregation of species traits that were used created methodological problems. 8. Ecologically sound river management policies eventually may be based on two key points that emerged from this synthesis: that the habitat acts as a templet for species traits, and that composite taxonomic groupings represent relatively homogeneous assemblages of species trait modalities. 9. The use of statistical approaches developed in this project to analyse other long-term data sets may clarify questions about the applicability of habitat templet theories to river ecology, and hasten development of ecologically sound river management policies.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb01756.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Broad,Broad,1,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = size, descendants per cycle, cycles per year, cycles per individual, reproductive technique, reproductive period, parental care, distance moved with current, distanced moved against current, attachment, body flexibility, body form, humidity tolerance, resistance stages, regeneration potential, insect adult longevity, general mobility, larval longevity, total longevity, food or feeding characteristics",

However, multivariate relationships among traits remain poorly characterized in animals. In this study, we aimed to identify the main multivariate trait dimensions that explain variance in important functional traits related to resource exploitation in ants. To this end, we created a large ant trait database. This database includes information on 11 traits that are important in ant resource exploitation; data were obtained for 150 European species found in different biomes. First, we examined the pairwise correlations between the traits included in the database. Second, we used multivariate analyses to identify potential trait dimensions. Our study shows that, to a great extent, resource exploitation strategies align along two main trait dimensions. The first dimension emerged in both the overall and group-specific analyses, where it accounted for the same pairwise trait correlations. The second dimension was more variable, as species were grouped by levels of taxonomy, habitat, and climate. These two dimensions included most of the significant pairwise trait correlations, thus highlighting that complementarity, but also redundancy, exists among different pairs of traits. The first dimension was associated with behavioral dominance: dominance was associated with large colony size, presence of multiple nests per colony, worker polymorphism, and a collective foraging strategy. The second dimension was associated with resource partitioning along dietary and microhabitat lines: it ranged from species that consume liquid foods, engage in group foraging, and mainly nest in the vegetation to species that consume insects and seeds, engage in individual foraging, and demonstrate strictly diurnal activity. Our findings establish a proficient ecological trait-based animal research that minimizes the number of traits to be measured while maximizing the number of relevant trait dimensions. Overall, resource exploitation in animals might be framed by behavioral dominance, foraging strategy, diet, and nesting habitat; the position of animal species within this trait space could provide relevant information about their distribution and abundance, for today as well as under future global change scenarios.",10.1890/14-2326.1.sm,Y,1,0,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Insects,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = worker size, worker polymorphism, colony size, diet, number of nests per colony, diurnality, nesting site, foraging strategy, behavioural dominance",

This unusual feature of human demography has been hypothesized to have evolved because of the ""grandmother'' effect, or the contributions that post-reproductive females make to the fitness of their children and grandchildren. While some correlative analyses of human populations support this hypothesis, few formal, experimental studies have addressed the evolution of post-reproductive lifespan. As part of an ongoing study of life history evolution in guppies, we compared lifespans of individual guppies derived from populations that differ in their extrinsic mortality rates. Some of these populations co-occur with predators that increase mortality rate, whereas other nearby populations above barrier waterfalls are relatively free from predation. Theory predicts that such differences in extrinsic mortality will select for differences in the age at maturity, allocation of resources to reproduction, and patterns of senescence, including reproductive declines. As part of our evaluation of these predictions, we quantified differences among populations in post-reproductive lifespan. We present here the first formal, comparative study of the evolution of post-reproductive lifespan as a component of the evolution of the entire life history.Guppies that evolved with predators and that experienced high extrinsic mortality mature at an earlier age but also have longer lifespans. We divided the lifespan into three non-overlapping components: birth to age at first reproduction, age at first reproduction to age at last reproduction ( reproductive lifespan), and age at last reproduction to age at death ( post-reproductive lifespan). Guppies from high-predation environments live longer because they have a longer reproductive lifespan, which is the component of the life history that can make a direct contribution to individual fitness. We found no differences among populations in post-reproductive lifespan, which is as predicted since there can be no contribution of this segment of the life history to an individual's fitness.Prior work on the evolution of post-reproductive lifespan has been dominated by speculation and correlative analyses. We show here that this component of the life history is accessible to formal study as part of experiments that quantify the different segments of an individual's life history. Populations of guppies subject to different mortality pressures from predation evolved differences in total lifespan, but not in post-reproductive lifespan. Rather than showing the direct effects of selection characterizing other life-history traits, post-reproductive lifespan in these fish appears to be a random add-on at the end of the life history. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in lifespan evolving in response to selection are confined to the reproductive lifespan, or those segments of the life history that make a direct contribution to fitness. We also show, for the first time, that fish can have reproductive senescence and extended post-reproductive lifespans despite the general observation that they are capable of producing new primary oocytes throughout their lives.",10.1371/journal.pbio.0040007,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Reznick, DN; Butler, MJ; Rodd, FH; Ross, P",1996,Life-history evolution in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) .6. Differential mortality as a mechanism for natural selection,EVOLUTION,"We have previously reported a correlation between the life-history patterns of guppies and the types of predators with which they coexist. Guppies from localities with an abundance of large predators (high predation localities) mature at an earlier age and devote more resources to reproduction than those found in localities with only a single, small species of predator (low predation localities). We also found that when guppies were introduced from a high to low predation locality, the guppy life history evolved to resemble what was normally found in this low predation locality. The presumed mechanism of natural selection is differences among localities in age/size-specific mortality (the age/size-specific mortality hypothesis); in high predation localities we assumed that guppies experienced high adult mortality rates while in the low predation localities we assumed that guppies experienced high juvenile mortality rates. These assumptions were based on stomach content analyses of wild-caught predators and on laboratory experiments. Here, we evaluate these assumptions by directly estimating the mortality rates of guppies in natural populations. We found that guppies from high predation localities experience significantly higher mortality rates than their counterparts from low predation localities, but that these higher mortality rates are uniformly distributed across all size classes, rather than being concentrated in the larger size classes. This result appears to contradict the predictions of the age/size-specific predation hypothesis. However, we argue, using additional data on growth rates and the probabilities of survival to maturity in each type of locality, that the age-specific mortality hypothesis remains plausible. This is because the probability of survival to first reproduction is very similar in each type of locality, but the guppies from high predation localities have a much lower probability of survival per unit time after maturity. We also argue for the plausibility of two other mechanisms of natural selection. These results thus reveal mortality patterns that provide a potential cause of natural selection, but expand, rather than narrow, the number of possible mechanisms responsible for life-history evolution in guppies.",10.2307/2410901,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = mortality rate,

As anthropogenic disturbances continue to alter species composition globally, there is a growing need to identify how species responses influence the establishment of distinct assemblages, such that management actions may be appropriately assigned. Here, we use trait-based analyses to compare temporal changes in five complementary indices of reef fish assemblage structure among six taxonomically distinct coral reef habitats exposed to a system-wide thermal stress event. Our results revealed increased taxonomic and functional similarity of previously distinct reef fish assemblages following mass coral bleaching, with changes characterized by subtle, but significant, shifts toward predominance of small-bodied, algal-farming habitat generalists. Furthermore, while the taxonomic or functional richness of fish assemblages did not change across all habitats, an increase in functional originality indicated an overall loss of functional redundancy. We also found that prebleaching coral composition better predicted changes in fish assemblage structure than the magnitude of coral loss. These results emphasize how measures of alpha diversity can mask important changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems as assemblages reorganize. Our findings also highlight the role of coral species composition in structuring communities and influencing the diversity of responses of reef fishes to disturbance.

A recently developed conceptual framework-the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution-predicts that local maladaptation should be common and largely determined by the interplay between gene flow and spatially variable reciprocal selection. Previous investigation of this theory has predominately focused on genetic systems of infection and resistance characterized by few genes of major effect and particular forms of epistasis. Here we extend existing theory by analyzing mathematical models of host-parasite interactions in which host resistance to parasites is mediated by quantitative traits with an additive polygenic basis. In contrast to previous theoretical studies predicated upon major gene mechanisms, we find that parasite local maladaptation is quite uncommon and restricted to one specific functional form of host resistance. Furthermore, our results show that local maladaptation should be rare or absent in studies that measure local adaptation using reciprocal transplant designs conducted in natural environments. Our results thus narrow the scope over which the predictions of the geographic mosaic theory are likely to hold and provide novel and readily testable predictions about when and where local maladaptation is expected.",10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00029.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

With the use of stable isotopes, new concepts have emerged based on the idea that the ecological niche can be approximated by the isotopic niche defined as a -space area with isotopic values as coordinates. This study aims to (i) redefine functional indices originally based on quantitative biological traits of species and demonstrate the ecological significance of newly defined isotopic functional indices (IFI) in a -isotopic space, (ii) compare IFI using biomass data with existing unweighted isotopic indices using only isotopic compositions. 2. Using a community-wide approach, we tested IFI using isotopic compositions of a large set of associated species from two marine benthic communities widely reported in coastal shallow waters: the common Amphiura filiformis muddy-sand community and the engineered Haploops nirae sandy-mud community. Biomass and isotopic composition (C-13 and N-15) of all species were measured during four seasons. 3. IFI were calculated in the isotopic space defined by the two communities, and variations were analysed: (i) isotopic functional richness indices measure the overall extent of the community trophic niche. They are higher in the Haploops community due to a higher diversity in food sources but also to longer food chains. (ii) isotopic functional evenness indices quantify the regularity in species distribution and the density in species packing. They showed that the biomass is concentrated at the edges of the food web in the Haploops community, outside the isotopic range of the main food source. (iii) isotopic functional divergence indices quantify the degree to which species distribution maximizes the divergence. They showed a larger utilization of secondary food sources in the Haploops community. 4.

Here, we assessed some morphological traits of marine fishes that could potentially be used as indicators for the ability to vary TROPH with body size. Stable isotope values of nitrogen were used as a proxy TROPH. The specific objectives were as follows: (a) to evaluate the relationship between the oral gape and the trophodynamic trend and (b) to quantify the relevance of 11 external morphological traits in determining the size-based trophodynamics. We used random forest models to identify the morphological traits that would help predict which species would have the potential to increase TROPH with growth and which would have not.

"Ripa, J",2009,When is sympatric speciation truly adaptive? An analysis of the joint evolution of resource utilization and assortative mating,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"The plausibility of sympatric speciation has long been debated among evolutionary ecologists. The process necessarily involves two key elements: the stable coexistence of at least two ecologically distinct types and the emergence of reproductive isolation. Recent theoretical studies within the theoretical framework of adaptive dynamics have shown how both these processes can be driven by natural selection. In the standard scenario, a population first evolves to an evolutionary branching point, next, disruptive selection promotes ecological diversification within the population, and, finally, the fitness disadvantage of intermediate types induces a selection pressure for assortative mating behaviour, which leads to reproductive isolation and full speciation. However, the full speciation process has been mostly studied through computer simulations and only analysed in part. Here I present a complete analysis of the whole speciation process by allowing for the simultaneous evolution of the branching ecological trait as well as a continuous trait controlling mating behaviour. I show how the joint evolution can be understood in terms of a gradient landscape, where the plausibility of different evolutionary paths can be evaluated graphically. I find sympatric speciation unlikely for scenarios with a continuous, unimodal, distribution of resources. Rather, ecological settings where the fitness inferiority of intermediate types is preserved during the ecological branching are more likely to provide opportunity for adaptive, sympatric speciation. Such scenarios include speciation due to predator avoidance or specialization on discrete resources.",10.1007/s10682-008-9267-z,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We used data from previously published studies to test for an association between sociality and brain size across 18 species (nine genera) of fungus-growing ants (Attini), which range from basal taxa with fewer than 100 monomorphic individuals, to derived colonies containing several million polymorphic, highly specialized individuals. Among monomorphic species, increased colony size was associated with decreased relative brain size and increased olfactory lobe size, although the latter result was sensitive to both the exclusion of potential outliers and whether phylogenetically independent contrasts were used. Within leafcutters (Atta), the relative size of the antennal lobes was also associated with group size, but may also reflect ecological foraging specialization, which may be a confounding variable. Comparisons between class-and individual-based societies highlight the general problem of increasing social structure in proportion to group size and show that there are alternative solutions to this problem: one alternative involves increasing behavioural specialization of individuals and evolved rules; the other involves increased diversification of individual behaviour, social norms and ultimately institutions.

The versatility of functional-trait-based approaches helps provide insight into many ecological processes in freshwater communities. We aim to provide baseline information on functional traits for tropical and subtropical Cladocera. Data on functional traits were gathered using published and unpublished data from Asia. The functional traits were chosen based on data availability and importance to the region's ecological conditions. Ten traits were chosen based on these criteria: two feeding, one reproductive, six survival, and one growth. Clustering of species showed possible unique and overlapping ecological roles and the impact of traits on the possible competition between and coexistence of species. Principal component analysis revealed tradeoffs between functional traits, where species that are heavily correlated with reproductive and growth traits do not usually have good survival traits and vice versa. These results can be used for further investigations on use of functional diversity and comparison of cladoceran communities, and provide additional insight into competition and coexistence within and structure of zooplankton communities across a wide range of ecological gradients.",10.1007/s10750-017-3199-y,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,Broad,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = feeding type, trophic regime, swimming antennae length ratio to body size, eye size to body size ratio, presence of ocellus, presence of color in the carapace, development of defensive structure, predator escape response, average egg clutch, mean body length ",

In this study, we analysed stream fish beta-diversity based on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic facets in an intensively cultivated tropical region. We sampled 43 stream reaches in the northwest of Sao Paulo State, south-eastern Brazil. Each sampling site was characterised according to catchment-scale features, landscape dynamic indicators, local-scale features, and distance between stream reaches as network distance (a proxy for dispersal processes). As response variables, we considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic beta-diversities coupled with a null-model approach. For each beta-diversity metric, we calculated the mean overall value and tested whether the mean value was different from that expected by chance. To examine variation in beta-diversity for the three facets and determine the relative contributions of predictor variables, we used a distance-based approach. Taxonomic and functional beta-diversities were higher from the expected value under a null model, suggesting that community assembly of these facets was dominated by deterministic processes. In contrast, phylogenetic beta-diversity was not different from that expected by chance, suggesting that the lineage composition of these assemblages was random. Furthermore, for all three facets, there was a positive environment-beta-diversity relationship that was determined primarily by local-scale features, whereas catchment features and landscape dynamic indicators were not important. In addition, none of the beta-diversity facets was correlated with stream network distance, indicating that dispersal processes were not strongly structuring fish assemblages. Our study suggested that although multiple facets of stream fish beta-diversity are ruled mainly by deterministic processes (e.g. species sorting), stochasticity is also important in community assembly. An interesting finding was the mismatch between phylogenetic versus taxonomic and functional beta-diversity. It is likely that the lack of non-random structure in phylogenetic beta-diversity is due to the variation of phylogenetic signal in some functional traits. Given that landscape dynamic indicators were not correlated with measures of beta-diversity, we suggest that the recent sugarcane expansion in our study area probably has not critically affected stream fish beta-diversity. Also, it is possible that catchment variables presented little variability and did not overwhelm the effect of local environmental variables on beta-diversity. In conclusion, our study suggests that even highly disturbed tropical agroecosystems with a pool of species that is probably decimated, can still display a relatively high beta-diversity determined mainly by species sorting. These findings suggest key environmental features that must be considered in restoration or conservation of beta-diversity in agroecosystems. Specifically, since variation in beta-diversity was explained mainly by local-scale environmental gradients, conservation schemes would ideally protect enough sites to capture this entire gradient.Overall, the knowledge of multiple facets can foment more effective conservation and restoration actions by providing a more comprehensive view of the structuring factors of assemblages.",10.1111/fwb.13233,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,Stream,1,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,0,1,"traits = compression index, relative area of pectoral fin, pectoral fin aspect ratio, relative eye position, relative dpeth, index of ventral flattening, fineness coeffcient, trophic guilds, size, substrate preference, adaptation to anoxic conditions",

The red-eyed tree frog, Agalychnis callidryas, is a widespread Neotropical frog that exhibits a broad range of polymorphism of coloration and flank-stripe pattern. The goal of this study was two-fold: first, to investigate the stability of polymorphisms over a 38-year period; and second, to evaluate biogeographical hypotheses of diversification between lower Central American populations through quantification of phenotypic diversity on a fine geographical scale. Location This study was conducted at 12 sites across four biogeographical regions in Costa Rica and Panama. Methods We quantified colour, categorized flank-stripe pattern from digital photos taken during field sampling, and measured body size for each individual. We compared the regional frequency of each flank-stripe pattern in 2005 with the frequency distribution from a previous study of the same sites in 1967 using logistic regression analyses. We determined the geographical signal of leg coloration by employing linear discriminant function analyses to generate a classification matrix based on covariance similarities, and by comparison of the average hue values within and between regions. Results We found a temporal shift in the frequency of flank-stripe patterns in three of four regions over 38 years. Based on measures of leg coloration, the frequency distribution of flank-stripe patterns and body size, we conclude that A. callidryas populations are easily distinguishable at a regional scale. Main conclusions Agalychnis callidryas exhibits regional differentiation in all phenotypic traits measured in this study, supporting the role of three major biogeographical barriers to gene exchange.

Recently, ecologists and biogeographers have recognized the need of analysing ecological communities in the light of multiple facets including not only species-level information but also functional and phylogenetic approaches to improve our understanding of the relative contribution of processes shaping biodiversity. Here, our aim was to disentangle the relative importance of environmental variables measured at multiple levels (i.e., local, catchment, climate, and spatial variables) influencing variation in macroinvertebrate beta diversity facets (i.e., species, traits, and phylogeny) and their components (i.e., replacement and abundance difference) in boreal streams. Taxon Location Aquatic macroinvertebrates Western Finland Methods Results A total of 105 streams were sampled in western Finland, encompassing a geographical extent over 500 km. We analysed variation in the different beta diversity facets and components using distance-based redundancy analysis and associated variation partitioning procedures. We modelled spatial structures using distance-based Moran eigenvector maps. We found that the relative influence of explanatory variables on each diversity facet and component revealed relatively similar patterns. Our main finding was that local environmental and spatial variables generally contributed most to the total explained variability in all facets and components of beta diversity, whereas catchment and climate variables explained less variation in the beta diversity facets at the spatial scale considered in this study.

"Rodil, IF; Compton, TJ; Lastra, M",2014,Geographic variation in sandy beach macrofauna community and functional traits,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"Sandy beaches are a common ocean-dominated ecosystem along the north coast of Spain. We conducted field surveys at 39 beaches distributed between 1 degrees and 9 degrees W, ca. 2000 km along this geographic region to document broad patterns of macrobenthic communities, and to describe their association with variables characterising both the beach environment and the characteristics of the adjacent ocean waters. Macrofaunal functional traits are considered to be an informative measure that can be useful for many ecosystem-level questions, as they are based on what organisms do (i.e., their ecological function) rather than on their identification alone. Boosted regression-trees analysis showed that the occurrence of the main taxonomic groups and feeding guilds were differentially associated with the prevailing beach features along this coastline. The occurrence (presence/absence) of molluscs was best explained by the concentration of chlorophyll-a and wave exposure whereas those of crustaceans and polychaetes were best explained by an ensemble of variables including beach slope, sea surface temperature and grain size. A comparison of the feeding guilds demonstrated that the occurrence of suspension feeders was best explained by chlorophyll-a and wave exposure, whereas the occurrence of deposit feeders was best explained by beach slope, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a. The occurrence of predators and scavengers was best explained by sea surface temperature and beach slope. Based on the patterns presented here, we confirm that the upwelling events that occur regularly on this coastline are a structuring agent for beach communities. Future work needs to examine the role of the oceanographic conditions of the region for they might represent the driving forces behind large-scale shifts in macrofauna communities.

"ROGERS, CM; SMITH, JNM",1993,LIFE-HISTORY THEORY IN THE NONBREEDING PERIOD - TRADE-OFFS IN AVIAN FAT RESERVES,ECOLOGY,"We tested the hypothesis of optimal winter fat storage in birds. The hypothesis predicts that when the survivorship benefits (fasting capacity) but not the survivorship costs (higher cost of flight, lowered agility, increased exposure to predators) of fat are eliminated by predictable resources (e.g., tree- and shrub-borne food), species will be leaner than species exploiting unpredictable resources (e.g., ground-borne food subject to sudden covering by snow). The predicted pattern was found in an earlier study of avian communities in central North America, where snowfall is frequent.Here we tested the predictions of the hypothesis that (1) when ground- and tree-feeding guilds are compared between geographic regions of harsh and mild winter climate, only ground-feeders will have relatively high fat reserves, resulting in a significant guild x climate interaction term in a two-way analysis of variance, and (2) ground- and tree-foraging guilds will both show low fat reserves in a mild winter environment. To test these predictions, visible subcutaneous fat class was measured in both guilds in Wisconsin and Michigan (harsh winter environments) and southwestern British Columbia, northwestern Washington, and Tennessee (mild winter environments). Both predictions were supported. We suggest that small birds wintering in North America approach local optima in energy storage strategy and winter survivorship. The energy storage strategy thus appears to be a major life-history trait in the nonbreeding period.The trade-off between the costs and benefits of winter fat has two potential implications for understanding population limitation. First, trade-offs that reduce reserves can lead to lower survival in severe winter weather than would occur at maximum fat levels. Second, our study suggests that individual birds are sensitive to, and can control, both predation and starvation risks. Recent theory of population limitation indicates that as food abundance declines, birds feed to avoid starvation, but at the expense of increased mortality from predation. Together these studies suggest that populations are limited by interacting (predation, food supply) instead of single (food supply) factors. Study of trade-offs used by individuals to maximize survival can provide unique perspectives on population limitation.",10.2307/1939303,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in which node makes links with which other node, whereas the centrality term quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers us a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics explain network architecture.

However, despite the detrimental consequences, it is also a unique opportunity to explore differences between invasive and resident species that may have led to the success of the invader. Using a functional morphology approach, we evaluated whether lionfish has novel traits and how they influenced the theoretical ecological space of some of the main small Caribbean reef predators. Additionally, we assessed if the native community generated biological resistance on the density of the invader. Lionfish and 12 native Caribbean small reef predators were used in this study. Thirteen characters were used to produce a morpho-functional space that defined the guild. A correlation was made between the total density of predators and that of lionfish. Morphological analyses indicated that the invasive species presents novel morphological traits, in comparison to native species. Additionally, the invader influences the reduction of the theoretical ecological space, suggesting competition with five Caribbean coral reef meso-predators. On the other hand, our data does not support the biological resistance hypothesis of native predators being the phenomenon that controls lionfish density.",unkown_21,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Marine,Fish,Coral Reef,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"triats = body shape (compilation of a bunch of morpho traits), mobility",

Based on concepts borrowed from natural selection theory, we propose that trait-competition relationships can generally correspond to three univariate selection modes: directional (a rectilinear relationship), stabilising (an n-shaped relationship), and disruptive (a u-shaped relationship). Moreover, correlational selection occurs when two traits interact in determining competitive ability and lead to an optimum trait combination (i.e., a bivariate nonlinear selection mode). We tested our ideas using two independent datasets, each one characterising a group of species according to (a) their competitive effect on a target species in a pot experiment and (b) species-level values of well-known functional traits extracted from existing databases. The first dataset comprised 10 annual plant species frequent in a summer-rainfall desert in Argentina, while the second consisted of 37 herbaceous species from cool temperate vegetation types in Canada. Both experiments had a replacement design where the identity of neighbours was manipulated holding total plant density in pots constant. We modelled the competitive ability of neighbours (i.e., the log inverse of target plant biomass) as a function of traits using normal multiple regression. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) was consistently subjected to negative directional selection in both experiments as well as to stabilising selection among temperate species. Leaf size was subjected to stabilising selection among desert species while among temperate species, leaf size underwent correlational selection in combination with specific leaf area (SLA): selection on SLA was negative directional for large-leaved species, while it was slightly positive for small-leaved species. Synthesis. Multiple quadratic regression adds functional flexibility to trait-based community ecology while providing a standardised basis for comparison among traits and environments. Our analyses of two datasets from contrasting environmental conditions indicate (a) that leaf dry matter content can capture an important component of plant competitive ability not accounted for by widely used competitive traits, such as specific leaf area, leaf size, and plant height and (b) that optimum relationships (either univariate or bivariate) between competitive ability and plant traits may be more common than previously realised.",unknown_22,Y,0,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = LDMC, leaf size, leaf size, plant height, specific root length",

Here, we integrate models of network structure and nonlinear population dynamics to search for potential generalities among trophic factors that may drive invasion success and failure. We simulate invasions where 100 different species attempt to invade 150 different food webs with 15-26 species and a wide range (0.06-0.32) of connectance. These simulations yield 11 438 invasion attempts by non-basal species, 47 per cent of which are successful. At the time of introduction, whether or not the invader is a generalist best predicts final invasion success; however, once the invader establishes itself, it is best distinguished from unsuccessful invaders by occupying a lower trophic position and being relatively invulnerable to predation. In general, variables that reflect the interaction between an invading species and its new community, such as generality and trophic position, best predict invasion success; however, for some trophic categories of invaders, fundamental species traits, such as having the centre of the feeding range low on the theoretical niche axis (for non-omnivorous and omnivorous herbivores), or the topology of the food web (for tertiary carnivores), best predict invasion success. Across all invasion scenarios, a discriminant analysis model predicted successful and failed invasions with 76.5 per cent accuracy for properties at the time of introduction or 100 per cent accuracy for properties at the time of establishment. More generally, our results suggest that tackling the challenge of predicting the properties of species and habitats that promote or inhibit invasions from food web perspective may aid ecologists in identifying rules that govern invasions in natural ecosystems.",10.1098/rstb.2008.0286,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,traits = trophic niche ,

The present study explores the allometry of mandibles and their supporting structure, the head, in males of the European stag beetle, Lucanus cervus. This species shows a remarkable dimorphism in mandible shape and size that are used by males in intraspecific combats. Stag beetles were captured, measured, weighed, and released in the framework of a capture-mark-recapture study. The relationship of mandible length (ML) and head width in respect to the overall body size was described by a segmented regression model. A linear relationship was detected between ML and head width. The scaling relationships for both ML and head width identified the same switchpoint, highlighting the advantages of using combined results of weapons and their supporting structures in such analysis. These results led to a more consistent distinction of males in two morphologies: minor and major. The survival probability of individuals was dependent on the morphological class and was higher for minor males than for major. Elytron length and body mass of the individuals did not show any significant variation during the season. Differences in predatory pressure were detected between morphs by the collection and analysis of body fragments due to the predatory activity of corvids. Morphological differences and shift in demographic and ecological parameters between the two classes suggested that selection continues to favor intrasexual dimorphism in this species throughout a trade-off mechanism between costs and benefits of carrying exaggerated traits.

"Rosado, BHP; de Mattos, EA",2017,On the relative importance of CSR ecological strategies and integrative traits to explain species dominance at local scales,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Identifying ecological strategies based on functional traits has been one of the main focuses of studies on plant community assembly. Recently, an important and timely tool, 'StrateFy', has been proposed for detecting plant strategies across the globe according to the CSR scheme. The CSR scheme is undeniably efficient across scales, and distinct CSR strategies among species have been proposed to explain differing degrees of dominance among species. However, in a previous study we showed that dominance ranking of woody species in a resource-poor habitat (coastal sandy plain) was not explained by morphological traits commonly measured in functional approaches (such as those used to estimate CSR strategies), but by integrative traits (i. e. traits that are the result of different combinations of functional traits) more related to plant performance. Here, we used CSR analysis and StrateFy on a dataset collected on a coastal sandy plain to test the hypothesis that the dominance ranking would be compatible with the CSR strategies; that is, that dominant species would show a greater proportion of the stress-tolerance strategy (S%) than subordinate species. Contrary to our hypothesis, all species exhibited an S/CS strategy, and the most dominant species had neither similar values nor the highest S%. The inability of CSR analysis (as applied using StrateFy) to predict dominance ranking suggests that it can explain relative dominance when different strategies co-occur, but not in cases where dominant and subordinate plants share the same strategy. We argue that the relative importance of CSR and integrative traits for describing dominance ranking may depend on how CSR strategies are filtered in each environment. In environments where only a narrow range of strategy classes are viable, integrative traits may be more important for explaining variation in degrees of dominance. Thus, the ability of a given species to achieve dominance may depend on integrative traits resulting from multiple trait arrays, not necessarily captured by the specific leaf area, leaf dry mass content and leaf area measurements that are used to calculate the relative proportions of strategies in StrateFy.",10.1111/1365-2435.12894,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Coastal Sandy Plain,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = CSR strategy, stress tolerance",

Functional trait composition had a larger predictive power for community biomass and measures of biodiversitity effects (40-82% of explained variation) than species richness per se (<1-13% of explained variation). CWM explained a larger amount of variation in community biomass (80%) and net biodiversity effects (70%) than FDQ (36 and 38% of explained variation respectively). FDQ explained similar proportions of variation in complementarity effects (24%, positive relationship) and selection effects (28%, negative relationship) as CWM (27% of explained variation for both complementarity and selection effects), but for all response variables the combination of CWM and FDQ led to significant model improvement compared to a separate consideration of different components of functional trait composition. Effects of FDQ were mainly attributable to diversity in nutrient acquisition and life-history strategies. The large spectrum of traits contributing to positive effects of CWM on biomass production and net biodiversity effects indicated that effects of dominant species were associated with different trait combinations.Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that the identification of relevant traits and the relative impacts of functional identity of dominant species and functional diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant diversity for ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass production.",10.1371/journal.pone.0036760,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,didn't link explicitly to environmental filtering,

The study was performed on Biceratium furca (Ehrenberg) Vanhoeffen, which is one of the most complex-shaped phytoplankton. Traditionally, biovolume is obtained from a standardized set of geometric models based on linear dimensions measured by light microscopy. However, especially in the case of complex-shaped cells, biovolume is affected by very large errors associated with the numerous manual measurements that this entails. We evaluate the accuracy of these traditional methods by comparing the results obtained using geometric models with direct biovolume measurement by image analysis. Our results show cell biovolume measurement based on decomposition into simple geometrical shapes can be highly inaccurate. Although we assume that the most accurate cell shape is obtained by 3D direct biovolume measurement, which is based on voxel counting, the intrinsic uncertainty of this method is explored and assessed. Finally, we implement a data-driven formula-based approach to the calculation of biovolume of this complex-shaped organism. On one hand, the model is obtained from 3D direct calculation. On the other hand, it is based on just two linear dimensions which can easily be measured by hand. This approach has already been used for investigating the complexities of morphology and for determining the 3D structure of cells. It could also represent a novel way to generalize scaling laws for biovolume calculation. Lay description MICROALGAE IN 3D - Phytoplankton are an extremely diverse, polyphyletic group of microscopic photosynthetic microalgae. They account for approximately half of Earth's primary productivity and differ in their edibility and nutritional value for higher trophic levels. Finally, many phytoplankton species can produce toxins that negatively affect water quality and higher levels of trophic food web. Phytoplankton cell shape and biovolume are commonly used as size descriptor in the study of phytoplankton ecology because of their potentiality to explain the organization of ecological communities and predict their reorganizations under global change. Traditionally, phytoplankton cell shape and biovolume is not measured directly but is obtained from a standardized set of geometric models based on linear dimensions measured by light microscopy. This commonly used method allows visualization and measurement in two dimensions (2D) yielding no information at all on the third dimension of phytoplankton cells. Inaccurate biovolume assessment resulting from geometric approximation leads to erroneous interpretation of eco-physiological processes and morpho-functional traits. Here, we propose a new method based on confocal microscopy coupled with an image analysis system (NIS Elements AR software, Nikon) to determine directly shape and biovolume by means 3D confocal images. We evaluate the accuracy of current methods by comparing the results obtained using geometric models with direct biovolume and shape.

However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.",10.3389/fevo.2018.00234,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Ross, Samuel R P-J; Friedman, Nicholas R; Janicki, Julia; Economo, Evan P",2019,A test of trophic and functional island biogeography theory with the avifauna of a continental archipelago.,The Journal of animal ecology,"The classical MacArthur-Wilson theory of island biogeography (TIB) emphasizes the role of island area and isolation in determining island biotas, but is neutral with respect to species differences that could affect community assembly and persistence. Recent extensions of island biogeography theory address how functional differences among species may lead to non-random community assembly processes and different diversity-area scaling patterns. First, the trophic TIB considers how diversity scaling varies across trophic position in a community, with species at higher trophic levels being most strongly influenced by island area. Second, further extensions have predicted how trait distributions, and hence functional diversity, should scale with area. Trait-based theory predicts richness-corrected functional diversity should be low on small islands but converge to null on larger islands. Conversely, competitive assembly predicts high diversity on small islands converging to null with increasing size. However, despite mounting interest in diversity-area relationships across different dimensions of diversity, these predictions derived from theory have not been extensively tested across taxa and island systems. Here, we develop and test predictions of the trophic TIB and extensions to functional traits, by examining the diversity-area relationship across multiple trophic ranks and dimensions of avian biodiversity in the Ryukyu archipelago of Japan. We find evidence for a positive species- and phylogenetic diversity-area relationship, but functional diversity was not strongly affected by island area. Counter to the Trophic TIB, we found no differences in the slopes of species-area relationships among trophic ranks, although slopes varied among trophic guilds at the same rank. We revealed differential assembly of trophic ranks, with evidence of trait-based assembly of intermediate predators but otherwise neutral community assembly. Our results suggest that niche space differs among trophic guilds of birds, but that differences are mostly not predicted by current extensions of island biogeography theory. Whilst predicted patterns do not fit the empirical data well in this case, the development of such theory provides a useful framework to analyse island patterns from new perspectives. The application of empirical datasets such as ours should help provide a basis for developing further iterations of island biogeography theory. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aims to identify the life-history traits most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this rain forest tree. 2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure. 3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (H-E = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (N-e = 21.6). 4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly. 5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances. 6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities.

In this paper, we used a hierarchical framework to examine relationships between phenotypic traits thought to constrain variation in per capita resource consumption rate. Physiological and behavioural traits were assumed to be important in mediating the control of morphology and sex on consumption. We conducted a longitudinal study aiming to relate the consumption rate of submerged leaf litter to sex, morphological, physiological and behavioural traits in an aquatic detritivore population. Then, we analysed the pattern of trait covariation using structural equation modelling (SEM). We observed broad and repeatable inter-individual variation in leaf consumption rate and other phenotypic traits. We found that expressing litter consumption rate relative to the time individuals spent feeding revealed and increased the effect of body mass and sex differences, respectively. Accordingly, SEM analyses showed that time allocated to resource acquisition mediated body mass and sex effects on apparent litter consumption rate whose variation was also accounted for by an indicator of activity-specific metabolic rate. Substantial variation in resource consumption rate was due to sex difference whereas body mass was of secondary importance. Individual phenotypic trait variations strongly altered consumer-resource relationships. Therefore, we encourage studies on consumers' intraspecific variability to advance knowledge about phenotypic determinants of individual resource consumption, an important link between individuals and ecosystems.",10.1111/oik.05228,Y,0,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Other,Temperate Forest,1,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits =  percentage of time (feeding, sheltering, moving),  apparent consomption rate, effective consumption rate, energy expenditure proxies, pleopod beat rate, locomotion velocity, velocity x movement RD, mandible thickness, mandicle incisor process curavture, bod mass ",

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can help forecast such range shift responses. For few species, both correlative and mechanistic SDMs were built, but allis shad (Alosa alosa), an endangered anadromous fish species, is one of them. The main purpose of this study was to provide a framework for joint analyses of correlative and mechanistic SDMs projections in order to strengthen conservation measures for species of conservation concern. Guidelines for joint representation and subsequent interpretation of models outputs were defined and applied. The present joint analysis was based on the novel mechanistic model GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics of Diadromous fish Distribution) which was parameterized on allis shad and then used to predict its future distribution along the European Atlantic coast under different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then used a correlative SDM for this species to forecast its distribution across the same geographic area and under the same climate change scenarios. First, projections from correlative and mechanistic models provided congruent trends in probability of habitat suitability and population dynamics. This agreement was preferentially interpreted as referring to the species vulnerability to climate change. Climate change could not be accordingly listed as a major threat for allis shad. The congruence in predicted range limits between SDMs projections was the next point of interest. The difference, when noticed, required to deepen our understanding of the niche modelled by each approach. In this respect, the relative position of the northern range limit between the two methods strongly suggested here that a key biological process related to intraspecific variability was potentially lacking in the mechanistic SDM.

Such a map would provide an important tool for mapping phenotypes and assembling the genome. Here we estimate the genome size of Daphnia magna and describe the construction of an SNP array based linkage map. We then test the suitability of the map for life history and behavioural trait mapping. The two parent genotypes used to produce the map derived from D. magna populations with and without fish predation, respectively and are therefore expected to show divergent behaviour and life-histories. Results: Using flow cytometry we estimated the genome size of D. magna to be about 238 mb. We developed an SNP array tailored to type SNPs in a D. magna F2 panel and used it to construct a D. magna linkage map, which included 1,324 informative markers. The map produced ten linkage groups ranging from 108.9 to 203.6 cM, with an average distance between markers of 1.13 cM and a total map length of 1,483.6 cM (Kosambi corrected). The physical length per cM is estimated to be 160 kb. Mapping infertility genes, life history traits and behavioural traits on this map revealed several significant QTL peaks and showed a complex pattern of underlying genetics, with different traits showing strongly different genetic architectures. Conclusions: The new linkage map of D. magna constructed here allowed us to characterize genetic differences among parent genotypes from populations with ecological differences. The QTL effect plots are partially consistent with our expectation of local adaptation under contrasting predation regimes. Furthermore, the new genetic map will be an important tool for the Daphnia research community and will contribute to the physical map of the D. magna genome project and the further mapping of phenotypic traits. The clones used to produce the linkage map are maintained in a stock collection and can be used for mapping QTLs of traits that show variance among the F2 clones.",10.1186/1471-2164-15-1033,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, climate fluctuations over geologic timescales have influenced species dispersal and extinction, which in turn may affect community structure. Modern community structure is likely to be the product of both palaeoclimate and modern climate, with the relative degrees of influence of past and present climates unknown. Here, we assessed the influence of climate at different time periods on the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of 203 African mammal communities. We found that the climate of the mid-Holocene (approx. 6000 years ago) and Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 22 000 years ago) were frequently better predictors of community structure than modern climate for mammals overall, carnivorans and ungulates. Primate communities were more strongly influenced by modern climate than palaeoclimate. Overall, community structure of African mammals appears to be related to the ecological flexibility of the groups considered here and the regions of continental Africa that they occupy.

However, substantial variation also exists in how far the ecological speciation process proceeds, potentially linked to the number of ecological axes, traits, or genes subject to divergent selection. In addition, recent studies highlight how differentiation might occur between the sexes, rather than between populations. We examine variation in trophic morphology in two host-plant ecotypes of walking-stick insects (Timema cristinae), known to have diverged in morphological traits related to crypsis and predator avoidance, and to have reached an intermediate point in the ecological speciation process. Here we test how host plant use, sex, and rearing environment affect variation in trophic morphology in this species using traditional multivariate, novel kernel density based and Bayesian morphometric analyses. Results: Contrary to expectations, we find limited host-associated divergence in mandible shape. Instead, the main predictor of shape variation is sex, with secondary roles of population of origin and rearing environment. Conclusion: Our results show that trophic morphology does not strongly contribute to host-adapted ecotype divergence in T. cristinae and that traits can respond to complex selection regimes by diverging along different intraspecific lines, thereby impeding progress toward speciation.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, the advantage conferred by dormancy might ultimately depend on other seed attributes, particularly size. This general model was tested within a phylogenetically informed framework using a data set comprising > 216 000 world-wide observations of Fabaceae, spanning three orders of magnitude in seed size and including both dormant and nondormant seeds.Our results confirmed our hypothesis: nondormant seeds can only evolve in climates with long growing seasons and/or in lineages that produce larger seeds. Conversely, dormancy should be evolutionarily stable in temperate lineages with small seeds. When the favorable season is fleeting, seed dormancy is the only adaptive strategy.Based on these results, we predict that, within a given lineage, taxa producing larger, nondormant seeds will necessarily predominate in aseasonal environments, while plants bearing small, dormant seeds will be dominant under short growing seasons.",10.1111/nph.14498,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = seed dormancy,
"Rudolf, VHW",2007,"Consequences of stage-structured predators: Cannibalism, behavioral effects, and trophic cascades",ECOLOGY,"Cannibalistic and asymmetrical behavioral interactions between stages are common within stage-structured predator populations. Such direct interactions between predator stages can result in density- and trait-mediated indirect interactions between a predator and its prey. A set of structured predator-prey models is used to explore how such indirect interactions affect the dynamics and structure of communities. Analyses of the separate and combined effects of stage-structured cannibalism and behavior-mediated avoidance of cannibals under different ecological scenarios show that both cannibalism and behavioral avoidance of cannibalism can result in short- and long-term positive indirect connections between predator stages and the prey, including ""apparent mutualism."" These positive interactions alter the strength of trophic cascades such that the system's dynamics are determined by the interaction between bottom-up and top-down effects. Contrary to the expectation of simpler models, enrichment increases both predator and prey abundance in systems with cannibalism or behavioral avoidance of cannibalism. The effect of behavioral avoidance of cannibalism, however, depends on how strongly it affects the maturation rate of the predator. Behavioral interactions between predator stages reduce the short-term positive effect of cannibalism on the prey density, but can enhance its positive long-term effects. Both interaction types reduce the destabilizing effect of enrichment. These results suggest that inconsistencies between data and simple models can be resolved by accounting for stage-structured interactions within and among species.",10.1890/07-0179.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The soil ecological research group at the Staatliches Museum fur Naturkunde, Karlsruhe have investigated the soil fauna at 11 selected forest sites within this programme with the specific objective of establishing a system of soil quality classification based on biological criteria. These sites represent different climatic and pedological regions as well as different levels of adverse environmental impact. Results relating to the incidence of predatory mesostigmatid mites in the study sites are reported here. Our methodology begins by ranking mesostigmatid mite taxa according to their life-history traits on an r/K-scale. A faunal maturity index, which expresses the proportion of species in a community with predominantly K attributes to those with more r attributes, can then be calculated for the fauna of any particular site. The less environmentally perturbed a soil is, the higher the value of this index. Comparative norms for the index in different forest types can be deduced by analysing published species lists from unperturbed sites. The index is a sensitive bioindication tool and a more integrative measure of the severity of environmental impact in forest ecosystems than is the more traditional measurement of heavy metal concentrations in soil Litter and earthworm tissues.

However, in ephemeral habitats this heuristic framework remains largely untested. Although temporary wetland faunas are constrained by a local filter (i.e., desiccation), we propose its magnitude may still depend on large-scale climate characteristics. If this is true, climate should be related to the degree of functional and taxonomic relatedness of invertebrate communities inhabiting seasonal wetlands. We tested this hypothesis in two ways. First, based on 52 biological traits for invertebrates, we conducted a case study to explore functional trends among temperate seasonal wetlands differing in the harshness (i.e., dryness) of their dry season. After finding evidence of trait filtering, we addressed whether it could be generalized across a broader climatic scale. To this end, a meta-analysis (225 seasonal wetlands spread across broad climatic categories: Arid, Temperate, and Cold) allowed us to identify whether an equivalent climate-dependent pattern of trait richness was consistent between the Nearctic and the Western Palearctic. Functional overlap of invertebrates increased from mild (i.e., Temperate) to harsher climates (i.e., Arid and Cold), and phylogenetic clustering (using taxonomy as a surrogate) was highest in Arid and lowest in Temperate wetlands. We show that, (i) as has been described in streams, higher relatedness than would be expected by chance is generally observed in seasonal wetland invertebrate communities; and (ii) this relatedness is not constant but climate-dependent, with the climate under which a given seasonal wetland is located determining the functional overlap and the phylogenetic clustering of the community.

Predicting the relationships between global change and native faunas requires a quantitative toolkit that effectively links the timing and magnitude of extreme events to variation in species abundances. Here, we examine how discharge anomalies - unexpected floods and droughts - determine covariation in abundance of native and non-native fish species in a highly variable desert river in Arizona. We quantified stochastic variation in discharge using Fourier analyses on >15000 daily observations. We subsequently coupled maximum annual spectral anomalies with a 15-year time series of fish abundances (1994-2008), using Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space (MARSS) models. Abiotic drivers (discharge anomalies) were paramount in determining long-term fish abundances, whereas biotic drivers (species interactions) played only a secondary role. As predicted, anomalous droughts reduced the abundances of native species, while floods increased them. However, in contrast to previous studies, we observed that the non-native assemblage was surprisingly unresponsive to extreme events. Biological trait analyses showed that functional uniqueness was higher in native than in non-native fishes. We also found that discharge anomalies influenced diversity patterns at the meta-community level, with nestedness increasing after anomalous droughts due to the differential impairment of native species. Overall, our results advance the notion that discharge variation is key in determining community trajectories in the long term, predicting the persistence of native fauna even in the face of invasion. We suggest this variation, rather than biotic interactions, may commonly underlie covariation between native and non-native faunas, especially in highly variable environments. If droughts become increasingly severe due to climate change, and floods increasingly muted due to regulation, fish assemblages in desert rivers may become taxonomically and functionally impoverished and dominated by non-native taxa.",10.1111/gcb.12780,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,"traits = water column position, prey, max length, longevity, max reported fecundity, spawning method, length of spawning season, salinity tolerance, substrate preference, water flow preference, elevation of habitat, ",

The ecological causes driving divergence in insular populations are, however, poorly understood. Reduced predator fauna is expected to lower escape propensity, increase body size and relax selection for crypsis in small-bodied, insular prey species. Here, we investigated whether escape behaviour, body size and dorsal coloration have diverged as predicted under predation release in spatially replicated islet and mainland populations of the lizard species Podarcis gaigeae. We show that islet lizards escape approaching observers at shorter distances and are larger than mainland lizards. Additionally, we found evidence for larger between-population variation in body size among the islet populations than mainland populations. Moreover, islet populations are significantly more divergent in dorsal coloration and match their respective habitats poorer than mainland lizards. These results strongly suggest that predation release on islets has driven population divergence in phenotypic and behavioural traits and that selective release has affected both trait means and variances.

We surveyed three species-rich genera (Limnanthes, Mimulus and Clarkia) with centres of diversity in the Sierra Nevada of California. Each genus contains species that co-flower and share pollinators, and each has a robust phylogeny. Within each genus, we surveyed 44-48 communities at three spatial scales, measured floral and vegetative traits and tested for segregation or aggregation of: (i) species, (ii) floral traits (which are likely to be influenced by pollinators), and (iii) vegetative traits (which are likely affected by other environmental factors). We detected both aggregation and segregation of floral traits that were uncorrelated with vegetative trait patterns; we infer that pollinators have shaped the community assembly although the mechanisms may be varied (competition, facilitation, or filtering).

Traditional methods can reveal correlated phylogenies between interacting organisms, suggesting a co-evolutionary association. However, several processes could lead to cophylogeny, including (1) vicariance, (2) phylogenetic tracking and (3) co-evolution. We present a framework to investigate diffuse co-evolution between groups of interacting taxa. Our methodology incorporates two complementary statistical methods to test for evolutionary signals. First, we test for correlated taxonomies between interacting species, and then we test for an association between the pattern of interactions and taxonomy of interacting species. We use these methods to clearly distinguish between three possible explanations of cophylogenies, when present. Our methodology is designed to explore diffuse evolutionary signals among many interacting taxa: it is robust to polytomies and generalization and can use taxonomic trees in place of phylogenies. Thus, we use taxonomic distances to identify groups of associated taxa, as opposed to specific co-evolutionary relationships. In a case study, we find significant evidence for phylogenetic tracking, vicariance and asymmetry. Generally, our method can be applied whenever relevant taxonomy is well resolved and includes sufficient variation at multiple taxonomic ranks between two groups of interacting taxa. This adaptable method can incorporate many types of data on species traits or behaviours, such as phylogenetic relatedness, pollination efficacy, interaction strengths and visitation rates.

Several hypotheses for preference evolution invoke different processes but all can produce the same end results: thus comparisons of extant traits and preferences within and among populations have made little progress in discriminating among competing hypotheses. Some of these hypotheses, however, do make different predictions as to the historical sequence of trait-preference evolution, and thus can be discriminated with appropriate phylogenetic analyses. We explore this approach in an analysis of the evolution of calls and call preferences in a monophyletic group of frogs, the Physalaemus pustulosus species group. In this clade there are pre-existing preferences for four call traits. These data reject hypotheses that invoke coevolution (good genes, runaway sexual selection) and females evolving preferences to choose males providing better resources, and instead support the hypothesis of sensory exploitation that suggests that males evolve traits that match pre-existing biases in the female's sensory system.We suggest that some of the difficulty in understanding preference evolution might derive from defining a preference only by those extant stimuli that elicit the preference. Our results suggest that preferences might be more general, and that signal diversity might arise from alternative means for eliciting the same preference. Furthermore, we discuss some difficulties with utilizing both population-based comparisons and phylogenetic approaches and suggest that the greatest progress will be made by addressing the problem of preference evolution at several levels of analysis.",10.1098/rstb.1993.0057,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The most critical assumptions are that: 1) habitat structure matters, but spatial configuration does not; and 2) local dynamics of prey and predator are deterministic, fully determined by the first colonization and always end in prey extinction after a single oscillation, followed by predator dispersal. The ""baseline"" model predicts multiple stable states, either with or without predators, when there are many patches that harbor only few prey. Stable predator-prey cycles surface, however, when the number of patches is low and can harbor many prey. Virtually all acarine predator-prey metapopulation experiments published to date have been done under the latter conditions and show metapopulation-level cycles that are either periodic with large amplitudes or aperiodic with small amplitudes. Simulations suggest the large amplitude cycles arise when survival in the dispersal phase is low, whereas the small amplitude cycles surface when survival in the dispersal phase is relatively higher, yet low enough to allow persistence of predators and prey at the metapopulation level. The ""baseline"" model is further analyzed to detect which factors cause persistence or extinction at the metapopulation level. Persistence was promoted by prey dispersal from predator-occupied patches, time spent by prey in the dispersal phase, interception of predators in predator-occupied patches, and heterogeneous colonization risks among patches. Extinction is promoted by predator dispersal after extermination of prey in a patch and time spent by predators in the dispersal phase. The relative importance of all of these factors is yet to be determined. Moreover, the relevance of spatial patterning of predator-prey interactions is much debated. Model-based simulations to analyze an experimentally established time series suggest that what matters to persistence is reduced discovery of prey patches, not the spatial configuration per se. However, the last word has not been said about this, since spatial predator-prey models suggest configuration to play an important role.The ""baseline"" model is not evolutionary robust, in that its structure arises from individual traits that are not favored by natural selection. It is based on the assumption that first colonization is the single determinant of local predator or prey dynamics and that predator dispersal is delayed until after prey extermination. Delayed predator dispersal cannot evolve, however, when only the initial colonization of prey-only patches by a predator is taken into account. It also does not evolve in simulations with a model, parameterized for the acarine predator-prey system, in which not only the first colonization but also subsequent invasions are taken into account. However, observations on the behavior of field-collected predators show that delayed dispersal is the rule rather than the exception. We argue that delayed predator dispersal prevails in the field because local populations are subject to catastrophes which give predators little control over the exploitation of their local prey population. Hence, natural selection in the field will favor predators that exploit the local prey population as fast as possible and delay dispersal until after prey extermination.The important lesson to be drawn from this review is that the insights came from comparing a suite of models that all differed in key assumptions from a comprehensive yet formal ""baseline"" model and from testing these models against laboratory experiments. Understanding the complex dynamics observed in acarine predator-prey metapopulations requires more than spotting an arbitrary caricatural model with a dynamic behavior that corresponds qualitatively to that of the biological system.",10.1016/S0065-2504(04)37006-6,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In their role as the major food source to marine grazers, diatoms supply carbon, nutrients and energy to the Southern Ocean food web. Prevailing environmental conditions influence diatom phenotypic traits (for example, photophysiology, macromolecular composition and morphology), which in turn affect the transfer of energy, carbon and nutrients to grazers and higher trophic levels, as well as oceanic biogeochemical cycles. The paucity of phenotypic data on Southern Ocean phytoplankton limits our understanding of the ecosystem and how it may respond to future environmental change. Here we used a novel approach to create a 'snapshot' of cell phenotype. Using mass spectrometry, we measured nitrogen (a proxy for protein), total carbon and carbon-13 enrichment (carbon productivity), then used this data to build spectroscopy-based predictive models. The models were used to provide phenotypic data for samples from a third sample set. Importantly, this approach enabled the first ever rate determination of carbon productivity from a single time point, circumventing the need for time-series measurements. This study showed that Chaetoceros simplex was less productive and had lower protein and carbon content during short-term periods of high salinity. Applying this new phenomics approach to natural phytoplankton samples could provide valuable insight into understanding phytoplankton productivity and function in the marine system.",10.1038/ismej.2015.123,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Saito, VS; Cianciaruso, MV; Siqueira, T; Fonseca-Gessner, AA; Pavoine, S",2016,Phylogenies and traits provide distinct insights about the historical and contemporary assembly of aquatic insect communities,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The assumption that traits and phylogenies can be used as proxies of species niche has faced criticisms. Evidence suggested that phylogenic relatedness is a weak proxy of trait similarity. Moreover, different processes can select different traits, giving opposing signals in null model analyses. To circumvent these criticisms, we separated traits of stream insects based on the concept of alpha and beta niches, which should give clues about assembling pressures expected to act independently of each other. We investigated the congruence between the phylogenetic structure and trait structure of communities using all available traits and all possible combinations of traits (4095 combinations). To account for hierarchical assembling processes, we analyzed patterns on two spatial scales with three pools of genera. Beta niche traits selected a priori - i.e., traits related to environmental variation (e.g., respiration type) - were consistently clustered on the smaller scale, suggesting environmental filtering, while a niche traits i. e., traits related to resource use (e.g., trophic position) - did not display the expected overdispersion, suggesting a weak role of competition. Using all traits together provided random patterns and the analysis of all possible combinations of traits provided scenarios ranging from strong clustering to overdispersion. Communities were phylogenetically overdispersed, a pattern previously interpreted as phylogenetic limiting similarity. However, our results likely reflect the co-occurrence of ancient clades due to the stability of stream habitats along the evolutionary scale. We advise ecologists to avoid using combinations of all available traits but rather carefully traits based on the objective under consideration. Both trait and phylogenetic approaches should be kept in the ecologist toolbox, but phylogenetic distances should not be used as proxies of traits differences. Although the phylogenetic structure revealed processes operating at the evolutionary scale, only specific traits explained local processes operating in our communities.",10.1002/ece3.2081,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Insects,Stream,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = BMWP index (biological monitoring working party), respiration, Reophily, microhabitat preferences",

A reduction in the range of strategies enabling organisms to survive in a given environment and changes in the average trait values of species may potentially be associated with variations in species' number and identity. We investigated the variation in ant taxonomic composition and morphological trait diversity along a land-use gradient in French Guiana. We measured 13 core ant morphological traits on all species sampled. We then selected the set of five traits that best captured changes along the land-use gradient. Potential effects of the variation in morphological trait diversity and average values were evaluated by examining morphological traits individually as well as in combination. We found that variation in taxonomic diversity was unrelated to the plot-level morphospace. Conversely, a significant shift in taxonomic composition was accompanied by changes in the average values of community traits along the studied gradient, examined both individually and in combination. We argue that morphological trait values may be related to the success of different species in surviving in a given environment and, therefore, are indicative of the taxonomic turnover in ants along the land-use gradient. Nevertheless, in contradiction with theoretical expectations, the morphospace is only slightly affected by habitat filtering and loosely impacted by taxonomic changes.

However, relatively little is known about homeothermic animals' ability to adapt to changing temperature regimes through changes in body size, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We used fluctuations in mean annual temperatures in south-west Germany since 1972 in order to look for direct links between temperature and two aspects of body size: body mass and flight feather length. Data from regionally born juveniles of 12 passerine bird species were analysed. Body mass and feather length varied significantly among years in eight and nine species, respectively. Typically the inter-annual changes in morphology were complexly non-linear, as was inter-annual variation in temperature. For six (body mass) and seven species (feather length), these inter-annual fluctuations were significantly correlated with temperature fluctuations. However, negative correlations consistent with Bergmann's rule were only found for five species, either for body mass or feather length. In several of the species for which body mass and feather length was significantly associated with temperature, morphological responses were better predicted by temperature data that were smoothed across multiple years than by the actual mean breeding season temperatures of the year of birth. This was found in five species for body mass and three species for feather length.

Schedules of survival, growth and reproduction are key life-history traits. Data on how these traits vary among species and populations are fundamental to our understanding of the ecological conditions that have shaped plant evolution. Because these demographic schedules determine population growth or decline, such data help us understand how different biomes shape plant ecology, how plant populations and communities respond to global change and how to develop successful management tools for endangered or invasive species. 2. Matrix population models summarize the life cycle components of survival, growth and reproduction, while explicitly acknowledging heterogeneity among classes of individuals in the population. Matrix models have comparable structures, and their emergent measures of population dynamics, such as population growth rate or mean life expectancy, have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among populations and species. 3. Thousands of plant matrix population models have been parameterized from empirical data, but they are largely dispersed through peer-reviewed and grey literature, and thus remain inaccessible for synthetic analysis.

Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and life-history traits. To explore this vast variation, functional ecologists and population ecologists have developed independent approaches that identify the mechanisms behind and consequences of trait variation. 2. Collaborative research between researchers using trait-based and demographic approaches remains scarce. We argue that this is a missed opportunity, as the strengths of both approaches could help boost the research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology. 3. This special feature, which spans three journals of the British Ecological Society due to its interdisciplinary nature, showcases state-of-the-art research applying trait-based and demographic approaches to examine relationships between organismal function, life history strategies and population performance across multiple kingdoms. Examples include the exploration of how functional trait x environment interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages between microbial functional traits and the fast-slow continuum. 4. Despite their historical isolation, collaborative work between functional ecologists and population ecologists could unlock novel research pathways. We call for an integrative research agenda to evaluate which and when traits are functional, as well as their ability to describe and predict life history strategies and population dynamics. We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome current limitations. These include a more explicit linkage of selection gradients in the context of functional trait-vital rate relationships, and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals, thus allowing for the explicit incorporation of trade-offs in analyses of covariation of functional traits and life-history traits.",10.1111/1365-2435.13148,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Implications for stream food webs,PLOS ONE,"Little is known regarding consequences of climate change on riparian plant functional types (PFTs) related to leaf traits, with putative domino effects on stream food webs, plausible even if the tipping point of stream-desiccation is not reached. We hypothesized that, as stream food-webs are highly dependent on riparian subsidies, climate change might alter PFTs to the point of weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages. We conducted a gradient analysis to assess the relative effects of climate, soil and riparian physical characteristics on PFTs. If PFTs differ significantly in leaf traits and climate had major influences on them, we could assume space-for-time interchangeability forward in time to predict leaf traits changes, and consequences for stream food webs under future climate change scenarios. Results indicated a clear distinction in leaf traits among PFTs: woody deciduous plants showed leaf traits associated to high decomposability and nutritional value for invertebrate shredders compared to evergreen woody and giant graminoid groups. We found a prime role of climate predicting changes in abundance and diversity of PFTs: 1) a warming and precipitation-decline scenario, coupled with soil characteristics related to aridification, would have detrimental effects on deciduous plants, while fostering giant graminoids; 2) in a scenario of no precipitation-reduction in wetter areas, warming might promote the expansion of evergreen to the detriment of deciduous plants.

We analyzed patterns of relationships between species, species trait distribution/assembly, and environmental variables from the west of Europe to Slovakia, Poland and Sweden. We created a database by compiling traits and occurrence data of European collembolan species, using literature and personal field studies embracing a large range of environmental gradients (vertical stratification, habitat closure, humus form, soil acidity and moisture, temperature, rainfall, altitude) over which Collembola are supposed to be distributed. Occurrences of the 58 best-documented species, environmental variables and species traits allowed us to (i) show which environmental variables impact the distribution of the 58 species at broad scale and (ii) document to what extent environmental variables and species trait assemblages are related and which trends could be found in trait/environment relationships. The impact of vertical stratification, habitat closure, humus form, soil acidity, soil moisture, temperature, and to a lesser extent rainfall and altitude on species distribution, firstly revealed by indirect gradient analysis (correspondence analysis, CA), was further shown to be significant by direct gradient analysis (canonical correspondence analysis, CCA). RLQ analyses were performed to find linear combination of variables of table R (environmental variables) and linear combinations of the variables of table Q (species traits) of maximum covariance weighted by species occurrence data contained in table L. RLQ followed by permutation tests showed that all tested environmental variables apparently contributed significantly to the assemblages of the twelve species traits studied. A convergence was observed between traits related to vertical stratification and those related to habitat closure/aperture. Well-developed locomotory organs (furcula, legs), presence of sensorial organs sensitive to air movements and light (e.g. trichobothria and eye spots), spherical body, large body size, pigmentation (UV protection and signaling) and sexual reproduction largely occur in epigeic and open habitats, while most of woodland and edaphic habitats are characterized by short locomotory appendages, small body size, high number of defense organs (pseudocelli), presence of post-antennal organs and parthenogenesis. Climate and especially temperature exert an effect on the assemblage of traits that are mostly present above-ground and in open habitats. The contribution of combinations of some environmental variables to the occurrence of each species trait was tested by linear, logistic or multinomial regression (Generalized Linear Models). Vertical stratification, followed by temperature, played a dominant role in the variation of the twelve studied traits. Relationships between traits and environment tested here shows that it is possible to use some traits as proxies to identify potential ecological preferences or tolerances of invertebrate species. However, a significant part of species distribution remained unexplained, probably partly because some traits, like ecophysiological ones, or traits involved in biotic interactions (e.g. competition) were unavailable. The present work is thus a first step towards the creation of models predicting changes in collembolan communities. Further studies are required to inform ecophysiological traits, in order to complete such models. Moreover the niche width of species will have to be determined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that, overall, disturbed populations of the three major taxa are more tolerant of human disturbance than less disturbed populations.

We aimed to study metacommunity structure of spiders, a group that is known for high dispersal power, local niche partitioning and for engaging in species interactions. While living in fragmented habitats could lead to nestedness, other ecological traits of spiders might equally lead to patterns dominated either by species interactions or habitat filtering. We asked, which community pattern will prevail in a typical agricultural landscape with isolated patches of semi-natural habitats. Such a situation was studied by sampling spiders in 28 grassland locations in a Hungarian agricultural landscape. We used the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to distinguish between alternative patterns that reveal community organization. The EMS analysis indicated coherent species ranges, high turnover and boundary clumping, suggesting Clementsian community organization. The greatest variation in species composition was explained by local habitat characteristics, indicating habitat filtering. The influence of dispersal could be detected by the significant effect of landscape composition, which was strongest at 500 m. We conclude that dispersal allows spiders to respond coherently to the environment, creating similar communities in similar habitats. Consistent habitat differences, such as species rich versus species poor vegetation, lead to recognisably different, recurrent communities. These characteristics make spiders a predictable and diverse source of natural enemies in agricultural landscapes. Sensitivity to habitat composition at medium distances warns us that landscape homogenization may alter these metacommunity processes. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

In generalist predators, which feed on a wide range of prey, the size and position of the trophic niche is likely determined by traits such as hunting mode, the stratum they occur in, their body size and age. We used stable isotope analyses (C-13 and N-15) to measure the trophic niche size of nine spider species within a forest hedge community and tested for species traits and individual traits that influence stable isotope enrichment, niche size and resource use. The spiders Enoplognatha, Philodromus, Floronia, and Heliophanus had large isotopic niches, which correspond to a more generalistic feeding behaviour. In contrast, Araneus, Metellina and Agelena, as top predators in the system, had rather narrow niches. We found a negative correlation between trophic position and niche size. Differences in trophic position in spiders were explained by body size, hunting modes and stratum, while niche size was influenced by hunting mode. In Philodromus, the size of the trophic niche increased significantly with age. Fitting spiders to functional groups according to their mean body size, hunting mode and their habitat domain resulted in largely separated niches, which indicates that these traits are meaningful for separating functional entities in spiders. Functional groups based on habitat domain (stratum) caught the essential functional differences between the species with species higher up in the vegetation feeding on flying insects and herb and ground species also preying on forest floor decomposers. Interestingly, we found a gradient from large species using a higher habitat domain and having a smaller niche to smaller species foraging closer to the ground and having a larger niche.

Seabirds constitute a diverse group of marine top predators which have relatively low fecundity and high annual survival rates. In order to predict effects of climate change, it is a necessary precondition to first understand responses to naturally occurring climatic fluctuations. While the ecological effects of different large-scale climatic phenomena have received much attention in the recent past, the factors determining the responses of seabirds are still little understood. We analyze more than a hundred previously published time series of seabird offspring production and adult survival rates in the North Atlantic in order to detect climatic signals in this data base. As our analyses are phylogenetic-comparative, we are able to search for patterns across species. Using the correlation of these parameters with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as a measure of responsiveness to climatic variability, we find that effects of climate on either parameters considered are not more common than expected by chance. The magnitudes of the responsivenesses were entirely randomly distributed throughout the seabird phylogeny, but were not strongly related to the explanatory variables considered.

Using capture-mark-resighting data, we modelled the annual survival rates of five species of seabirds, the common guillemot (Uria aalge), Brunnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), razorbill (Alca torda), Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). The data spanned 14 years of observation at a colony on Hornoya, off Northern Norway in the western Barents Sea.3. A method of taking into account ring-loss of marked individuals is proposed. This approach made it possible to keep many observations which otherwise would have to be discarded.4. The estimated survival rates were higher and less variable than most estimates for the same species from other colonies. There was extensive resighting heterogeneity. Ignoring this effect would have underestimated breeding life span by more than 50% in some species.5. The analysis presented is the first study to document a correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and adult survival in North Atlantic seabirds. Other environmental variables considered were sea surface temperatures (SST) and prey stocks. In most of the species, models incorporating climatological variables were considerably better supported than models with constant survival, time-dependent survival or prey effects. SSTs tended to explain more of the variability in seabird survival than did the NAO.6. The importance of prey availability was evident in some of the species, but climate was generally a better predictor of survival. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that meteorological parameters affect seabird mortality only indirectly, possibly through the food chain. This conclusion rests on the observations that most NAO effects are lagged, and that survival rates decreased with increasing SSTs.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00981.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,not really dealing with env filtering,

These approaches allow for comparisons between water bodies with different species composition. We hypothesize that similar changes in environmental conditions lead to similar responses with regard to functional traits of phytoplankton communities, regardless of trophic state or species composition. We studied the phytoplankton (species composition, community trait mean and diversity) of five reservoirs in Brazil along a trophic gradient from ultra-oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic. Samples at two seasons (summer/rainy and winter/dry) with a horizontal and vertical resolution were taken. Using multivariate analysis, the five reservoirs separated, despite some overlap, according to their environmental variables (mainly total phosphorus, conductivity, pH, chlorophyll a). However, between the seasonal periods, the reservoirs shifted in a similar direction in the multi-dimensional space. The seasonal response of the overall phytoplankton community trait mean differed between the ultra-oligotrophic and the other reservoirs, with three reservoirs exhibiting a very similar community trait mean despite considerable differences in species composition. Within-season differences between different water layers were low. The functional diversity was also unrelated to the trophic state of the reservoirs. Thus, seasonal environmental changes had strong influence on the functional characteristics of the phytoplankton community in reservoirs with distinct trophic condition and species composition.

Functional groups including nuisance species were more abundant in the heavily disturbed estuary. During a dry season, results for both systems were similar.

In both systems, diatoms were dominant (> 75% of the community), however, the group included small and larger individuals, and freshwater to cosmopolitan species.

Differences in body size between the sexes might reflect selective pressures and trade-offs to optimize performance. Here, we analyze the size dimorphism of the Galdpagos Dove (Zenaida galapagoensis) using principal component and discriminant analyses with samples obtained from six islands: Santiago, Santa Fe, Santa Cruz, Espanola, Genovesa, and Wolf. We also reanalyze published morphological data but also including additional samples from Wolf Island to account for morphological differences among islands.

Discriminant analyses correctly classified 98% of males and 100% of females, and cross-validation of the model correctly classified 97% of males and 98% of females. We created two sexual size dimorphism indices using wing chord and tarsus as body-size surrogates. Significant differences were found in the sexual size dimorphism index for both measurements among islands. Significant differences in Sexual size dimorphism among islands might indicate the role of different selective pressures acting on individual islands (e.g., competition, predation, resources, sexual selection), which might result in life history variation of the species among islands.

We introduce an approach that addresses this challenge, coupling a trait-based analysis with spatial population modelling to project spread rates for 15000 virtual mammals with life histories that reflect those seen in the real world. Covariances among life-historytraits are estimated from an extensive terrestrial mammal data set using Bayesian inference. We elucidate the relative roles of different life-history traits in driving modelled spread rates, demonstrating that any one alone will be a poor predictor. We also estimate that around 30% of mammal species have potential spread rates slower than the global mean velocity of climate change.

"Santoandre, Santiago; Filloy, Julieta; Zurita, Gustavo A.; Isabel Bellocq, M.",2019,Ant taxonomic and functional diversity show differential response to plantation age in two contrasting biomes,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"The increasing global demand for lumber and pulp has led to the conversion of natural habitats into monocultures of fast-growing tree plantations. The environmental filtering model proposes that both environmental characteristics of anthropogenic habitats and biotic interactions act as a filter that can be passed through by some species of the regional pool, driving the formation of local assemblages. Therefore, environmental filtering promotes the selective loss of species and convergence of functional traits, resulting in assemblages of species that are functionally more similar than expected by chance. In Argentina, pine monocultures have expanded in both subtropical forest and grassland biomes. Typically, environmental similarity between plantations and natural habitat decreases in the grassland and increases in the subtropical forest with increasing plantation age (time since pine stands were planted). Then, we predict that changes in biological diversity with plantation age will be opposite when plantations develop in environmentally contrasting biomes. To test the prediction, we studied taxonomic (species richness) and functional (based in morphological functional traits) diversity of epigeal ant assemblages in pine plantations of different ages (from 1 to 12 years old), developing in contrasting biomes that determined different contexts of the main natural (i.e., native) habitat: subtropical forest and grassland. Temperature, humidity and vegetation cover were recorded, and ants were collected using pitfall traps. For plantations and natural habitats of both biomes, we estimated functional diversity in sets of randomized communities and compared them with the observed functional diversity throughout plantation age. As expected, results showed opposite environmental similarity gradients between natural habitats and plantation ages. In the subtropical forest, ant species richness remained similar but functional diversity increased with increasing plantation age, associated with the presence of predatory ants. In the grassland, species richness showed a maximum at intermediate ages, but functional diversity remained similar with increasing plantation age. Null model analyses showed lower functional diversity than expected by chance in young plantations developing in the subtropical forest and at all ages in grassland, indicating convergence of functional traits. Our findings support environmental filtering as the primary mechanism driving the formation of ant assemblages along pine plantation cycle. To our best knowledge, this is the first study analysing patterns of diversity along tree plantation cycles developing in contrasting biomes.

The origin of aposematism is puzzling, because of its predicted low probability of establishment in a population due to the prey's increased conspicuousness. Aposematism is a widespread trait in invertebrate taxa, but, in vertebrates, it is mostly evident in amphibians, reptiles, and fishes. Poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are one of the most well known examples of the co-occurrence of warning coloration and toxicity. This monophyletic group of mostly diurnal leaf-litter Neotropical anurans has both toxic/colorful and palatable/cryptic species. Previous studies suggested a single origin of toxicity and warning coloration, dividing the family in two discrete groups of primitively cryptic and more derived aposematic frogs. Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses using mostly aposematic taxa supported this conclusion and proposed a single tandem origin of toxicity and conspicuous warning coloration. By using expanded taxon and character sampling, we reexamined the phylogenetic correlation between the origins of toxicity and warning coloration. At least four or five independent origins of aposematism have occurred within poison frogs; by using simulations, we rejected hypotheses of one, two, or three origins of aposematism (P < 0.002). We also found that diet specialization is linked with the evolution of aposematism.

"Santos, Juan C.",2012,Fast Molecular Evolution Associated with High Active Metabolic Rates in Poison Frogs,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Molecular evolution is simultaneously paced by mutation rate, genetic drift, and natural selection. Life history traits also affect the speed of accumulation of nucleotide changes. For instance, small body size, rapid generation time, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and high resting metabolic rate (RMR) are suggested to be associated with faster rates of molecular evolution. However, phylogenetic correlation analyses failed to support a relationship between RMR and molecular evolution in ectotherms. In addition, RMR might underestimate the metabolic budget (e.g., digestion, reproduction, or escaping predation). An alternative is to test other metabolic rates, such as active metabolic rate (AMR), and their association with molecular evolution. Here, I present comparative analyses of the associations between life history traits (i.e., AMR, RMR, body mass, and fecundity) with rates of molecular evolution of and mitochondrial loci from a large ectotherm clade, the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). My results support a strong positive association between mass-specific AMR and rates of molecular evolution for both mitochondrial and nuclear loci. In addition, I found weaker and genome-specific covariates such as body mass and fecundity for mitochondrial and nuclear loci, respectively. No direct association was found between mass-specific RMR and rates of molecular evolution. Thus, I provide a mechanistic hypothesis of the link between AMRs and the rate of molecular evolution based on an increase in ROS within germ line cells during periodic bouts of hypoxia/hyperoxia related to aerobic exercise. Finally, I propose a multifactorial model that includes AMR as a predictor of the rate of molecular evolution in ectothermic lineages.",10.1093/molbev/mss069,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Among snakes, ambush predation and dietary specialisation are factors that increase this vulnerability. European viper species, genus Vipera, display such traits and are categorised as endangered in several parts of its range. For their conservation management, a deeper knowledge of their ecology and habitat use is highly relevant. One of the species with less ecological data is the Lataste's viper Vipera latastei, a species which lives in the Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Africa. Here, we describe its diet based on the analysis of gut content of 435 museum specimens plus nine bibliographic data from the entire Iberian range. The species showed seasonal and ontogenctic shift in diet but no sexual variations. Feeding activity (percentage of vipers with prey) was low in accordance with its ambush predation tactics, being lower in spring than in summer and autumn. Prey spectrum included two main (reptiles and small mammals), and three sporadic, types of prey (arthropods, amphibians and birds). The consumption of reptiles and mammals was seasonal; the former decreased in occurrence from spring to autumn, whereas the latter showed an opposite pattern. There was an ontogenetic shift in the diet: juveniles fed mainly on reptiles and arthropods, whereas adult vipers progressively substitute this prey with insectivores, and the largest vipers primarily foraged on rodents and birds. Our results suggest that the seasonal variation in prey type was related to prey availability, whereas the ontogenetic shift was linked to gape limitation. The apparently wide prey spectrum of V latastei must therefore be examined, taking into account that there are seasonal and ontogenetic dietary variations as well as geographic differences, the latter probably driven by climatic contrasts into the Iberian Peninsula. This new data of the endangered Iberian V latastei can aid the effective conservation management of this species.",10.1163/157075607780001998,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Thus, combining phylogenetic and trait-based information can be a powerful approach for understanding community assembly processes across a range of spatial scales. We used this approach to investigate tree community composition at Phou Khao Khouay National Park (18 degrees 14'-18 degrees 32'N; 102 degrees 38'-102 degrees 59' E), Laos, where several distinct forest types occur in close proximity. The aim of our study was to examine patterns of plant community assembly across the strong environmental gradients evident at our site. We hypothesized that differences in tree community composition were being driven by an underlying gradient in soil conditions. Thus, we predicted that environmental filtering would predominate at the site and that the filtering would be strongest on sandier soil with low pH, as these are the conditions least favorable to plant growth. We surveyed eleven 0.25 ha (50x50 m) plots for all trees above 10 cm dbh (1221 individual trees, including 47 families, 70 genera and 123 species) and sampled soils in each plot. For each species in the community, we measured 11 commonly studied plant functional traits covering both the leaf and wood economic spectrum traits and we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree for 115 of the species in the community using rbcL and matK sequences downloaded from Genebank (other species were not available). Finally we compared the distribution of trait values and species at two scales (among plots and 10x10m subplots) to examine trait and phylogenetic community structures. Although there was strong evidence that an underlying soil gradient was determining patterns of species composition at the site, our results did not support the hypothesis that the environmental filtering dominated community assembly processes. For the measured plant functional traits there was no consistent pattern of trait dispersion across the site, either when traits were considered individually or when combined in a multivariate analysis. However, there was a significant correlation between the degree of phylogenetic dispersion and the first principle component axis (PCA1) for the soil parameters. Moreover, the more phylogenetically clustered plots were on sandier soils with lower pH. Hence, we suggest that the community assembly processes across our sitemay reflect the influence of more conserved traits that we did not measure. Nevertheless, our results are equivocal and other interpretations are possible.

We analyzed the niche specialization of several Tanypodinae taxa (predatory non-biting midge, 4th instar, n=693) along the depth zones of the water in six shallow tropical reservoirs. We measured the body length and diet composition of seven Tanypodinae larvae genus. Community-weighted mean (CWM) traits index was utilized to calculate the niche distribution of body length and diet composition. We analyzed the niche distribution of predator larvae, through a simple linear analysis of CWM index and the depth of the water, and by establishing correlations between body length and diet composition. In our study, it was found that the consumption of oligochaete (b=0.30, SE +/- 0.04, t=7.02, p=0.0001, R-2=0.45) and the body length (b=0.64, SE +/- 0.11, t=5.44, p=0.0001, R-2=0.33) increased in deeper zones. We observed a strong and positive relationship between oligochaete consumption and a longer body (r=0.91, p=0.0001). We inferred that changes in habitat characteristics, from littoral to deeper zones of the reservoirs, are expected to have influenced the selection of larvae traits predators.

An unresolved question is how best to represent and reconstruct evolution of these complex traits at coarse spatial scales through time. Studies have approached this question by integrating phylogenetic comparative methods with niche estimates inferred from correlative and other models. However, methods for estimating niches often produce incomplete characterizations, as they are inferred from present-day distributions that may be limited in full expression of the fundamental ecological niche by biotic interactions, dispersal limitations, and the existing set of environmental conditions. Here, we test whether incomplete niche characterizations inherent in most estimates of species' niches bias phylogenetic reconstructions of niche evolution, using simulations of virtual species with known niches. Results establish that incompletely characterized niches inflate estimates of evolutionary change and lead to error in ancestral state reconstructions. Our analyses also provide a potential mechanism to explain the frequent observation that maximum thermal tolerances are more conserved than minimum thermal tolerances: populations and species experience more spatial variation in minimum temperature than in maximum temperature across their distributions and, consequently, may experience stronger diversifying selection for cold tolerance.",10.1093/sysbio/syx084,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We present a comparative analysis based on a 30-year breeding survey of two related migratory songbird species [Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus (RW) and Great Reed Warbler A. arundinaceus (GRW)], which coexist in reedbeds by means of various interspecific interactions. The RW advanced breeding by 15 days and shortened its breeding time window, which is a combined effect of higher temperatures, alleviated competition as a consequence of population declines in the dominant GRW, and reduced RW population. Although the breeding period of GRW changed only slightly, its clutch initiation was likewise related to temperature. Most probably, advanced breeding in RW is favoured by changes in food supply and accelerated reed growth, which provides the necessary nest concealment earlier, whereas this does not affect the GRW, a species less vulnerable to nest predation. Clutch size decreased later in the season, so that earlier breeding produced a net increase in both species. An additional increase of clutch size in GRW can be explained by the use of higher-quality territories in today's smaller population. The main causes of nest losses were predation in RW and adverse weather in GRW, but reproductive success increased over the study period in both species, which was a consequence of larger clutches in RW, but of favourable weather during rearing and fewer total losses in GRW. Our results document that different causal mechanisms are involved in the reproductive changes of the two congeneric species living in the same habitat: RW breeding earlier by making use of competitive release and other ecological improvements, and GRW by benefiting from better rearing conditions.

Additionally, this study tests whether patterns of assembly vary with plot biomass and moisture using both presence-absence and abundance-weighted analyses (two plot sizes: 25 x 25 cm, 75 x 75 cm). Plant species in these grasslands were randomly organized with respect to both maximum and minimum species height; however, coexisting plant species had a significantly smaller mean seed mass than expected by chance, and were significantly convergent in seed mass, consistent with observations from one previous study, and with theory related to environmental or competitive filtering. These patterns were consistent across plot sizes, and were similar whether analyses were abundance-weighted or not, although partitioned analyses show that these patterns are most pronounced in wet grasslands. Grasslands were non-randomly assembled with respect to five of our ten traits including seed mass, fruit type, CGO, branching type and leaf distribution. Among these, only patterns of branching type clearly conformed to the predictions from Limiting Similarity Theory, suggesting that variation in this trait may contribute to species coexistence in these grasslands. In two cases (fruit type, branching type), results differed in significance depending on whether analysis used presence-absence or abundance data; incorporating abundance may be more relevant, however, cover-based abundance measures in small plots can bias trait representation in favour of size over ramet number. In general, patterns were consistent across the two plot sizes. For four traits (seed mass, flowering phenology, leaf distribution and lateral spread) plot-level effect sizes of our tests varied significantly with plot-level biomass production; the slope of these relationships was positive for seed mass, but negative for flowering phenology, leaf distribution and lateral spread. For seven of ten traits, plot-level effect sizes varied significantly with plot-level soil moisture, with positive regression slopes for some traits (flowering phenology, leaf distribution), and negative slopes for others (minimum height, seed mass, fruit type, pollen vector, CGO).

In freshwater fish, divergent body shapes within single species have been repeatedly observed along the littoral-pelagic axes of lakes, where the structural complexity of near shore habitats provides a more diverse set of resources compared to the open-water zones. It remains poorly understood whether similar resource-driven polymorphism occurs among lakes that vary in structural complexity and predation pressure, and whether this variation is heritable. Here, we analyzed body shape in four populations of omnivorous roach (Rutilus rutilus) inhabiting shallow lakes. We tested the relationship between body shape, gradients of resources, predation pressure, and, in a subset of two lakes, diet composition. We used genome scans of 331 polymorphic AFLP markers to test whether there was a heritable component to the observed morphological diversification. Results: Body shape differed among lakes and was significantly correlated to differences in predation pressure. Roach from the lake with highest predation pressure were most divergent from the average body shape of all populations, characterized by a more streamlined body and caudally inserted dorsal fins; features that facilitate predator escape. Surprisingly, diet composition was not associated with morphology. AFLP analysis revealed weak genetic differentiation among lakes and no isolation by distance (IBD). Outlier analysis detected three loci under positive selection with differing frequencies in the four populations. General linear models did not support an association of lake-specific genotypes with morphological variation. Conclusion: Body shape was divergent among lakes, suggesting that processes previously reported from within single lakes may also be operating at the scale of whole lakes. We found no evidence for body shape being heritable, although sample size was small in these natural populations. Rather than habitat structure and diet, we conclude that predation had a stronger effect on the prevalence of local morphotypes.

This approach shares substantial similarity to the now widely used double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing-based method (ddRADseq), except that it utilizes a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. This method therefore identifies changes in the genomic methylation state of cytosine (to 5-methylcytosine; 5mC) by sampling loci (via next-generation sequencing) that are not methylated within a sample. We test this method to identify shifts in the epigenome of clonal water fleas (Daphnia ambigua) in response to exposure to fish predator cues, which are known to induce transgenerational changes in life-history traits. 3. We found evidence for differential transgenerational responses (inferred via significant shifts in the methylation state of sampled loci) to predator cues among our treatment groups and remarkably consistent responses within treatment groups. Our results demonstrate that this method is capable of producing highly repeatable results even without the use of a reference genome. 4. Applications of this general method are broad and diverse and include the analysis of epigenetic shifts in both experimental and natural study systems.",10.1111/2041-210X.12435,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.",10.1890/03-0408,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,no traits,

"Schleicher, Andrea; Peppler-Lisbach, Cord; Kleyer, Michael",2011,Functional traits during succession: is plant community assembly trait-driven?,PRESLIA,"Little is known about changes in the significance of environmental filtering and neutral processes during the succession of plant communities. Generally, a succession is expected to be trait-driven and a shift is predicted from high importance of seed dispersal ability in initial phases to importance of strong competitive ability in later stages. In this study, we consider a community assembly trait-driven in the case of a shift in functional traits during succession and randomly assembled in the case there is no shift in functional traits during succession. We therefore tested whether urban plant communities show trait convergence or trait divergence in relation of successional stage, water and nutrient availability. At two scales (100 x 100 cm and 10 x 10 cm), we analysed traits relevant to seed dispersal, stress tolerance and competitive ability and compared real data with null models. We subsequently used regression trees to associate convergence and divergence to plot age and stress due to low water and soil nutrient availability. Most traits were neither significantly convergent nor divergent and the variance explained by the regression trees was often lower than 20%. We found divergence in seed number instead of the expected convergence towards high seed number. In accord with expectations we found low seed terminal velocity and annual life span in early succession. Convergence in seed bank longevity occurred at intermediate plot age, and convergence in the combination of life span and lateral spread showed the relevance of competition filtering in the most fertile plots. On the other hand, competition-induced convergence in canopy height or specific leaf area was not supported by our results. We concluded that, based on the traits considered in this study, the overwhelming evidence was that community assembly during the first 40 years of succession was driven by trait-neutral mechanisms.",unkown_25,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Urban ,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = seed dispersal, stress tolerance, competitive ability",

An empirical test of the network position hypothesis using multiple taxa,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Quantifying the relative importance of how local (environmental or niche-based) and regional (dispersal-related or spatial) processes regulate the assembly of communities has become one of the main research avenues of community ecology. It has been shown that the degree of isolation of local habitats in the landscape may substantially influence the relative role of environmental filtering and dispersal-related processes in metacommunities. 2. Dendritic stream networks are unique habitats in the landscape, where more isolated upstream sites have been predicted to be primarily structured by environmental variables, while more central mainstem rivers by both environmental and spatial variables (hereafter the network position hypothesis, NPH). However, the NPH has almost exclusively been tested for stream macroinvertebrates, and therefore its predictions warrant confirmation from multiple taxa. 3. We examined the validity of the NPH for benthic diatoms, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish in the Pannon Ecoregion, Hungary. Following the NPH we predicted a clear dominance of environmental over spatial variables in headwaters, and a larger effect of spatial variables in rivers compared to headwaters. We tested these predictions using variance partitioning analyses separately for the different taxa in headwater and in riverine habitats. 4. We found large differences in the explained community variance when the impact of environmental (physical and chemical) and spatial (overland and watercourse distance) variables for various taxa was studied. In general, total explained variance was lower for the more passively dispersing plant taxa than for animal taxa with more active dispersal in both streams and rivers. However, similar to other studies, the total explained variance was low for both headwater streams and rivers. 5. Community structure of diatoms could be best explained by both environmental and spatial variables in streams, whereas their community structure could not be explained by either variable group in rivers. The significance of environmental and spatial variables depended on the distance measure (overland versus watercourse) in the case of macrophytes. Community structure of macroinvertebrates could be explained by environmental variables in streams and by both environmental and spatial variables in rivers. Moreover, variation was explained by different predictors when macroinvertebrate taxa were divided into flying and non-flying groups, suggesting the importance of dispersal mode in explaining community variation. Finally, community structure of fishes could be explained by both environmental and spatial variables in streams and only by environmental variables in rivers. 6. In conclusion, we found no clear evidence of the NPH in our multi-taxa comparison. For example, while patterns in macroinvertebrate communities seem to support the NPH, those in fish communities run counter with the predictions of the NPH. This study thus shows that different taxa may behave differently to isolation effects in stream networks. We discuss alternatives in the interpretation of dispersal (or spatial) effects which may partly explain differences in the observed patterns from the NPH, and emphasise the need for further studies in unravelling the importance of isolation in stream metacommunity structuring.",10.1111/fwb.12973,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

While they addressed an important issue in stream ecology, here we present an opposite view. To identify the causes of these contrasting opinions, we carefully examined the examples provided by Monaghan and Soares (2014) and demonstrated how traits can be weighted by the presence, abundance and log-transformed abundance of the taxa in a meaningful way. We found that Monaghan and Soares (2014), following other authors, use the term weighting' differently from classical papers of stream ecology. The general practice is to calculate the sum of trait values multiplied by the abundance of each taxon and divide it by the total invertebrate abundance to get a community-level trait value. In contrast, Monaghan and Soares (2014) did not perform the final division and consequently did not get a standardised community-level trait value. It follows that the term weighting' is used with different meanings in stream ecology, and ecologists should keep these differences in mind. We agree with Monaghan and Soares (2014) that the addition of log-transformed data is equivalent to multiplication on an arithmetic scale. However, we disagree that this provides an inconsistent scaling that confounds quantitative analyses.

Traditionally, the abiotic habitat template is regarded as the major determinant of its organization, and only a limited number of studies support the importance of biotic interactions. The aim of the present study was to examine whether competition plays a significant role in organizing the shredder guild of caddisflies in a riffle. Null-model based co-occurrence, co-existence and guild variation analyses were used in the study of guild organization. In addition, the traditional variance to mean ratio was applied for measuring the intraspeclific aggregation of guild members. The non-significant metric values of co-occurrence and co-existence analyses predicted that competition was of limited importance in structuring the spatial organization of the shredder guild. The observed aggregated spatial distribution of species, suggests that besides stochastic events, deterministic forces should also contribute to the organization of the shredder guild of caddistlies.

Building on predictions from functional trait models of fish feeding, we analyzed foraging experiments with a Bayesian path analysis and elucidated the traits explaining variation in foraging performance and the species composition of ingested prey. Despite extensive previous research on the divergence of foraging traits among populations and ecotypes of stickleback, our results provide novel experimental evidence of trait utility for jaw protrusion, gill raker length, and gill raker spacing when foraging on a natural zooplankton assemblage. Furthermore, we discuss how these traits might contribute to the differential effects of lake and stream stickleback on their prey communities, observed in both laboratory and mesocosm conditions.

In particular, host species resilient to changes in their natural habitat may increase in numbers, which in turn can affect the prevalence of directly transmitted viruses. We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapes differing in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama and investigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus prevalence. The modification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitat patches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity and species assemblages, which was further associated with shifts in the abundance of generalist marsupial (Didelphis marsupialis, Philander opossum) and rodent (Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolated habitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus host in our study system. Our analyses suggest that, in addition to the effects of host age and sex, host population density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor of infection probability. Although we found no significant relationships between species diversity per se and infection probability, the lowest prevalence detected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates that shifts in species assemblages (e.g. changes in the presence and abundance of marsupial predators) impact the host's intraspecific contact rates, the probability of virus transmission and, thus, the virus prevalence. Our study additionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and, therefore, on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitant consideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors.",10.1007/s00442-018-4210-7,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Parthenogens were found everywhere including the littoral, whereas sexuals were restricted to the centre. We investigated the hypothesis that spatial distribution responded to ecological differences. We studied the ecological significance of this segregation by linking environmental data to male presence, sexual fraction, ploidy, and genetic structure of our model organism in 12 ponds in the lake basin. Hydro-chemical and biological data indicated that the observed segregation is not only spatial but also ecological, with sexual E. virens occurring in ponds with shorter and probably more unpredictable hydroperiod. The correlations between environmental gradients and E. virens population structure suggest that sexual and parthenogenetic lineages are ecologically segregated. Sexual populations appeared restricted to sufficiently unpredictable environments, while parthenogens dominated environments with longer hydroperiods.

We investigated the relative influence of these two deterministic filters on the trophic structure of animalivorous bat assemblages in South Africa. We used null models to test if patterns of dietary overlap were significantly different from patterns expected by chance and multivariate analyses to test the correlations between diet and phenotype (body size, wing morphology and echolocation). We found little evidence that competition structured the trophic niche of coexisting bats. Contrary to predictions from competition, dietary overlap between bats of ensembles and functional groups (open-air, clutter-edge, and clutter foragers) were significantly higher than expected by chance. Instead, we found support for the predictions of the allotonic frequency hypothesis: there were significant relationships between peak echolocation frequency and the proportion of moths in the diets of bats at local and regional scales, and peak echolocation frequency was the best predictor of diet even after we controlled for the influence of body size and phylogeny. These results suggest that echolocation frequency and prey hearing exert more influence on the trophic structure of sympatric animalivorous bats than competition.

We apply our methods to a simple juvenile-adult model with stochastic variation in reproduction and an illustrative example with published data for the perennial herb, Calathea ovandensis. These examples buttressed by additional analysis reveal that increased variability in vital rates simultaneously slow down invasions yet generate greater uncertainty about rates of spatial spread.

We prove that coevolutionarily stable prey and searching predators prefer patches that in isolation support higher prey and searching predator densities, respectively. Using this fact, we determine how environmental variation and predator handling times influence the spatial patterns of patch preferences, population abundances and per-capita predation rates. In particular, long predator handling times are shown to result in the coevolution of predator and prey aggregation.

Traits are powerful predictors of ecosystem functions pointing to underlying physiological and ecological processes. Plant individual performance results from the coordinated operation of many processes, ranging from nutrient uptake over organ turnover to photosynthesis, thus requiring a large set of traits for its prediction. For plant performance on higher hierarchical levels, e.g. populations, additional traits important for plant-plant and trophic interactions may be required which should even enlarge the spectrum of relevant predictor traits.2. The goal of this study was to assess the importance of plant functional traits to predict individual and population performance of grassland species with particular focus on the significance of root traits. We tested this for 59 grassland species using 35 traits divided into three trait clusters: leaf traits (16), stature traits (8) and root traits (11), using individual biomass of mesocosm plants as a measure of individual performance and population biomass of monocultures as a measure of population performance. We applied structural equation models to disentangle direct effects of single traits on population biomass and indirect effects via individual plant biomass or shoot density. We tested multivariate trait effects on individual and population biomass to analyse whether the importance of different trait clusters shifts with increasing hierarchical integration from individuals to populations.3. Traits of all three clusters significantly correlated with individual and population biomass. However, in spite of a number of significant correlations, above-below-ground linkages were generally weak, with few exceptions like N content.4. Stature traits exclusively affected population biomass indirectly via their effect on individual biomass, whereas root and leaf traits showed also direct effects and partly indirect effects via density.5. The inclusion of root traits in multiple regression models improved the prediction of individual biomass when compared with models with only above-ground information only slightly (95% vs. 93% of variance prediction with and without root traits, respectively) but was crucial for the prediction of population biomass (77% and 49%, respectively). Root traits were more important for plant performance than leaf traits and were even the most important predictors at the population level6. Synthesis. Upscaling from the individual to the population level reflects an increasing number of processes requiring traits from different trait clusters for their prediction. Our results emphasize the importance of root traits for trait-based studies especially at higher organizational levels.

Diffusion, which approximates a correlated random walk, has been used by ecologists to describe movement, and forms the basis for many theoretical models. However, it is often criticized as too simple a model to describe animal movement in real populations. 2. We test a key prediction of diffusion models, namely, that animals should be more abundant in land cover classes through which they move more slowly. This relationship between density and diffusion has rarely been tested across multiple species within a given landscape. 3. We estimated diffusion rates and corresponding densities of 25 Israeli butterfly species from flight path data and visual surveys. The data were collected across 19 sites in heterogeneous landscapes with four land cover classes: semi-natural habitat, olive groves, wheat fields and field margins. 4. As expected from theory, species tended to have higher densities in land cover classes through which they moved more slowly and lower densities in land cover classes through which they moved more quickly. Two components of movement (move length and turning angle) were not associated with density, nor was expected net squared displacement. Move time, however, was associated with density, and animals spent more time per move step in areas with higher density. 5. The broad association we document between movement behaviour and density suggests that diffusion is a good first approximation of movement in butterflies. Moreover, our analyses demonstrate that dispersal is not a species-invariant trait, but rather one that depends on landscape context. Thus, land cover classes with high diffusion rates are likely to have low densities and be effective conduits for movement.",10.1111/1365-2656.12609,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Schuwirth, N; Dietzel, A; Reichert, P",2016,The importance of biotic interactions for the prediction of macroinvertebrate communities under multiple stressors,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"1. The community assembly of macroinvertebrates in streams depends on the regional taxon pool, dispersal limitations, local habitat conditions and biotic interactions. By integrating existing knowledge about these processes from theoretical ecology in a mechanistic model, we can test our mechanistic understanding and disentangle multiple stressor effects on community assembly. 2. To assess to which degree we can predict the community composition of macroinvertebrates, we integrated these processes in the mechanistic food web model Streambugs and tested it on 36 sites in the Glatt catchment on the Swiss plateau. The model predicts the observation probability of taxa from a regional taxon pool at each site taking into account uncertain knowledge on parameters, environmental conditions at the sites and sampling errors. 3. We use allometric scaling according to the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological stoichiometry and autecological data from trait databases that include the current knowledge on habitat requirements of the different taxa to parameterize their growth, respiration and death. 4. Without any calibration, for the majority of taxa at the 36 sites, the difference between the observed and predicted relative frequency of occurrence is < 50% when taking prior parameter uncertainty and the uncertainty of environmental conditions into account (79% compared to 61% for the random model). By calibrating taxon-specific modification factors for the growth rate, we can increase the model compliance with data. 5. Analysing the influence of different ecological traits and their corresponding environmental influence factors reveals that feeding types and sensitivity to organic toxicants contribute most to the predictive capabilities of the model in this catchment. The influence of temperature stress and oxygen depletion due to pollution with organic matter on the community composition is negligible. These results confirm our expectations regarding the most important water quality issues of streams on the Swiss plateau. Current velocity plays an intermediate role in this model application. 6. The contribution of the feeding types to model performance highlights the importance of taking biotic interactions (competition for food sources and predator-prey interactions) into account to predict the coexistence of taxa.

Phylogenetic patterns clustered when there are more close relatives than expected by chance or overdispersed with less close relatives than expected. Patterns among species in a community indicate underlying biotic and abiotic processes acting on species functional traits. However, phylogenetic ecology has seldom been applied to forest restoration. We used floristic and abundance data from six forest restoration sites of different ages and four old-growth reference forests in the Brazilian Atlantic forest to evaluate similarities in phylogenetic patterns between restoration and reference forests as a measure of restoration success. The presence of an initial tree canopy in restoration forests conducted by planting species increases seed dispersal. Nevertheless, we expected random phylogenetic patterns early in restoration due to dispersal limitation in a highly fragmented landscape. As time since planting increases and in reference forests, we expected less of an effect of dispersal on community composition and more of an effect of negative biotic interactions among close relatives to lead to overdispersed patterns. We did not find a clear trajectory showing that restoration sites would resemble the phylogenetic patterns of reference sites with age since planting. We found significant clustering patterns in two sites, the oldest restoration site and one reference forest. The other reference forests showed, non-significant yet clustering tendencies. The functional traits studied were less conserved than expected by chance, therefore, we cannot relate clustering to be solely the result of environmental filters leading to the presence of close relatives with similar habitat requirements. The presence of closely related species in the Meliaceae family in reference forests and in the oldest restoration site, which was next to a forest remnant, points toward dispersal as the main factor driving phylogenetic patterns in the sites studied. Despite the use of a high number of planted species, differences in the composition of planted species among sites also affected the observed phylogenetic structure. We believe that phylogenetic ecology complements floristic studies by providing information on trait conservatism and shedding light on community assembly processes that affect the successional trajectory of restoration forest.

Trait-based approaches have already been reported for separate soil groups like bacteria, nematodes and collembolans but investigating these groups together could bring better insights in assessing both environmental pressures and state of the systems. Still, selecting a suite of single traits that might encompass the large heterogeneity in soil biota remains a challenge for community trait based analyses. We sampled arable fields and their adjacent (buffer zone) margins to investigate overall trait-based responses of the soil community to agricultural management. We explored the suitability of three groups of functional traits (i.e. eco-physiological traits, behavioural traits and faunal morphological traits) to analyse how different components of the soil biota (fungi, bacteria, micro- and mesofauna) respond to agricultural management and to what extent the selected traits detect effects on soil functioning. For microbes, we opted for eco-physiological trait proxies due to the difficulties to study these organisms at individual level. Our results showed that eco-physiological traits reflected differences in nutrient cycling dynamics and carbon storage driven by the soil microbial community. The structural organization of micro- and the mesofauna trophic grouping and body mass distribution reflected effects of agricultural management on soil assemblages and revealed differences in the responses of these groups to the environment. We recognize some methodological limitations of our comprehensive community trait based approach. Yet our analysis reveals characteristics of the soil community structure and belowground ecological processes, as i.e. the partial shift from the bacterial- to the fungal-driven energy channels, that could not be detected by traditional methods, showing the potential of this approach in determining environmental pressures and in evaluating ecosystem services.

Although it is possible to predict species richness (SR) patterns along environmental gradients, whether functional diversity (FD) changes in predictable ways is not known. In arid environments, SR typically increases with rainfall. Aridity may limit functional differentiation by allowing only certain traits, but could also be associated with diverse traits associated with various strategies for coping with spatial and temporal variation in resources. Rare species may have unique traits, making them particularly important to continued ecosystem function. We investigated SR, FD, and functional differentiation in bird assemblages along an aridity gradient, with attention to functional uniqueness of rare species. We surveyed bird communities in open savanna, bush-thickened, and riparian habitats at five sites of increasing aridity (similar to 150-400 mm rainfall year(-1)) in wet and dry seasons for 3 years in Namibia. We calculated the standardized effect size of FD (sesFD) as a measure of functional differentiation and used mixed models to ascertain how SR, FD, and sesFD relate to rainfall, season, and habitat type. SR and FD increased with increasing rainfall. Conversely, sesFD declined with increasing rainfall and was lower in woody habitats, suggesting habitat filtering and greater niche overlap. Rare species were more functionally unique than common species, in all three habitats, so loss of rare species could degrade ecosystem function.

The present study investigated factors that govern species-specific accumulation patterns of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in a food web from Sydney Estuary (Australia). The results indicated that physiological characteristics, i.e. lipid %, spatial, i.e. distance from Homebush Bay (point source of POPs) and life history characteristics of the organisms, such as diet and home range, influence PCDD/F and dl-PCB tissue concentrations to a varying degree. For example, PCDD/F tissue concentrations increased with the presence of detritivorous diet, species with limited home range and close proximity to Homebush Bay. On the other hand, lipid %, piscivorous diet and close proximity to Homebush Bay were the main predictors causing increases in dl-PCB tissue levels. Distance from Homebush Bay was the only predictor affecting both PCDD/F and dl-PCB tissue levels at a similar rate, i.e. decreasing tissue concentrations as the distance increases from Homebush Bay.

However, the effect that land-use change may have on the spatial dissimilarities in taxonomic and functional composition of remaining assemblages (i.e., taxonomic/functional beta-diversity) remains poorly understood. We examined a large vegetation database from an old and severely fragmented Atlantic forest landscape to test two alternative hypotheses: (1) tree assemblages experience a taxonomic and functional homogenization (reduced beta-diversity) between forest fragments and along forest edges, or alternatively, (2) these edge-affected forests show increased taxonomic and functional differentiation (increased beta-diversity) when compared to forest interior (reference) stands. Taxonomic and functional beta-diversity were examined via novel abundance-based metrics and considering functional traits related to plant dispersion, recruitment, and growth. Overall, taxonomic beta-diversity among fragments was significantly higher than among edge and reference plots. Edge plots also showed higher beta-diversity than reference plots, but only when considering dominant species. In functional terms, beta-diversity among reference plots was also lower than among forest fragments and among edge plots. These patterns support the landscape-divergence hypothesis, which postulates that variable human disturbances among forest fragments and along forest edges can lead to contrasting trajectories of vegetation changes, thus increasing the compositional and functional -differentiation of tree communities in these emerging environments. Our results also show that such differentiation can preserve landscape-wide biodiversity, thus overriding negative effects of habitat fragmentation on local (a) diversity. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that forest fragments and forest edges can be more valuable for maintaining species diversity and ecosystem function in fragmented tropical landscapes than previously thought.",10.1890/15-1673.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"traits = SLA, leaf area, wood density, max height, seed size",

Most squid species have the potential for high dispersal rates due to lengthy planktonic paralarval stages and highly migratory adult stages. Such life-history traits lead to predictions of genetic homogeneity (i.e. panmixia) of squid populations across large geographical areas. However, testing this hypothesis can be difficult, because spawning populations of squid are highly mobile and spawning sites are either unknown or spread sparsely over large geographical areas. Loligo reynaudii and Doryteuthis (Amerigo) pealeii are 2 squid species that are commercially fished on inshore spawning grounds located off the coasts of South Africa and the eastern USA, respectively, and for which highly localised spawning aggregations have been documented. We sampled discrete spawning aggregations of these 2 neritic species, so that the highest likelihood of sampling true reproductive populations was achieved, in order to determine whether such spawning aggregations represent discrete genetic populations. As has been reported for many squid species, the levels of genetic diversity detected at nuclear microsatellite DNA loci, within both L. reynaudii and D. pealeii, were high and consistent across all samples. Our results for D. pealeii indicated that adjustments of allele frequencies using MICROCHECKER to take the presence of null alleles into account may introduce bias, due to the presence of loci with small numbers of common alleles; this leads to a conclusion that there is significant genetic differentiation among populations where none exists. For both species, our results indicated no significant genetic differentiation of populations and, thus, no association of spawning aggregations with distinct genetic subpopulations, across the main spawning ranges sampled.",10.3354/meps08593,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,Not env filtering,

Traditional intraguild predation (IGP) models have only relatively small regions of stable coexistence of all species. Here, we investigate potential additional mechanisms that extend these regions of stable coexistence. We used a 3-species Lotka-Volterra system to which we added an interaction term to model a unidirectional facilitative relationship between the two predators in the IGP. In this modelling study the IG predator was able to precondition a part of the common resource by an instantaneous manipulation, which resulted in the immobilization of the resource species. This mechanism of immobilization facilitated the resource uptake by the IG prey and thus increased its growth rates even in the presence of the common predator. The facilitative relationship of the IG prey by the IG predator produced a stable coexistence of both predators even though the IG prey was an inferior competitor for a common resource, which cannot be attained with the traditional IGP models. Furthermore, our model predicted a 3-species stable coexistence even at high enrichment where no coexistence was found in the basic IGP model. Thus, we showed that diversity of resource traits could significantly alter emergent community patterns via shifts in exploitative competition of IGP-related predators. The described mechanism could potentially lead to a higher efficiency in exploitation of common resources and thus promote higher diversity in a real community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The model consists of two predators with an intraguild predation (IGP) relation competing for a common resource. The resource is subdivided into subpopulations of different quality that are distinguished by grazing rates of the two predators, contact rates between subpopulations and mortality rates. The proposed system describes an exchange of traits between species from distinct subpopulations by using a species interaction term. In particular, we examine the percentage of stable coexistence solutions versus resource carrying capacity and contact rates between distinct resource pools. We also present a numerical comparison of the percentage of stable food webs found for different numbers of subpopulations. While at high enrichment no stable coexistence was found in the IGP system with a single resource, our model predicts a stable coexistence of two IGP-related predators and resources at high and intermediate enrichment already at a low contact rate between subpopulations.",10.1103/PhysRevE.88.062721,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = grazing rate, mortality rate",

Here, we integrated the analysis of phylobetadiversity and marked point pattern analysis to yield a new metric, the phylogenetic mark correlation function, k(d)(r), to quantify spatial phylogenetic structure of fully stem-mapped communities.k(d)(r) is defined as the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics separated by spatial distance r, and normalized with the expected phylogenetic distance of two heterospecifics taken randomly from a study area. It measures spatial phylogenetic turnover relative to spatial species turnover and is closely related with the spatially explicit Simpson index. We used simulated fully stem-mapped plant communities with known spatial phylogenetic structures to assess type I and II errors of the phylogenetic mark correlation function k(d)(r) under a null model of random phylogenetic spatial structure, and to test the ability of the k(d)(r) to detect scale-dependent signals of phylogenetic spatial structure. We also compared the performance of the k(d)(r) with two existing measures of phylobetadiversity that have been previously used to analyse fully stem-mapped plots. Finally, we explored the spatial phylogenetic structure of a 24-ha fully stem-mapped subtropical forest in China. Simulation tests showed that the new metric yielded correct type I and type II errors and accurately detected the spatial scales at which various processes (e.g. habitat filtering and competition) were invoked to generate spatial phylogenetic structures. The power of the k(d)(r) was not affected by a phylogenetic signal in species abundance and different topologies of the phylogenetic tree. Replacing phylogenetic distance by functional distance allows for application of the k(d)(r) to estimate spatial correlations in functional community structure. Thus, the k(d)(r) allows trait and phylogenetic structure to be analysed in the same framework. The phylogenetic mark correlation function is a powerful and accurate tool for revealing scale-dependent phylogenetic/functional footprints in community assemblages and allows ecologists to keep up with the increasingly available data of fully stem-mapped plots, functional traits and community phylogenies.",10.1111/2041-210X.12119,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

LocationPermanent grasslands across France (including mainland and Corsica), as a receding ecosystem of great conservation importance. MethodsFocusing on 121 alien plant species occurring in 7,215 vegetation plots, we quantified biotic similarity between new invaders and resident alien species (i.e., alien species with longer residence times) based on phylogenetic and trait distances. Additionally, we calculated distances to native species for each alien species and plot. Using multispecies distribution models, we analysed the influence of these biotic similarity measures and additional covariates on establishment success (presence/absence) of new invaders. ResultsWe found that biotic similarity to resident alien species consistently increased establishment success of more recently introduced species. Phylogenetic relatedness to previous invaders had an equally strong positive effect as relatedness to native species. Conversely, trait similarity to natives hindered alien establishment as predicted by Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. These results highlight that various mechanisms may act simultaneously to determine alien establishment success. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that, with greater similarity among alien species, invasion success increases. Such a pattern may arise either due to actual facilitation among invaders or as a result of weaker competitive interactions among invaders than between native and alien species, leading to an indirect facilitative effect. Alternatively, recent environmental changes (e.g., eutrophication, climate change) may have added new environmental filters.

Here, we use a meta-analysis to test the prediction that predation pressure on sea urchins, a group of consumers with a particularly strong influence on community structure in the world's oceans, is strongest in the tropics. We then examine which biotic and abiotic factors best correlate with biogeographic and within habitat patterns in sea urchin responses to predation. Consistent with expectations, predator impacts on sea urchins were highest in tropical coral reefs and decreased towards the poles in rocky reef habitats (> 25 degrees absolute latitude). However, latitude and temperature were weakly correlated with effect sizes, and the strongest predictor of predator impacts was sea urchin species. This suggests an important role of prey identity (i.e. traits including behaviour, physical, and chemical defences) rather than large scale abiotic factors in determining variation in interaction strengths. Ecosystem-shaping sea urchins such as Tripneustes gratilla, Diadema savignyi and Centrostephanus rodgersii were strongly impacted by consumers, indicating a tight coupling between predators of these species and their boom and bust prey.

Contemporary theories suggest these traits have evolved as warning signals because they can facilitate both associative and discriminative avoidance learning in predators. However, it is unclear why these particular traits and not others have tended to evolve in unprofitable prey. Here we show using a signal detection model that unprofitable prey will evolve conspicuous colours and patterns partly because these characteristics cannot readily evolve in profitable prey without close mimicry. The stability of this signal is maintained through the costs of dishonesty in profitable prey. Indeed, unprofitable prey will sometimes evolve a conspicuous form to reduce mimetic parasitism, even in the unlikely event that this form can be more closely mimicked. This is one of the first mathematical models of the evolution of warning signals to allow for the possibility of mimicry, yet our analyses suggest it may offer a general explanation as to why warning signals take the form that they do.

The degree to which these different spatial factors contribute to plant communities is not well understood, because few studies have used a uniform sampling methodology to measure trait variation across the range of ecological scales. In this study, a stratified sampling method was used to study community weighted leaf traits and environment factors at different spatial (transect and plot) scales. We measured 6 leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf tissue density, leaf thickness, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content) in 258 communities from 57 sites in 9 transects nested within 3 vegetation zones. These communities are located in the loess hilly and gully area of the Yanhe river watershed. We coupled climatic factors at the transect scale with topographic and edaphic factors at the plot scale using multilevel regression modeling to analyze the trait variation associated with spatial scales. At the transect scale, the mean annual rainfall showed a highly significant positive effect on the leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) (p < 0.01), while it had a highly significant negative effect on leaf thickness (LT) and leaf tissue density (LTD) (p < 0.001) and a significant negative effect on leaf carbon concentration (LCC) (p < 0.05), explaining 10.91%, 36.08%, 57.25% and 66.01% of LTD, LT, LCC and LNC variation at transect scale respectively. At a plot scale, the slope aspect showed a highly significant positive effect on specific leaf area (SLA) and LNC but a highly significant negative effect on LT and LTD. The soil water content had a significant negative effect on LT (p < 0.05) and LTD (p < 0.001) while soil organic matter showed a positive effect on SLA (p < 0.001) and LNC (p < 0.01). Totally, plot scale variables explained 7.28%, 43.60%, 46.43%, 75.39% and 81.17% of LCC, LT, LNC, LTD and SLA variation. The elevation showed positive effect only on LCC (p < 0.05). The results confirmed the existence of consistent trait-environment relationships at both transect and plot scales. These trait-environment relationships at different spatial scales will provide mechanistic understanding on the vegetation community assembly in the study area. Practically, ignoring trait variation within transects will underestimate roles of microhabitat filters in community assembly, and leads to the homogenization of restoration species.

The history of the former concept dates to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and has more recently been systemized in the twenty-first century. Approaches to the understanding of phenotypic plasticity and learning behavior have only recently been developed, based on cellular-histological and behavioral-neurobiological techniques as well as traditional molecular biology. New developments of the former concepts in phenotypic plasticity are discussed in bacterial persistence, wing di-/polymorphism with transgenerational effects, polyphenism in social insects, and defense traits for predator avoidance, including molecular biology analyses. We also discuss new studies on the concept of genetic accommodation resulting in evolution of phenotypic plasticity through a transgenerational change in the reaction norm based on a threshold model. Learning behavior can also be understood as physiological phenotypic plasticity, associating with the brain-nervous system, and it drives the accelerated evolutionary change in behavioral response (the Baldwin effect) with memory stock. Furthermore, choice behaviors are widely seen in decision-making of animal foragers.

This predictive ability largely surpassed that of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) or detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordinations. Using cross-validation with 1000 independent runs, the median correlation between observed and predicted relative abundances was 0.560 (the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles were 0.045 and 0.825). The qualitative predictions of the model were also noteworthy: dominant species were correctly identified in 53% of the quadrats, 83% of rare species were correctly predicted to have a relative abundance of <0.05, and the median predicted relative abundance of species actually absent from a quadrat was 5 x 10(-5).",10.1890/10-0394.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,1,1,1,0,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"C3/C4, forb, perennial, height, leaf area, LDMC, SLA, specific root length, seed mass, mean julian flowering date, flowering duration, leaf C content, leaf N content, leaf C:N mass ratio, fine-root carbon content, fine-root N content, fine-root C:N mass ratio, leaf C13, leaf 15N ",

This study investigates the occurrence of variations in morphological traits among wild populations of zebrafish (Danio rerio) from India that inhabit a variety of habitat and ecological regimes. Geometric morphometric methods and traditional morphometric analysis were used to quantify the extent of differences in morphological traits between four populations of wild D. rerio from still-water (stagnant) (Kalibazaar, in West Bengal) and slow -medium flowing (Asan, Kaushalya and Seripetkalwa in Uttarakhand, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh respectively) habitats within India. Multivariate analyses showed significant effect of populations on morphology, post-hoc paired comparisons between populations show differences in body size as well as shape across these populations. Relative warps analyses on the landmarks selected for body shape showed higher loadings for caudal peduncle, head and eye regions. Population-wise scatterplots along relative warp1 (RW1)- relative warp4 (RW4) axes revealed Asan population cluster expands beyond the other population clusters along the RW1- RW2 axes, while the Kalibazaar cluster spreads out from the others along the RW3-RW4 axes. Multiple regression models to predict relation between shape and ecological attributes indicate the strongest role of dissolved oxygen, stream velocity and abundance of predators in explaining variations in morphology across these populations. This is significant as a first study utilising the tools of morphometric analyses in Danio rerio and indicating the role of multiple (biotic and abiotic) selective forces in shaping phenotypic variations in morphology.",10.1007/s10641-017-0576-3,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits =- body shape,
"Shultz, S; Dunbar, RIM",2010,Social bonds in birds are associated with brain size and contingent on the correlated evolution of life-history and increased parental investment,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,"In birds, large brains are associated with a series of population-level phenomena, including invasion success, species richness, and resilience to population decline. Thus, they appear to open up adaptive opportunities through flexibility in foraging and anti-predator behaviour. The evolutionary pathway leading to large brain size has received less attention than behavioural and ecological correlates. Using a comparative approach, we show that, independent of previously recognized associations with developmental constraints, relative brain size in birds is strongly related to biparental care, pair-bonding, and stable social relationships. We also demonstrate correlated evolution between large relative brain size and altricial development, and that the evolution of both traits is contingent on biparental care. Thus, biparental care facilitates altricial development, which permits the evolution of large relative brain size. Finally, we show that large relative brain size is associated with pair-bond strength, itself a likely consequence of cooperation and negotiation between partners under high levels of parental investment. These analyses provide an evolutionary model for the evolution of and prevalence of biparental care, altricial development, and pair-bonding in birds.

This framework is used to predict the responses of age at maturation, size at maturation, and asymptotic size to changes in the predator -prey size ratio. Predators feeding on relatively smaller prey (i.e., having larger predator -prey size ratios) have lower growth efficiency and are predicted as a consequence to mature earlier, at smaller sizes, and reach smaller asymptotic sizes. This prediction was tested using a 78-year time series (1936-2013) of data from a natural population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Opeongo, Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. A large decrease in the predator -prey size ratio for this population occurred over the period 1950-1965 when a preferred prey (cisco, Coregonus artedii) was introduced to the lake. This decrease was followed by 20 years of constancy in the size ratio and then 25 years of progressive increase. Lake trout life history responded plastically during both periods and consistently with our predictions. Extensive analysis of available data provided little empirical support for alternative explanations for the observed changes in lake trout size and maturity (e.g., changes in cisco and (or) lake trout density and harvest rates). The framework developed here derives plastic life history changes from fixed developmental thresholds that are based on the scaling of net production with body size and can be used to predict the shape of maturation reaction norms for the major shifts in community structure that are compactly summarized by changes in size spectrum parameters.",10.1139/cjfas-2015-0190,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,Lake,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = body size, age at maturation, size at maturation",

Exploring taxonomic and functional aspects of biodiversity simultaneously can better understand the processes of community assembly. We analysed taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities of breeding bird assemblages on land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. Given the high dispersal ability of most birds at this spatial scale (several kilometres), we predicted (i) selective extinction driving alpha and beta diversities after the creation of land-bridge islands of varying area and (ii) low taxonomic and functional beta diversities that were not correlated to spatial distance. Breeding birds were surveyed on 37 islands annually from 2007 to 2014. We decomposed beta diversity of breeding birds into spatial turnover and nestedness-resultant components, and related taxonomic and functional diversities to island area and isolation using power regression models (for alpha diversity) and multiple regression models on distance matrices (for beta diversity). We then ran simulations to assess the strength of the correlations between taxonomic and functional diversities. Results revealed that both taxonomic and functional alpha diversities increased with island area. The taxonomic nestedness-resultant and turnover components increased and decreased with difference in area, respectively, but functional counterparts did not. Isolation played a minor role in explaining alpha- and beta-diversity patterns. By partitioning beta diversity, we found low levels of overall taxonomic and functional beta diversities. The functional nestedness-resultant component dominated overall functional beta diversity, whereas taxonomic turnover was the dominant component for taxonomic beta diversity. The simulation showed that functional alpha and beta diversities were significantly correlated with taxonomic diversities, and the observed values of correlations were significantly different from null expectations of random extinction. Our assessment of island bird assemblages validated the predictions of no distance effects and low beta diversity due to pervasive dispersal events among islands and also suggested that selective extinction drives taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities. The contrasting turnover and nestedness-resultant components of taxonomic and functional beta diversities demonstrate the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of biodiversity when examining community assembly.",10.1111/1365-2656.12478,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Marine,Birds,Islands,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body mass, main feeding guild, main feeding stratum, main feeding behaviour",

Here, we extend the classic Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) to account for nonrandom processes by incorporating species traits and phylogenetic relationships into a study of faunal relaxation following habitat loss and fragmentation. Two possible mechanisms can create nonrandom community patterns on fragment islands. First, small and isolated islands might consist of similar or closely related species because they are environmentally homogeneous or select for certain shared traits, such as dispersal ability. Alternatively, communities on small islands might contain more dissimilar or distantly related species than on large islands because limited space and resource availability result in greater competitive exclusion among species with high niche overlap. Breeding birds were surveyed on 36 islands and two mainland sites annually from 2010 to 2014 in the Thousand Island Lake region, China. We assessed community structure of breeding birds on these subtropical land-bridge islands by integrating species' trait and evolutionary distances. We additionally analysed habitat heterogeneity and variance in size ratios to distinguish biotic and abiotic processes of community assembly. Results showed that functional-phylogenetic diversity increased with island area, and decreased with isolation. Bird communities on the mainland were more diverse and generally less clustered than island bird communities and not different than randomly assembled communities. Bird communities on islands tend to be functionally similar and phylogenetically clustered, especially on small and isolated islands. The nonrandom decline in species diversity and change in bird community structure with island area and isolation, along with the relatively homogeneous habitats on small islands, support the environmental filtering hypothesis. Our study demonstrates the importance of integrating multiple forms of diversity for understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, and further reveals that TIB could be extended to community measures by moving beyond assumptions of species equivalency in colonisation rates and extinction susceptibilities.",10.1111/1365-2656.12650,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Marine,Birds,Islands,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,2,"traits = body mass, main feeding guild, main feeding stratum, main feeding behaviour",

However, the question of how imperfect detection of species affects estimates of functional and phylogenetic community structure remains untested. We used long-term counts of breeding bird species that were detected at least once on islands in a land-bridge island system, and employed multi-species occupancy models to assess the effects of imperfect detection of species on estimates of bird diversity and community structure by incorporating species traits and phylogenies. Our results showed that taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity were all underestimated significantly as a result of species' imperfect detection, with taxonomic diversity showing the greatest bias. The functional and phylogenetic structure calculated from observed communities were both more clustered than those from the detection-corrected communities due to missed distinct species. The discrepancy between observed and estimated diversity differed according to the measure of biodiversity employed. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for species' imperfect detection in biodiversity studies, especially for functional and phylogenetic community ecology, and when attempting to infer community assembly processes. With datasets that allow for detection-corrected community structure, we can better estimate diversity and infer the underlying mechanisms that structure community assembly, and thus make reliable management decisions for the conservation of biodiversity.",10.1002/ecy.2438,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Spatial patterns of functional turnover, or functional beta diversity, may capture important signals of niche-based assembly processes, but these patterns have not been quantified for communities across broad geographic and environmental gradients. Here, we analyse continental-scale patterns of species and functional beta diversity in relation to space and the environment to assess the relative importance of niche-based and neutral community assembly mechanisms. Location Eastern North America. Methods We use a continental-scale forest plot dataset and functional trait data to quantify spatial patterns of species and functional beta diversity. We use redundancy analysis-based variance partitioning to evaluate the influence of space, soil and climate on beta-diversity metrics. We use a null model approach to test for non-random functional beta diversity given the observed patterns of species turnover across spatial scales. Results Species and functional beta diversity increased with increasing geographic distance (i.e. distance decay of community similarity). Results of variance partitioning analysis show that species and functional beta diversity were spatially structured and significantly related to environmental, particularly climatic, variation. Results of null model analysis show that functional beta diversity was lower than expected based on species turnover at fine scales (<600km) and higher than expected at broad scales (>1800km).

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25% of the total trait variation within communities and 32% of the total trait variation among communities on average.

In terms of species number, TFgr A was predominant in clean areas while TFgrs B and N were dominant in heavy polluted areas and TFgr R was dominant in slightly polluted area. The trophic-functional patterns of the periphytic ciliate communities showed a clear spatial variation within the pollution gradient. Trophic-functional trait diversity measures represented a clear increasing trend from polluted stations to the clean area regarding the pollution gradients. Multivariate correlation and best matching analysis revealed that the spatial pattern of the trophic-functional groupings were significantly shaped by environmental variable nutrients and chemical oxygen demand, alone or in combination with pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and transparency.

Flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus) was examined based on the patterns of sexual dimorphism from the two rivers in Northern Mindanao. The samples were collected from Cagayan de Oro River and Mandulog River to investigate phenotypic divergence and sexual dimorphism in two different populations of wild-caught M. cephalus using geometric morphology based on landmark basis. A total of 17 landmarks were identified to describe the left and right body shapes of the specimen using the TpsRelw (version 1) to obtain the warp scores of each population. Results of the Relative Warp Analysis show no significant variation in the body shape within the sexes in the respective sampling sites. Results of the discriminant function analysis (DFA) show that in Cagayan de Oro River there is no significant variation in the body shape of mullets between sexes suggesting no sexual dimorphism in the flathead mullets in Cagayan de Oro River. In contrast, Discriminant Function Analysis show that there is significant variation in body shape between sexes in Mandulog River in Iligan City suggesting presence of sexual dimorphism in the area which can be due to the presence of abundant and highly diverse predator species in Mandulog River. Sexual dimorphosm can be used by fishes as an adaptive mechanism to maximize predator-escape performance and survival capacity. Furthermore, there is a significant shape variation between populations of mullets in Cagayan de Oro and Mandulog River which can be interpreted as due to geographic isolation which serves as physical barrier on the gene pool.

Declining rainfall in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southwestern Australia, has decreased the depth and duration of water in temporary wetlands, potentially altering the composition of invertebrate communities. We used a long-term data set (6-25 y) to examine temporal changes in hydroregimes and aquatic invertebrate diversity (based on species presence/absence) at 9 seasonal wetlands. The study wetlands maintained distinctly seasonal hydroregimes, despite declining rainfall and the contraction of wetland hydroperiods. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) indicated that conductivity, NO3-+NO2-, and turbidity were the most important factors explaining the changes in invertebrate community composition over time. Allocation of species into 4 trait-based groups based on their resilience to or resistance of drought and their mode of recolonization of a water body upon rewetting revealed that the fauna is dominated by active dispersers. This result suggests that the proximity of source wetlands from which mobile invertebrate species and vertebrate vectors, such as waterbirds, can recolonize seasonal wetlands is an important factor influencing the invertebrate community response to rewetting. Despite the decline in water availability, we found little evidence of a shift to a more arid-adapted fauna. We suggest that the maintenance of a mosaic of wetlands of varying hydroregimes at the whole-landscape scale will be critical to the future persistence of aquatic invertebrate communities in Mediterranean regions where the frequency and intensity of droughts is predicted to increase.",10.1899/12-024.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Broad,Wetland,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = mode of recolonization, resilience/resistance to drought",

A critique of ideas on the evolution of giraffe,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,"Recent years have witnessed a resurgence in tests of the evolution and origin of the great height and long neck of the giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis. The two main hypotheses are (1) long necks evolved through competition with other browsers allowing giraffe to feed above them ('competing browsers' hypothesis); or (2) the necks evolved for direct use in intra-sexual combat to gain access to oestrous females ('necks-for-sex' hypothesis). Here, we review recent developments and their relative contribution in explaining giraffe evolution. Trends from Zimbabwean giraffes show positive allometry for male necks and isometry for female necks relative to body mass, while comparative analyses of the cervical versus the total vertebral column of the giraffe, okapi and fossil giraffe suggest selection specifically on neck length rather than on overall height. Both support the necks-for-sex idea. Neither study, however, allows us to refute one of the two ideas. We suggest new approaches for quantifying the relative importance of the two hypotheses. A direct analysis of selection pressure on neck length via survival and reproduction should clarify the mechanism maintaining the trait, while we predict that short robust ossicones should have arisen concurrently with incipient neck elongation if sexual selection was the main selective driver. The main challenge for the competing browser hypothesis is to explain why giraffe have remained about 2 m taller than their tallest competitors for over 1 Myr, whereas the sexual selection hypothesis cannot provide an adaptive explanation for the long neck of female giraffe. We conclude that probably both mechanisms have contributed to the evolution and maintenance of the long neck, and their relative importance can be clarified further.",10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00711.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Simova, I; Rueda, M; Hawkins, BA",2017,Stress from cold and drought as drivers of functional trait spectra in North American angiosperm tree assemblages,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Understanding how environmental change alters the composition of plant assemblages, and how this in turn affects ecosystem functioning is a major challenge in the face of global climate change. Assuming that values of plant traits express species adaptations to the environment, the trait-based approach is a promising way to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, how functional traits are related to species' environmental tolerances and how trait spectra respond to broad-scale environmental gradients remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify the main trait spectra for US angiosperm trees by testing hypotheses for the relationships between functional traits and species' environmental tolerances to environmental stresses, as well as quantifying the environmental drivers of assemblage means and variances of these traits. We analyzed >74,000 community assemblages from the US Forest Inventory and Analysis using 12 functional traits, five traits expressing species' environmental tolerances and 10 environmental variables. Results indicated that leaf traits, dispersal traits, and traits related to stem hydraulics were related to cold or drought tolerance, and their assemblage means were best explained by minimum temperatures. Assemblage means of traits related to shade tolerance (tree growth rate, leaf phosphorus content, and bark thickness) were best explained by aridity index. Surprisingly, aridity index, rather than minimum temperature, was the best predictors of assemblage variances of most traits, although these relationships were variable and weak overall. We conclude that temperature is likely to be the most important driver of functional community structure of North American angiosperm trees by selecting for optimum strategies along the cold and drought stress trade-off.

Results: For woody assemblages, we found a strong climate signal for both means and variances of most of the studied traits, consistent with strong environmental filtering. In contrast, for herbaceous assemblages, spatial patterns of trait means and variances were more variable, the climate signal on trait means was often different and weaker. Main conclusion: Trait variations for woody versus herbaceous assemblages appear to reflect alternative strategies and differing environmental constraints.

At the same time, the role of predators in the evolution of herbivore dietary specialization has been an unresolved issue in evolutionary ecology. Here, we integrate these perspectives by testing the role of herbivore diet breadth as a predictor of top-down effects of avian predators on herbivores and plants in a forest food web. Using experimental bird exclosures to study a complex community of trees, caterpillars, and birds, we found a robust positive association between caterpillar diet breadth (phylodiversity of host plants used) and the strength of bird predation across 41 caterpillar and eight tree species. Dietary specialization was associated with increased enemy-free space for both camouflaged (n = 33) and warningly signaled (n = 8) caterpillar species. Furthermore, dietary specialization was associated with increased crypsis (camouflaged species only) and more stereotyped resting poses (camouflaged and warningly signaled species), but was unrelated to caterpillar body size. These dynamics in turn cascaded down to plants: a metaanalysis (n = 15 tree species) showed the beneficial effect of birds on trees (i.e., reduced leaf damage) decreased with the proportion of dietary specialist taxa composing a tree species' herbivore fauna. We conclude that herbivore diet breadth is a key functional trait underlying the trophic effects of carnivores on both herbivores and plants.",10.1073/pnas.1401949111,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Insects,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = diet breadth, crypticity, chemical defence, resting substrate, behavioural stereotypy, body length",

Beta diversity analyses provide key information for understanding biotic homogenization, especially given recent conceptual and methodological advances. Here, we investigated if landscape modification was associated with taxonomic homogenization in 32 stream insect communities from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We investigated: (1) if the way we defined landscape affected our estimates of beta diversity; (2) to what extent changes in species composition versus relative abundance caused the observed homogenization; and (3) if environmental heterogeneity among modified habitats influenced homogenization. We detected taxonomic homogenization caused by landscape modification only when we used refined landscape categorizations and abundance-based diversity measures. For forested streams, changes in relative abundance rather than absolute taxonomic composition increased the biological variation. Forested streams were generally more heterogeneous, with a variable set of abundant genera; by contrast, non-forested streams were more homogeneous, with the same set of genera being more or less abundant. We suggest that landscape modification by agriculture, pasture, and silviculture reduces beta diversity by limiting the colonization of potential species, and, ultimately, causing taxonomic homogenization. Studies investigating biotic homogenization should include multiple dissimilarity measures representing changes in relative species abundance and community composition.

Entre os riachos florestados, mudancas na abundancia relativa, e nAo na composicAo taxonomica absoluta, aumentaram a variacAo biologica. Riachos florestados foram, de modo geral, mais heterogeneos biologicamente, com um conjunto variavel de generos dominantes; por outro lado, riachos nAo florestados foram mais homogeneos, com o mesmo conjunto de generos sendo mais ou menos abundantes. Nos sugerimos que a modificacAo da paisagem pela agricultura, pastagem e silvicultura reduz diversidade beta, limitando a colonizacAo de especies potenciais, consequentemente, causando homogeneizacAo taxonomica.

"Sitzia, T; Dainese, M; Krusi, BO; McCollin, D",2017,Landscape metrics as functional traits in plants: perspectives from a glacier foreland,PEERJ,"Spatial patterns of vegetation arise from an interplay of functional traits, environmental characteristics and chance. The retreat of glaciers offers exposed substrates which are colonised by plants forming distinct patchy patterns. The aim of this study was to unravel whether patch-level landscape metrics of plants can be treated as functional traits. We sampled 46 plots, each 1 m x 1 m, distributed along a restricted range of terrain age and topsoil texture on the foreland of the Nardis glacier, located in the South-Eastern Alps, Italy. Nine quantitative functional traits were selected for 16 of the plant species present, and seven landscape metrics were measured to describe the spatial arrangement of the plant species' patches on the study plots, at a resolution of 1 cm x 1 cm. We studied the relationships among plant communities, landscape metrics, terrain age and topsoil texture. RLQ-analysis was used to examine trait-spatial configuration relationships. To assess the effect of terrain age and topsoil texture variation on trait performance, we applied a partial-RLQ analysis approach. Finally, we used the fourth-corner statistic to quantify and test relationships between traits, landscape metrics and RLQ axes. Floristically-defined releve clusters differed significantly with regard to several landscape metrics. Diversity in patch types and size increased and patch size decreased with increasing canopy height, leaf size and weight. Moreover, more compact patch shapes were correlated with an increased capacity for the conservation of nutrients in leaves. Neither plant species composition nor any of the landscape metrics were found to differ amongst the three classes of terrain age or topsoil texture. We conclude that patch-level landscape metrics of plants can be treated as species-specific functional traits. We recommend that existing databases of functional traits should incorporate these type of data.",10.7717/peerj.3552,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = canopy height, LDMC, lateral spread, leaf dry weight, SLA, Leaf N content, leaf area, leaf fresh wweight, leaf C content",
"Skeem, Jennifer L.; Polaschek, Devon L. L.; Patrick, Christopher J.; Lilienfeld, Scott O.",2011,Psychopathic Personality: Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Evidence and Public Policy,PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST,"Few psychological concepts evoke simultaneously as much fascination and misunderstanding as psychopathic personality, or psychopathy. Typically, individuals with psychopathy are misconceived as fundamentally different from the rest of humanity and as inalterably dangerous. Popular portrayals of ""psychopaths"" are diverse and conflicting, ranging from uncommonly impulsive and violent criminal offenders to corporate figures who callously and skillfully manuever their way to the highest rungs of the social ladder.Despite this diversity of perspectives, a single well-validated measure of psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 1991; 2003), has come to dominate clinical and legal practice over recent years. The items of the PCL-R cover two basic content domains-an interpersonal-affective domain that encompasses core traits such as callousness and manipulativeness and an antisocial domain that entails disinhibition and chronic antisocial behavior. In most Western countries, the PCL-R and its derivatives are routinely applied to inform legal decisions about criminal offenders that hinge upon issues of dangerousness and treatability. In fact, clinicians in many cases choose the PCL-R over other, purpose-built risk-assessment tools to inform their opinions about what sentence offenders should receive, whether they should be indefinitely incarcerated as a ""dangerous offender"" or ""sexually violent predator,"" or whether they should be transferred from juvenile to adult court.The PCL-R has played an extraordinarily generative role in research and practice over the past three decades-so much so, that concerns have been raised that the measure has become equated in many minds with the psychopathy construct itself (Skeem & Cooke 2010a). Equating a measure with a construct may impede scientific progress because it disregards the basic principle that measures always imperfectly operationalize constructs and that our understanding of a construct is ever-evolving (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). In virtually any domain, the construct-validation process is an incremental one that entails shifts in conceptualization and measurement at successive points in the process of clarifying the nature and boundaries of a hypothetical entity.Despite the predominance of the PCL-R measurement model in recent years, vigorous scientific debates have continued regarding what psychopathy is and what it is not. Should adaptive, positive-adjustment features (on one hand) and criminal and antisocial behaviors (on the other) be considered essential features of the construct? Are anxious and emotionally reactive people that are identified as psychopaths by the PCL-R and other measures truly psychopathic? More fundamentally, is psychopathy a unitary entity (i.e., a global syndrome with a discrete underlying cause), or is it rather a configuration of several distinguishable, but intersecting trait dimensions?Although these and other controversies remain unresolved, theory and research on the PCL-R and alternative measures have begun to clarify the scope and boundaries of the psychopathy construct. In the current comprehensive review, we provide an integrative descriptive framework-the triarchic model-to help the reader make sense of differing conceptualizations. The essence of this model is that alternative perspectives on psychopathy emphasize, to varying degrees, three distinct observable (phenotypic) characteristics: boldness (or fearless dominance), meanness, and disinhibition. The triarchic framework is helpful for clarifying and reconciling seemingly disparate historical conceptions, modern operationalizations, and contemporary research programs on psychopathy.Our review addresses what psychopathy is, whether variants or subtypes exist (i.e., primary and secondary, unsuccessful and successful), the sorts of causal influences that contribute to psychopathy, how early in development psychopathy can validly be identified, and how psychopathy relates to future criminal behavior and treatment outcomes. Despite controversies and nuances inherent in each of these topics, the current state of scientific knowledge bears clear implications for public policy. Policy domains range from whether psychopathic individuals should be held responsible for their criminal actions to whether employers should screen job candidates for tendencies toward psychopathy.In many cases, the findings we review converge to challenge common assumptions that underpin modern applications of psychopathy measures and to call for cautions in their use. For example, contemporary measures of psychopathy, including the PCL-R, appear to evidence no special powers in predicting violence or other crime. Instead, they are about as predictive as purpose-built violence-risk-assessment tools, perhaps because they assess many of the same risk factors as those broader-band tools. Specifically, the PCL-R and other psychopathy measures derive most of their predictive utility from their ""Factor 2"" assessment of antisocial and disinhibitory tendencies; the ""Factor 1"" component of such measures, reflecting interpersonal and affective features more specific to psychopathy, play at best a small predictive role. Similarly, current measures of psychopathy do not appear to moderate the effects of treatment on violent and other criminal behavior. That is, an increasing number of studies suggest that psychopathic individuals are not uniquely ""hopeless"" cases who should be disqualified from treatment, but instead are general ""high-risk"" cases who need to be targeted for intensive treatment to maximize public safety.Misunderstandings about the criminal propensities and treatability of individuals achieving high scores on measures like the PCL-R have been perpetuated by professionals who interpret such high scores in a stereotypic manner, without considering nuances or issues of heterogeneity. A key message of our review is that classical psychopathy, whether measured by the PCL-R or other measures, is not monolithic; instead, it represents a constellation of multiple traits that may include, in varying degrees, the phenotypic domains of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. Measures such as the PCL-R that do not directly assess features of low anxiety, fearlessness, or boldness more broadly tend to identify heterogeneous subgroups of individuals as psychopathic. As a consequence, efforts to apply one-size-fits-all public policies to psychopathic individuals may be doomed to failure. In aggregrate, these conclusions may help to shed light on what psychopathy is, and what it is not, and to guide policy interventions directed toward improved public health and public safety.",10.1177/1529100611426706,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Smallegange, Isabel M.; Caswell, Hal; Toorians, Marjolein E. M.; de Roos, Andre M.",2017,Mechanistic description of population dynamics using dynamic energy budget theory incorporated into integral projection models,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Integral projection models (IPMs) provide a powerful approach to investigate ecological and rapid evolutionary change in quantitative life-history characteristics and population dynamics. IPMs are constructed from functions that describe the demographic rates - survival, growth and reproduction - in relation to the characteristics of individuals and their environment. Currently, however, demographic rates are estimated using phenomenological regression models that lack a mechanistic representation of the biological processes that give rise to observed demographic variation. This lack of mechanistic underpinning limits the ability of the model to predict future dynamics under novel environmental conditions because the model ingredients pertain to current environmental conditions only. Here, we use dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory to construct DEB-IPMs based on a mechanistic representation of individual life-history trajectories. We derive the demographic functions describing growth and reproduction from a simple DEB growth model. The functions describing mortality and the association between parent and offspring characteristics do not follow DEB theory and hence are estimated from individual-level observations. We apply the DEB-IPM to two contrasting systems: the small, fast-reproducing bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini and the large, slow-reproducing reef manta ray Manta alfredi. In both cases, predictions of population growth rate, lifetime reproductive success and generation time agree with empirical observations. In case of the bulb mite, predictions and observations even agree across different feeding conditions. If the DEB energetics model is accepted as describing growth and reproduction, DEB-IPMs can be parameterised using easy-to-collect life cycle information (growth rate, length at birth, maturation and old age) making them suitable for data-deficient species. Because species differ only in these DEB parameters, comparative studies of character and population dynamics between species are straightforward, particularly since DEB-IPMs can be extended to include population feedback on resources, of which we give an example. Most crucially, because DEB theory specifies growth and reproduction rates as explicitly dependent on environmental conditions such as food availability or temperature, DEB-IPMs provide a mechanistic platform to investigate the biological processes that determine joint change in phenotypic characters, life-history traits, population size and community structure.",10.1111/2041-210X.12675,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

TMIs occur when prey exhibit behavioral or physiological responses to predators and may be more prevalent when abiotic conditions increase prey reactions to consumers. The purpose of this study was to determine if turbulence would alter the distance over which prey in aquatic systems respond to chemical cues emitted by predators in nature, thus changing the scales over which nonlethal predator effects occur. Using hard clams and blue crabs as a model predator-prey system, we investigated the effects of turbulence on clam reactive distance to predatory blue crabs in the field. Results suggest that turbulence diminishes clam reactions to predators and that the environmental context must be considered when predicting the extent of indirect predator effects in natural systems.",10.1007/s00442-008-0995-0,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Smith, Annabel L.",2018,Successional changes in trophic interactions support a mechanistic model of post-fire population dynamics,OECOLOGIA,"Models based on functional traits have limited power in predicting how animal populations respond to disturbance because they do not capture the range of demographic and biological factors that drive population dynamics, including variation in trophic interactions. I tested the hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced reproduction and dispersal.

Annually, in Austra- lia, tropical fish larvae from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are transported south via the East Australian Current (EAC), settling into temperate coastal habitats for the summer period, before experiencing near-100% mortality in winter. However, within 10 years, predicted winter ocean temperatures for the south- east coast of Australia will remain high enough for more of these so-called Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtropical vagrantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to survive over winter. We used a method of morphological niche analysis, previously shown to be an effective predictor of invasion success by fishes, to project which vagrants have the greatest likelihood of undergoing successful range shifts under these new climatic conditions. We find that species from the family of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae), and the moorish idol, Zanclus cornutus, are most likely to be able to exploit new niches within the ecosystem once physiological barriers to overwintering by tropical vagrant species are removed. Overall, the position of vagrants within the morphospace was strongly skewed, suggesting that impending competitive pressures may impact disproportionately on particular parts of the native community.",unkown_27,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Marine,Fish,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Invasion,0,0,1,1,traits = body shape,

This review focuses on the importance of developmental selection, broadly defined as a developmental process that involves the sampling of a range of phenotypes and feedback from the environment reinforcing high-performing phenotypes. I hypothesize that understanding the degree to which developmental selection underlies plasticity is key to predicting the costs, benefits, and consequences of plasticity. First, I review examples that illustrate that elements of developmental selection are common across the development of many different traits, from physiology and immunity to circulation and behavior. Second, I argue that developmental selection, relative to a fixed strategy or determinate (switch) mechanisms of plasticity, increases the probability that an individual will develop a phenotype best matched to the local environment. However, the exploration and environmental feedback associated with developmental selection is costly in terms of time, energy, and predation risk, resulting in major changes in life history such as increased duration of development and greater investment in individual offspring. Third, I discuss implications of developmental selection as a mechanism of plasticity, from predicting adaptive responses to novel environments to understanding conditions under which genetic assimilation may fuel diversification. Finally, I outline exciting areas of future research, in particular exploring costs of selective processes in the development of traits outside of behavior and modeling developmental selection and evolution in novel environments.",10.1093/icb/ics067,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

They are the result not only of a series of ecological processes or ""assembly rules"", but also of past and ongoing evolutionary processes. In recent years, the assembly rules have received increased attention from ecologists and two different processes have been explored: environmental filtering and limiting similarity. As the processes involved in the formation of the assemblages appear to vary in a manner dependent on scale, it is expected that such assembly rules have different effects over different spatial scales. Understanding this relationship between ecological processes and spatial scales in which they act has been a great challenge among scholars. In this context, the incorporation of phylogenetic and functional data to diversity classical approaches have established the basis for an emerging area of research in community ecology, promoting the development of many tools to detect the underlying structure of the assemblages and, therefore, to infer the processes assembly responsible for the formation of the assemblages. Here, we demonstrate how the use of different measures of phylogenetic and functional diversity along with the use of different null models can be a promising approach in solving paradigms still poorly understood, discussing how such methods can increase the predictive power of this growing area of research.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Priority sites differed among taxonomic groups as well as among biodiversity aspects, with low congruence among them.

We aimed to identify the major environmental correlates of diatom distribution patterns in boreal running waters. We classified 197 stream sites based on their diatom flora. Direct ordination methods were then used to identify the key environmental determinants of this diatom-based stream typology. Finally, we tested whether a regional classification scheme based on terrestrial landscapes (ecoregions) provides a reasonable framework for a regional grouping of streams based on their diatom flora. Two-way indicator species analysis produced 13 site groups, which were primarily separated by chemical variables, mainly conductivity, total P and water colour. In partial CCA, the environmental and spatial factors accounted for 38% and 24%, respectively, of explained variation in community composition. A high proportion (almost 40%) of variation explained by the combined effect (spatially-structured environmental) indicated that diatom communities of boreal streams incorporate a strong spatial component. At the level of subecoregions, classification strength was almost equally strong for all sites as for near-pristine reference sites only. Procrustes analysis indicated that spatial factors and patterns in diatom community structure were strongly concordant. Our data support the argument that diatom communities are strongly spatially structured, with distinctly different communities in different parts of the country. Because of the strong spatial patterns of community composition, bioassessment programs utilising lotic diatoms would clearly benefit from regional stratification. A combination of regional stratification and the prediction of assemblage structure from local environmental features might provide the most robust framework for diatom-based assessment of the biological integrity of boreal streams.",10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03749.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

"Soldanova, Miroslava; Kostadinova, Aneta",2011,Rapid colonisation of Lymnaea stagnalis by larval trematodes in eutrophic ponds in central Europe,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY,"High recruitment rates of multiple species and hierarchical competition are the keys to a competitive exclusion model of community assembly in larval trematode communities in molluscs. Eutrophic environments provide conditions for accelerating trematode transmission and this would increase the strength of interspecific interactions. To test these predictions, we provide the first known assessment for a pulmonate snail host, and for highly productive aquatic environments, of the rates of colonisation and extinction at the level of individual snail host patches, of a large guild of trematode species. Using a uniquely large dataset from a relatively long-term mark-recapture study of Lymnaea stagnalis in six eutrophic fishponds in central Europe, we demonstrate extraordinarily rapid colonisation by trematodes of a snail host, thus meeting the assumptions of the competitive exclusion model. Overall annual colonisation rates ranged from 243% to 503% year(-1) so that the odds of trematode establishment in an individual snail in these ponds are two to five times per year. Extinction rates were substantially lower than colonisation rates and, therefore, would not result in turnover rates high enough to significantly affect prevalence patterns in the snail populations. At the species level, analyses of sample-based estimates of probabilities of colonisation revealed that shared species traits associated with transmission and competitive abilities determined the limits of colonisation abilities. Colonisation rates were exceedingly high for the species transmitted to the snails passively via eggs. There was a significant effect of species competitive abilities on colonisation rates due to subordinate species being substantially better colonisers than both strong and weak dominants, a pattern consistent with the predictions of the competition-colonisation trade-off hypothesis. Our results suggest that, with the extraordinarily high trematode colonisation potential in the area studied, the spatial and temporal patterns of intraspecific heterogeneity in recruitment may provide conditions for intensification of interspecific interactions so that complex community assembly rules may be involved.

A long coevolutionary history of brood parasitism and nest predation has favored an adjustment of the host's life-history pattern to the point where total acceptance of a cuckoo egg is now an evolutionarily stable strategy. In a comparative study based on host species as independent observations, some predictions were tested for the European cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) and Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis). In this article I reanalyze the predictions made by Brooker and Brooker using information on the European cuckoo and its hosts in the British Isles while controlling for common phylogenetic descent. Only 1 of the 12 predictions of Brooker and Brooker was supported using the new analyses, and none of the life-history variables was related to rejection behavior of the hosts of the European cuckoo, implying weak support for the hypothesis.

In birds, however, the macroscopic aspects of plumage coloration are less well understood, as past studies typically described plumage colorations by using spectrophotometric analyses. To provide insight into the evolution of plumage patterns as sexual signals, we characterized interspecific and intersexual variations in the plumage patterns of estrildid finches and tested their associations with other courtship signals and life-history traits using a comparative phylogenetic approach. Our results support the idea that plumage patterns in estrildids are favored by sexual selection because large-sized conspicuous plumage patterns are possessed by species with an elaborate courtship dance. These plumage patterns may also play roles in social signaling because patterns are more conspicuous in species with intraspecific brood parasitism. We predict that pattern traits can be favored by mate choice or intrasexual competition when they can serve as honest indicators of individual condition. As our results are consistent between the sexes, we suggest that the same selective force is acting on the evolution of plumage patterns in males and females in parallel. Finally, we also found a trade-off between large size and vivid color patterns, suggesting that too conspicuous patterns are costly, presumably because of the risk of catching the eyes of potential predators. Therefore, plumage patterns are also shaped by natural selection.",10.1093/beheco/ary021,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Hoverfly populations were monitored in three different years (2010, 2011 and 2012) using Malaise traps as the sampling technique. In three years, a total of 48 species were recorded in the two vineyards. Among those, seven species found across three years were not expected in accordance with predictions from the nature of the surrounding habitats (via Syrph the Net). Some of these species are usually associated with dry grassland and may be considered as associated with vineyards, increasing the fauna of these productive habitats. The total number of species seem to be highly similar in the two vineyards, despite the different management. The use of functional traits was much more useful in understanding the differences between the two vineyards. Despite the small distance between the two sites, hoverfly populations were different in the three years. The presence of different habitats adjacent to the two vineyards seem to be the main feature affecting hoverfly populations. In addition, the organic vineyard showed a higher percentage of species associated with the herb and root layers. These taxa can be associated with the adjacent wood and/or with the vineyard since the latter is characterized by an improved vegetation management typical of an organic system (e.g. the grass cover technique).

Moreover, recently assembled large-scale databases hold comprehensive per-species data on plant functional traits, allowing a detailed functional description of many plant communities on Earth. Here, we show that plant functional traits can be used as predictors of vegetation response to climate warming, accounting in our test ecosystem (the species-rich alpine belt of Caucasus mountains, Russia) for 59% of variability in the per-species abundance relation to temperature. In this mountain belt, traits that promote conservative leaf water economy (higher leaf mass per area, thicker leaves) and large investments in belowground reserves to support next year's shoot buds (root carbon content) were the best predictors of the species increase in abundance along with temperature increase.

If abiotic heterogeneity was strong enough (Selection hypothesis), we expected niche clustering and reduced niche overlap between species and between ecological groups, phylogenetic clustering, significant beta-diversity departure from a random expectation after controlling for alpha-diversity variation, and non-random trait distribution due to abiotic filtering and limiting similarity. Null expectations were predicted under the Neutral hypothesis. Under the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis, we expected niche clustering and reduced niche overlap as in the Selection hypothesis, but random phylogenetic distribution, random beta-diversity variation, and random trait distribution due to niche-based specialization but weak habitat matching resulting from dispersal limitation and drift. We used a series of null models to provide an integrative evaluation of community assembly including species abundances, environmental preferences, phylogenetic relatedness, and trait distribution. Results supported the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis due to a combination of reduced niche overlap, niche clustering along soil and disturbance gradients, evidence for abiotic filtering of functional traits but absent phylogenetic structure and random beta-diversity variation. Support to the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis provides evidence for niche-based species selection along environmental gradients, coupled with poor matches between species distributions and environmental factors due to stochastic processes. It also highlights the importance of an integrative approach to the evaluation of community patterns indicative of assembly processes. Had only a subset of the approaches used been employed and different conclusions would have been reached: niche overlap and trait distribution analyses would have indicated a stronger role for selection, while phylogenetic and abundance analyses would have indicated stochastic community assembly. Future research should include different disturbance regimes along with environmental variation in order to assess the interplay of the different drivers that shape the community assembly process, as well as the potential of the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis as an explanation for the assembly process of complex and species-rich subtropical forests.

Despite the widespread acceptance of a positive relationship between biodiversity and resilience, empirical evidence for this relationship remains fairly limited in scope and localized in scale. Assessing resilience at the large landscape and regional scales most relevant to land management and conservation practices has been limited by the ability to measure both diversity and resilience over large spatial scales. Here, we combined tools used in large-scale studies of biodiversity (remote sensing and trait databases) with theoretical advances developed from small-scale experiments to ask whether the functional diversity within a range of woodland and forest ecosystems influences the recovery of productivity after wildfires across the four-corner region of the United States. We additionally asked how environmental variation (topography, macroclimate) across this geographic region influences such resilience, either directly or indirectly via changes in functional diversity. Using path analysis, we found that functional diversity in regeneration traits (fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability) was a stronger predictor of the recovery of productivity after wildfire than the functional diversity of seed mass or species richness. Moreover, slope, elevation, and aspect either directly or indirectly influenced the recovery of productivity, likely via their effect on microclimate, while macroclimate had no direct or indirect effects. Our study provides some of the first direct empirical evidence for functional diversity increasing resilience at large spatial scales. Our approach highlights the power of combining theory based on local-scale studies with tools used in studies at large spatial scales and trait databases to understand pressing environmental issues.",10.1111/gcb.13174,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability",

In this study, we generated an experimental data set of delta(15)N and delta(13)C enrichment means for 22 terrestrial herbivorous arthropods feeding on 18 different host plants. Mean enrichments observed across a single trophic transfer (plants to herbivores) were -0.53 +/- 0.26% for delta(13)C (range: -3.47% to 1.89%) and 1.88 +/- 0.37% for delta(15)N (range: -0.20% to 6.59%). The mean delta(13)C enrichment was significantly lower than that reported in recent literature surveys, whereas the mean delta(15)N enrichment was not significantly different. The experimental data set provided no support for recent hypotheses advanced to explain variation in enrichment values, including the proposed roles for consumer feeding mode, development type, and diet C:N ratio. A larger data set, formed by combining our experimental data with data from the literature, did suggest possible roles for feeding mode, nitrogen recycling, herbivore life stage, and host plant type. Our results indicate that species enrichment values are variable even in this relatively narrow defined group of organisms and that our ability to predict enrichment values of terrestrial herbivorous arthropods based on physiological, ecological, or taxonomic traits is low. The primary implications are that (1) mean enrichment may have to be measured empirically for each trophic link of interest, rather than relying on estimates from a broad survey of animal taxa and (2) the advantage of using stable isotope analysis to probe animal communities that are recalcitrant to other modes of study will be somewhat diminished as a consequence.",10.1007/s00442-005-0170-9,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Spencer, Ricky-John; Janzen, Fredric J.",2010,Demographic consequences of adaptive growth and the ramifications for conservation of long-lived organisms,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Understanding how organisms respond to human impacts is increasingly challenging biologists. Short-lived organisms can adapt rapidly to changes in environmental hazards, but only recently have long-lived organisms been shown to adapt to human impacts. Changes in any life-history trait, such as individual growth rates, may affect demographic model predictions and reliability of elasticity analyses that are often used to help manage and conserve long-lived organisms. The aim of this study was to test model predictions of the effect of increased recruitment and density-dependent processes to manage populations of long-lived turtles in two continents. We explored how human-induced changes in juvenile density affect population growth estimates and the strength of selection on stage-based life-history traits. Model projections undervalued the potential effect of an increase in nest survival. Sensitivity calculations indicated greatest selection intensities for juvenile growth or maturation, whereas elasticity analyses indicated that changes in adult survival have the largest proportional effect on population fitness. Long-term use of the locality of our North American population as a recreational site may have increased adult mortality of turtles and reduced the number of nest predators, inducing rapid individual growth and early maturation. The traditional static view of turtle life history and demography thus is inappropriate even over relatively short periods of time. Anthropogenically-induced changes in demographic processes can potentially induce adaptive changes to life-history processes, which can seriously impact the reliability of long-term projections from common demographic models. Management practices must account for this dynamism accordingly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.biocon.2010.04.034,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Understanding 'Why a prey is a prey for a given predator?' can be facilitated through trait-based approaches that identify linkages between prey and predator morphological and ecological characteristics and highlight key functions involved in prey selection. 2. Enhanced understanding of the functional relationships between predators and their prey is now essential to go beyond the traditional taxonomic framework of dietary studies and to improve our knowledge of ecosystem functioning for wildlife conservation and management. 3. We test the relevance of a three-matrix approach in foraging ecology among a marine mammal community in the northeast Atlantic to identify the key functional traits shaping prey selection processes regardless of the taxonomy of both the predators and prey. 4. Our study reveals that prey found in the diet of marine mammals possess functional traits which are directly and significantly linked to predator characteristics, allowing the establishment of a functional typology of marine mammal-prey relationships. We found prey selection of marine mammals was primarily shaped by physiological and morphological traits of both predators and prey, confirming that energetic costs of foraging strategies and muscular performance are major drivers of prey selection in marine mammals. 5. We demonstrate that trait-based approaches can provide a new definition of the resource needs of predators. This framework can be used to anticipate bottom-up effects on marine predator population dynamics and to identify predators which are sensitive to the loss of key prey functional traits when prey availability is reduced.",10.1111/1365-2656.12218,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Marine,Multiple,Continental Shelf,1,1,1,1,1,Multiple,4,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body length, body mass, frontal surface, spine, fineness ratio, photophores, colour, rostrum, # of teeth on lower mandibular, skeleton, mobility, differentiated teeth YS, water content, protein content, lipid content, baleen plates, echolocation, cibrissae, school size, max swmmin speed, sustainable swimming speed, ash content, energy density, horizontal habitat, vertical habitat, diel migration, seasonal migration, depth, diving capability, muscle mitochondrial density, muscle lipid content",
"Squire, GR; Hawes, C; Begg, GS; Young, MW",2009,Cumulative impact of GM herbicide-tolerant cropping on arable plants assessed through species-based and functional taxonomies,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"In a gradualist approach to the introduction of crop biotechnology, the findings of experimentation at one scale are used to predict the outcome of moving to a higher scale of deployment. Movement through scales had occurred for certain genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops in the UK as far as large-scale field trials. However, the land area occupied by these trials was still < 1% of the area occupied by the respective non-GM crops. Some means is needed to predict the direction and size of the effect of increasing the area of GMHT cropping on ecological variables such as the diversity among species and trophic interactions. Species-accumulation curves are examined here as a method of indicating regional-scale impacts on botanical diversity from multiple field experiments. Data were used from experiments on the effect of (GMHT) crops and non-GM, or conventional, comparators in fields sown with four crop types (beet, maize, spring and winter oilseed rape) at a total of 250 sites in the UK between 2000 and 2003. Indices of biodiversity were measured in a split-field design comparing GMHT with the farmers' usual weed management. In the original analyses based on the means at site level, effects were detected on the mass of weeds in the three spring crops and the proportion of broadleaf and grass weeds in winter oilseed rape, but not on indices of plant species diversity. To explore the links between site means and total taxa, accumulation curves were constructed based on the number of plant species (a pool of around 250 species in total) and the number of plant functional types (24), inferred from the general life-history characteristics of a species. Species accumulation differed between GMHT and conventional treatments in direction and size, depending on the type of crop and its conventional management. Differences were mostly in the asymptote of the curve, indicative of the maximum number of species found in a treatment, rather than the steepness of the curve. In winter oilseed rape, 8% more species were accumulated in the GMHT treatment, mainly as a result of the encouragement of grass species by the herbicide when applied in the autumn. (Overall, GMHT winter oilseed rape had strong negative effects on both the food web and the potential weed burden by increasing the biomass of grasses and decreasing that of broadleaf weeds.) In maize, 33% more species-a substantial increase-were accumulated in the GMHT than in the conventional, consistent with the latter's highly suppressive weed management using triazine herbicides. In the spring oilseed rape and beet, fewer species (around 10%) were accumulated in the GMHT than the conventional. The GMHT treatments did not remove or add any functional (life history) types, however. Differences in species accumulation between treatments appeared to be caused by loss or gain of rarer species. The generality of this effect was confirmed by simulations of species accumulation in which the species complement at each of 50 sites was drawn from a regional pool and subjected to reducing treatment at each site. Shifts in the species-accumulation parameters, comparable to those measured, occurred only when a treatment removed the rarer species at each site. Species accumulation provided a set of simple curve-parameters that captured the net result of numerous local effects of treatments on plant species and, in some instances, the balance between grass and broadleaf types. The direction of effect was not the same in the four crops and depended on the severity of the conventional treatment and on complex interactions between season, herbicide and crop. The accumulation curves gave an indication of potential positive or negative consequences for regional species pools of replacing a conventional practice with GMHT weed management. In this and related studies, a range of indicators, through which diversity was assessed by both species and functional type, and at both site and regional scales, gave more insight into effects of GMHT treatment than provided by any one indicator. Species accumulation was shown to discriminate at the regional scale between agronomic treatments that had little effect on species number at the field scale. While a comprehensive assessment of GM cropping needs to include an examination of regional effects, as here, the costs of doing this in all instances would be prohibitive. Simulations of diversity-reducing treatments could provide a theoretical framework for predicting the likely regional effects from in-field plant dynamics. Accumulation curves potentially offer a means of linking within-site effects to regional impacts on biodiversity resulting from any change in agricultural practice. To guide empirical measurement, there is a scope to apply a methodology such as individual-based modelling at the field scale to explore the links between agronomic treatments and the relative abundance of plant types. The framework needs to be validated in practice, using species-based and functional taxonomies, the latter defined by measured rather than inferred traits.",10.1007/s11356-008-0072-6,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Srinivasan, U; Raza, RH; Quader, S",2010,The nuclear question: rethinking species importance in multi-species animal groups,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"P>1. Animals group for various benefits, and may form either simple single-species groups, or more complex multi-species associations. Multi-species groups are thought to provide anti-predator and foraging benefits to participant individuals. 2. Despite detailed studies on multi-species animal groups, the importance of species in group initiation and maintenance is still rated qualitatively as 'nuclear' (maintaining groups) or 'attendant' (species following nuclear species) based on species-specific traits. This overly simplifies and limits understanding of inherently complex associations, and is biologically unrealistic, because species roles in multi-species groups are: (i) likely to be context-specific and not simply a fixed species property, and (ii) much more variable than this dichotomy indicates. 3. We propose a new view of species importance (measured as number of inter-species associations), along a continuum from 'most nuclear' to 'least nuclear'. Using mixed-species bird flocks from a tropical rainforest in India as an example, we derive inter-species association measures from randomizations on bird species abundance data (which takes into account species 'availability') and data on 86 mixed-species flocks from two different flock types. Our results show that the number and average strength of inter-species associations covary positively, and we argue that species with many, strong associations are the most nuclear. 4. From our data, group size and foraging method are ecological and behavioural traits of species that best explain nuclearity in mixed-species bird flocks. Parallels have been observed in multi-species fish shoals, in which group size and foraging method, as well as diet, have been shown to correlate with nuclearity. Further, the context in which multi-species groups occur, in conjunction with species-specific traits, influences the role played by a species in a multi-species group, and this highlights the importance of extrinsic factors in shaping species importance. 5. Our view of nuclearity provides predictive power in examining species roles in a variety of situations (e.g. predicting leadership in differently composed communities), and can be applied to examine a broad range of ecological and evolutionary questions pertinent to multi-species groups in general.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01707.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Standish, Rachel J.; Gove, Aaron D.; Daws, Matthew I.; Renton, Michael",2018,Nestedness patterns reveal impacts of reduced rainfall on seedling establishment in restored jarrah forest,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Directional climate change can potentially cause a nested pattern of species occurrences as species move or go extinct. That is, species-poor communities may become a nested subset of species-rich communities. There is a precedent for understanding these patterns in the context of historical climate change but few researchers have studied these patterns in the context of recent changes to climate. Here we show the value of nestedness analyses for understanding plant community responses to reduced annual rainfall using data on seedling establishment in restored jarrah forest between the years of 1992 and 2010. Specifically, we recorded the annual seedling establishment of species assemblages in plots 15 months after restoration. We tested to what extent jarrah-forest assemblages that established in low (< 1000 mm) rainfall years were nested within assemblages that established in years of moderate (1000-1200 mm) and high (> 1200 mm) rainfall, and whether assemblages established following lower standard restoration practice were nested subsets of those following higher standard practices. We also tested how both types of nestedness patterns varied among trait groups defined by status (i.e., native or non-native), life-form and seed size. We found high support for species and trait assemblages that established in dry years being a nested subset of assemblages that established in years of moderate rainfall, and consistently low support for nestedness of high in low, and moderate in low, rainfall years. Nestedness patterns associated with restoration practice were as we predicted. Recruitment failure in low rainfall years was the most parsimonious explanation for nestedness patterns associated with rainfall (i.e., selective environmental tolerance). Nestedness patterns associated with restoration practice were explained by differential seed dispersal of species via topsoil and their tolerance of inferior restoration practice. Taken together, we demonstrate the application of the nestedness approach for understanding community responses to climate change in a restoration context. Indeed, generalising species responses to climate change by linking these to ecological processes and traits will help to meet the current global demand for forest restoration. Therefore, we anticipate our findings will interest practitioners working to restore the world's forests under climate change.",10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.006,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Seasonal Tropical Forest,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"traits = native/non-native, life form, seed size",
"Stanley, SM",2007,An analysis of the history of marine animal diversity,PALEOBIOLOGY,"According to when they attained high diversity, major taxa of marine animals have been clustered into three groups, the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern Faunas. Because the Cambrian Fauna was a relatively minor component of the total fauna after mid-Ordovician time, the Phanerozoic history of marine animal diversity is largely a matter of the fates of the Paleozoic and Modern Faunas. The fact that most late Cenozoic genera belong to taxa that have been radiating for tens of millions of years indicates that the post-Paleozoic increase in diversity indicated by fossil data is real, rather than an artifact of improvement of the fossil record toward the present. Assuming that ecological crowding produced the so-called Paleozoic plateau for family diversity, various workers have used the logistic equation of ecology to model marine animal diversification as damped exponential increase. Several lines of evidence indicate that this procedure is inappropriate. A plot of the diversity of marine animal genera through time provides better resolution than the plot for families and has a more jagged appearance. Generic diversity generally increased rapidly during the Paleozoic, except when set back by pulses of mass extinction. In fact, an analysis of the history of the Paleozoic Fauna during the Paleozoic Era reveals no general correlation between rate of increase for this fauna and total marine animal diversity. Furthermore, realistically scaled logistic simulations do not mimic the empirical pattern. In addition, it is difficult to imagine how some fixed limit for diversity could have persisted throughout the Paleozoic Era, when the ecological structure of the marine ecosystem was constantly changing. More fundamentally, the basic idea that competition can set a limit for marine animal diversity is incompatible with basic tenets of marine ecology: predation, disturbance, and vagaries of recruitment determine local population sizes for most marine species. Sparseness of predators probably played a larger role than weak competition in elevating rates of diversification during the initial (Ordovician) radiation of marine animals and during recoveries from mass extinctions. A plot of diversification against total diversity for these intervals yields a band of points above the one representing background intervals, and yet this band also displays no significant trend (if the two earliest intervals of the initial Ordovician are excluded as times of exceptional evolutionary innovation). Thus, a distinctive structure characterized the marine ecosystem during intervals of evolutionary radiation-one in which rates of diversification were exceptionally high and yet increases in diversity did not depress rates of diversification. Particular marine taxa exhibit background rates of origination and extinction that rank similarly when compared with those of other taxa. Rates are correlated in this way because certain heritable traits influence probability of speciation and probability of extinction in similar ways. Background rates of origination and extinction were depressed during the late Paleozoic ice age for all major marine invertebrate taxa, but remained correlated. Also, taxa with relatively high background rates of extinction experienced exceptionally heavy losses during biotic crises because background rates of extinction were intensified in a multiplicative manner; decimation of a large group of taxa of this kind in the two Permian mass extinctions established their collective identity as the Paleozoic Fauna. Characteristic rates of origination and extinction for major taxa persisted from Paleozoic into post-Paleozoic time. Because of the causal linkage between rates of origination and extinction, pulses of extinction tended to drag down overall rates of origination as well as overall rates of extinction by preferentially eliminating higher taxa having relatively high background rates of extinction. This extinction/origination ratchet depressed turnover rates for the residual Paleozoic Fauna during the Mesozoic Era. A decline of this fauna's extinction rate to approximately that of the Modern Fauna accounts for the nearly equal fractional losses experienced by the two faunas in the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction. Viewed arithmetically, the fossil record indicates slow diversification for the Modern Fauna during Paleozoic time, followed by much more rapid expansion during Mesozoic and Cenozoic time. When viewed more appropriately as depicting geometric-or exponential-increase, however, the empirical pattern exhibits no fundamental secular change: the background rate of increase for the Modern Fauna-the fauna that dominated post-Paleozoic marine diversity-simply persisted, reflecting the intrinsic origination and extinction rates of constituent taxa. Persistence of this overall background rate supports other evidence that the empirical record of diversification for marine animal life since Paleozoic time represents actual exponential increase. This enduring rate makes it unnecessary to invoke environmental change to explain the post-Paleozoic increase of marine diversity. Because of the resilience of intrinsic rates, an empirically based simulation that entails intervals of exponential increase for the Paleozoic and Modern Faunas, punctuated by mass extinctions, yields a pattern that is remarkably similar to the empirical pattern. It follows that marine animal genera and species will continue to diversify exponentially long into the future, barring disruption of the marine ecosystem by human-induced or natural environmental changes.",10.1666/06020.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Stanton, ML",2003,Interacting guilds: Moving beyond the pairwise perspective on mutualisms,AMERICAN NATURALIST,"Most textbook treatments imply, and almost all theoretical analyses assume, that mutualistic interactions take place between a single pair of interacting partner species. A major goal of this symposium is to broaden and shift this pairwise perspective and make it concordant with the emerging view that locally exclusive mutualisms between just two species are the exception and that many communities include guilds of mutualistic species on one or both sides of the interaction. Many pollination and seed-dispersal mutualisms have long been recognized as diffuse, but recent molecular analyses are revealing unrecognized partner diversity in mutualistic interactions previously thought to be locally species specific. Co-occurring species within a mutualist guild are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent in the way they locate, compete for, and/or reward partners, and so intraguild interactions have the potential to influence population dynamics and patterns of selection in species on both sides of the mutualistic interaction. To illustrate some of these potential complexities for population dynamics, I use simple path analytic models to show that positive pairwise interactions between mutualists do not necessarily translate into positive net interactions within a mutualism involving more than two species. For example, when there is intraguild competition for partners, or even for resources external to the mutualism, the presence of a lower-quality mutualist can negatively affect the partner population by reducing associations it can form with better mutualists. Variation in quality among potential partners is likely to place a premium on traits or behaviors that enhance association with better mutualists. More investigations are needed to determine how variation among interacting mutualists, with respect to characteristics such as longevity, dispersal capability, and competitive ability, influence population dynamics and selection in multispecies mutualisms.",10.1086/378646,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

An underlying assumption is that individual-based toxicity metrics for one species can be directly compared with that for another species. However, this assumption overlooks the fact that different species have different life-history strategies and variables, such as lifespan, time to first reproduction, and number of offspring produced over a lifetime. Using a simple model and laboratory-derived parameter values, we tested the impact of differences in life-history traits on predicted responses to stress. The model predicts the delay in population growth. We compared seven invertebrate species by imposing 50% chronic mortality, 50% reduction of offspring, and both of these effects. The mode predicted substantial differences in population delay among a : of the species. Furthermore, the intrinsic rate of increase of each population was negatively correlated with the delay in population growth; species with high intrinsic rates of increase were less susceptible to equal levels of stress than species with lower intrinsic rates of increase. These results suggest that the susceptibility of species to pollutants is more complicated than previously thought and that differences in life-history variables must be considered in analyses of population persistence for threatened and endangered species.",10.1073/pnas.0304903101,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, ecologists are often faced with large suites of potentially important traits, making generalizations across ecosystems and species difficult or even impossible. Here, we hypothesize that key traits structuring ecological communities may be causally dependent on common physiological mechanisms and that elucidating these mechanisms can help us understand the distributions of traits and species across habitats. We test this hypothesis by investigating putatively causal relationships between physiological and behavioral traits at the species and community levels in larvae of 17 species of dragonfly that co-occur at the landscape scale but segregate among lakes. We use tools borrowed from phenotypic selection analyses to show that physiological traits underlie activity rate, which has opposing effects on foraging and predator avoidance behaviors. The effect of activity on these behaviors ultimately shapes species distributions and community composition in habitats with either large-bodied fish or invertebrates as top predators. Remarkably, despite the inherent complexity of ecological communities, the expression of just two biomolecules accounts for a high proportion of the variation in behavioral traits and hence, dragonfly community composition between habitats.

However, such mutual relations between these disciplines are constrained by traditional focuses on different operational scales: taxonomists are more familiar with large scales (e.g., global, continental, many species of a given clade), whereas ecologists are more familiar with small scales (regional, ecosystems, habitats, few species of a given clade). To foster mutually fruitful, 2-way exchanges between taxonomy and ecology at such smaller scales requires assessments of the small-scale performance of taxonomic practices so far used at larger scales. Such assessments are the objective of this study. To combine quantified ecology and phylogeny at the smaller scale, we designed a research project using 9 species of Hydropsyche (Trichoptera) from the Loire River (i.e., we focus on the regional scale). Here, we tried to unravel the phylogenetic relationships of this regional set of species using (1) many different characters (molecular and morphological characters of larvae and adults), (2) taxonomic congruence instead of total evidence (as the former provides more opportunities for future research on links between different data sets), and (3) an explicit data matrix and analysis methods that are commonly recommended for phylogenetic studies (e. g., maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, bootstrapping), and we also included traditional, parsimonious, phylogenetic reasoning. Combining these elements, we obtained the following information for the regional Hydropsyche representatives from the Loire: (1) phylogenetic clusters of the species, (2) phylogenetic distances among the species, and (3) phylogenetic polarities of characters (plesio- to apomorphies) in the species tree. For our future ecological studies, this will enable (1) establishment of priorities in species selections for experimental approaches, (2) establishment of relationships between ecological and phylogenetic distances, and (3) interpretation of ecological response gradients across the species in the context of evolutionary processes such as adaptation, niche conservatism, or fitness.

Functional traits are the primary biotic component driving organism influence on ecosystem functions; in consequence, traits are widely used in ecological research. However, most animal trait-based studies use easy-to-measure characteristics of species that are at best only weakly associated with functions. Animal-mediated pollination is a key ecosystem function and is likely to be influenced by pollinator traits, but to date no one has identified functional traits that are simple to measure and have good predictive power.Methods. Here, we show that a simple, easy to measure trait (hairiness) can predict pollinator effectiveness with high accuracy. We used a novel image analysis method to calculate entropy values for insect body surfaces as a measure of hairiness. We evaluated the power of our method for predicting pollinator effectiveness by regressing pollinator hairiness (entropy) against single visit pollen deposition (SVD) and pollen loads on insects We used linear models and AICe model selection to determine which body regions were the best predictors of SVD and pollen load.Results. We found that hairiness can be fused as a robust proxy of SVD.

The best model for predicting pollen load for B. rapa was hairiness on the face (R-2 = 0.81).Discussion. We suggest that the match between pollinator body region hairiness and plant reproductive structure morphology is a powerful predictor of pollinator effectiveness.

Past work showed that host phylogenetic relatedness and geographical proximity can increase cross-species transmission, but further work is needed to examine the importance of host traits, and species interactions such as predation, in determining the degree to which parasites are shared between hosts. Here we consider the factors that predict patterns of parasite sharing across a diverse assemblage of 116 wild ungulates (i.e., hoofed mammals in the Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla) and nearly 900 species of micro- and macroparasites, controlling for differences in total parasite richness and host sampling effort. We also consider the effects of trophic links on parasite sharing between ungulates and carnivores. We tested for the relative influence of range overlap, phylogenetic distance, body mass, and ecological dissimilarity (i.e., the distance separating species in a Euclidean distance matrix based on standardized traits) on parasite sharing. We also tested for the effects of variation in study effort as a potential source of bias in our data, and tested whether carnivores reported to feed on ungulates have more ungulate parasites than those that use other resources. As in other groups, geographical range overlap and phylogenetic similarity predicted greater parasite community similarity in ungulates. Ecological dissimilarity showed a weak negative relationship with parasite sharing. Counter to our expectations, differences, not similarity, in host body mass predicted greater parasite sharing between pairs of ungulate hosts. Pairs of well-studied host species showed higher overlap than poorly studied species, although including sampling effort did not reduce the importance of biological traits in our models. Finally, carnivores that feed on ungulates harboured a greater richness of ungulate helminths. Overall, we show that the factors that predict parasite sharing in wild ungulates are similar to those known for other mammal groups, and demonstrate the importance of controlling for heterogeneity in host sampling effort in future analyses of parasite sharing. We also show that ecological interactions, in this case trophic links via predation, can allow sharing of some parasite species among distantly related host species.",10.1111/1365-2656.12987,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

These trait-mediated indirect effects may change in direction or intensity during growth or, in sexually dimorphic species, between the sexes. The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata presents a unique opportunity to examine these interactions; its behavioral ecology has been intensively studied in wild populations with well-characterized predator faunas. Predation pressure is known to have driven the evolution of many guppy traits; for example, in high-predation sites, females (but not males) tend to shoal, and this anti-predator behavior facilitates parasite transmission. To test for evidence of predator-driven differences in infection in natural populations, we collected 4715 guppies from 62 sites across Trinidad between 2003 and 2009 and screened them for ectosymbionts, including Gyrodactylus. A novel model-averaging analysis revealed that females were more likely to be infected with Gyrodactylus parasites than males, but only in populations with both high predation pressure and high infection prevalence. We propose that the difference in shoaling tendency between the sexes could explain the observed difference in infection prevalence between males and females in high-predation sites. The infection rate of juveniles did not vary with predation regime, probably because juveniles face constant predation pressure from conspecific adults and therefore tend to shoal in both high- and low-predation sites. This represents the first evidence for age- and sex-specific trait-mediated indirect effects of predators on the probability of infection in their prey.",10.1890/14-0495.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Sterck, F; Markesteijn, L; Toledo, M; Schieving, F; Poorter, L",2014,Sapling performance along resource gradients drives tree species distributions within and across tropical forests,ECOLOGY,"Niche differentiation is a major hypothesized determinant of species distributions, but its practical importance is heavily debated and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Trait-based approaches have been used to infer niche differentiation and predict species distributions. For understanding underlying mechanisms, individual traits should be scaled up to whole-plant performance, which has rarely been done. We measured seven key traits that are important for carbon and water balance for 37 tropical tree species. We used a process-based plant physiological model to simulate the carbon budget of saplings along gradients of light and water availability, and quantified the performance of the species in terms of their light compensation points (a proxy for shade tolerance), water compensation points (proxy for drought tolerance), and maximum carbon gain rates (proxy for potential growth rate). We linked species performances to their observed distributions (the realized niches) at two spatial scales in Bolivian lowland forests: along a canopy openness gradient at local scale (similar to 1 km 2) and along a rainfall gradient (1100-2200 mm/yr) at regional (similar to 1000 km) scale. We show that the water compensation point was the best predictor of species distributions along water and light resource gradients within and across tropical forests. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the stomatal regulation of minimum leaf water potentials, rather than stem hydraulic traits (sapwood area and specific conductivity), contributed to the species differences in the water compensation point of saplings. The light compensation point and maximum carbon gain, both driven by leaf area index and leaf nitrogen concentration, also contributed to differential species distributions at the local scale, but not or only marginally at the regional scale. Trait-and-physiology-based simulations of whole-plant performance thus help to evaluate the possible roles of individual traits in physiological processes underlying species performance along environmental gradients. The development of such whole-plant concepts will improve our ability to understand responses of plant communities to shifts in resource availability and stress under global change.",10.1890/13-2377.1,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,1,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = crown leaf area index, leaf mass per leaf area, leaf N concentration, stem sapwood area, wood density, sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity and the minimum leaf water potential ",

Several methods of macroinvertebrate analyses, including the use of taxonomic groupings, are used to ascertain information regarding stream biodiversity and health. The use of biological traits to group and analyse macroinvertebrate communities, however, may provide a better picture of stream health, particularly in ephemeral streams. To address whether this is the case, three ephemeral systems in the lower Fitzroy catchment, Central Queensland, Australia, were studied over an 18-month period. A total of 69 macroinvertebrate families from 14 orders were collected in 128 samples. Taxonomic analysis indicated there was a range of habitat preferences within groups characterized by a large proportion of tolerant and generalist taxa. The macroinvertebrate communities were categorised into biological trait groups, with a number of predator families found during all flow regimes. A general pattern of Gatherer > Predator > Grazer > Shredder > Filterer was observed. This study provides a clear pattern of the biological traits present during variable flow and could be used as a framework for future stream health modelling.

It is also a highly complex trait controlled by dozens of genes. Understanding the selective pressures influencing time to flowering, and being able to reliably predict how it will evolve in novel environments, are unsolved challenges for plant evolutionary geneticists. Using the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined the impact of simulated high and low winter precipitation levels on the flowering time of naturalized lines from across the eastern portion of the introduced North American range, and the fitness consequences of early versus late flowering. Flowering time order was significantly correlated across two environments-in a previous common garden experiment and in environmental chambers set to mimic mid-range photoperiod and temperature conditions. Plants in low water flowered earlier, had fewer basal branches and produced fewer fruits. Selection in both treatments favored earlier flowering and more basal branches. Our analyses revealed an interaction between flowering time and water treatment for fitness, where flowering later was more deleterious for fitness in the low water treatment. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in winter precipitation levels are one of the selective agents underlying a flowering time cline in introduced A. thaliana populations.",10.7717/peerj.898,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The plant vigor and stress hypotheses provide a theoretical framework for understanding how arthropods respond to stress, but are rarely tested at the community level. Following a record drought, we compared the communities of arthropods on pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) that exhibited a gradient in physical traits related to environmental stress (e.g., growth rate, branch dieback, and needle retention). Six patterns emerged that show how one of the predicted outcomes of climate change in the southwestern USA (i.e., increased drought severity) alters the communities of a foundation tree species. In accordance with the plant vigor hypothesis, increasing tree stress was correlated with an eight to tenfold decline in arthropod species richness and abundance. Trees that were more similar in their level of stress had more similar arthropod communities. Both foliage quantity and quality contributed to arthropod community structure. Individual species and feeding groups differed in their responses to plant stress, but most were negatively affected. Arthropod richness (r (2) = 0.48) and abundance (r (2) = 0.48) on individual trees were positively correlated with the tree's radial growth during drought. This relationship suggests that tree ring analysis may be used as a predictor of arthropod diversity, which is similar to findings with ectomycorrhizal fungi. A contrast of our findings on arthropod abundance with published data on colonization by mutualistic fungi on the same trees demonstrates that at low stress these two communities respond differently, but at high stress both are negatively affected. These results suggest that the effect of extreme climatic events such as drought on foundation tree species are likely to decrease multi-trophic diversity and shift arthropod community composition, which in turn could cascade to affect other associated taxa.",10.1007/s00442-010-1684-3,y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,,"traits = growth rate, branch dieback, needle retention",

Species with a combination of short stature and large seed had a relatively greater competitive ability in low compared to high fertility treatments. Analysis of survey data from the Broadbalk long-term experiment confirmed that, as N inputs increased, the abundance of the two functional groups that contained only common species remained stable or increased; whereas, the groups dominated by rare or threatened species declined as fertility increased.

A weed traits database (WTDB) was designed, populated and analysed, initially using data for 19 common European weeds, to begin to consolidate trait data in a single repository. The initial choice of traits was driven by the requirements of empirical models of weed population dynamics to identify correlations between traits and model parameters. These relationships were used to build a generic model, operating at the level of functional traits, to simulate the impact of increasing herbicide and fertiliser use on virtual weeds along gradients of seed weight and maximum height. The model generated fitness contours' (defined as population growth rates) within this trait space in different scenarios, onto which two sets of weed species, defined as common or declining in the UK, were mapped.

Classically, the niche was described as an n-dimensional hypervolume where each dimension represents a biotic or abiotic characteristic. More recently, it has been hypothesised that a single dimension may be sufficient to explain the system-level organization of trophic interactions observed between species in a community. 2. Here, we test the hypothesis that species body mass is that single dimension. Specifically, we determine how the intervality of food webs ordered by body size compares to that of randomly ordered food webs. We also extend this analysis beyond the community level to the effect of body mass in explaining the diets of individual species. 3. We conclude that body mass significantly explains the ordering of species and the contiguity of diets in empirical communities. 4. At the species-specific level, we find that the degree to which body mass is a significant explanatory variable depends strongly on the phylogenetic history, suggesting that other evolutionarily conserved traits partly account for species' roles in the food web. 5.

The structure of amphipod assemblages based on density data was patchy at all spatial scales investigated, but differed markedly among protection levels.

Furthermore, P. oceanica meadow features (shoot density, leaf and epiphyte biomasses, coefficient A and litter biomass) accounted for only a low proportion of the total variability.

Alien species were more likely to be recorded as successfully introduced if they were commonly for sale in the Taiwanese pet bird trade, and possessed songs considered to be more attractive to people. Species that have been sold in the pet market for a longer period were also more likely to have been recorded in the wild. Establishment success was more likely for large-bodied bird species, but not strongly related to other predicted determinants of success, including proxies for propagule pressure and climate matching.

Two often untested assumptions of these models, however, are that species traits can reliably predict species' broadscale distribution and that the effects of traits on community membership do not vary between restored and remnant habitats. The goals of this study were to determine whether combinations of ecological traits predispose moth species toward recolonization of restored prairies and to assess the degree to which restored prairies contain moth assemblages comparable with prairie remnants. In 2004, we collected 259 moth species from 13 tallgrass prairie remnants and restorations in central Iowa. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify significant combinations of ecological traits that were shared by groups of moth species. Logistic regression was then employed to test for significant effects of the trait combinations on the frequency of prairie sites occupied by moth species. PCA partitioned moth traits into four axes that explained a total of 81.6% of the variance. Logistic regression detected significant effects for all four PCA axes on the fraction of sites occupied by moths. Species frequently filtered from the regional species pool into prairies were those that had long flight periods and were multivoltine, displayed a feeding preference for legumes but not other forb families, and were regionally abundant but relatively small in body size. Ordination revealed significant differences in moth communities among prairies, suggesting that species traits and habitat characteristics likely interact to create observed patterns of species recolonization of restorations.

We used open pollination and pollinator-exclusion environments to examine pollinator mediated selection and selection for autonomous selfing in six gene-pools of Vicia faba over three consecutive years. We recorded, by using Digital Image Analysis, functional floral traits related to attraction, sexual dimension, and vector matching/pollen transfer efficiency. Nine production components were measured to categorize seed production patterns. Our approach used a series of Multivariate Regression Analyses (MRA) to explore which floral traits provided the best models to explain seed production patterns in each gene-pool and pollination environment. MRA showed that variation in the incidence of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits or in the selection for autonomous selfing can substantially contribute to differences in seed patterns. The underlying floral mechanisms are specific to the gene-pool and largely unrelated among gene-pools. Consistent results among gene-pools involved no evidence of pollinator-mediated selection as result of the floral traits under study on the main predictors of crop yield, pods and seeds per plant. However, relevant predictors of crop yield such as pod length and seed dimensions and weight were pollinator-dependent because of pollinator-mediated selection on sexual dimension, floral display and vector matching traits.

In order to examine the impact of filament formation on population dynamics, we developed an experimental system with a filamentous bacterium Flectobacillus sp. MWH38 and a ciliate predator Tetrahymena pyriformis. In this system, the effective defense of Flectobacillus resulted in the extinction of Tetrahymena by allowing almost no population growth. The result of a kairomone experiment suggested the existence of chemical signals for filament formation. To examine the mechanism further, we developed a quantitative mechanistic model and optimized the model for the experimental result using the simulated annealing method. We also performed a global parameter sensitivity analysis using an approximated Bayesian computation based on the sequential Monte Carlo method to reveal parameters to which the model behavior is sensitive to. Our model reproduced the population dynamics, as well as the cell size dynamics of Flectobacillus.

"Svartberg, K",2005,A comparison of behaviour in test and in everyday life: evidence of three consistent boldness-related personality traits in dogs,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,"Six specific personality traits - playfulness, chase-proneness, curiosity/fearlessness, sociability, aggressiveness, and distance-playfulness - and a broad boldness dimension have been suggested for dogs in previous studies based on data collected in a standardized behavioural test (""dog mentality assessment"", DMA). In the present study I investigated the validity of the specific traits for predicting typical behaviour in everyday life. A questionnaire with items describing the dog's typical behaviour in a range of situations was sent to owners of dogs that had carried out the DMA behavioural test 1-2 years earlier. Of the questionnaires that were sent out 697 were returned, corresponding to a response rate of 73.3%. Based on factor analyses on the questionnaire data, behavioural factors in everyday life were suggested to correspond to the specific personality traits from the DMA. Correlation analyses suggested construct validity for the traits playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, sociability, and distance-playfulness. Chase-proneness, which I expected to be related to predatory behaviour in everyday life, was instead related to human-directed play interest and nonsocial fear. Aggressiveness was the only trait from the DMA with low association to all of the behavioural factors from the questionnaire. The results suggest that three components of dog personality are measured in the DMA: (1) interest in playing with humans; (2) attitude towards strangers (interest in, fear of, and aggression towards); and (3) non-social fearfulness. These three components correspond to the traits playfulness, sociability, and curiosity/fearlessness, respectively, all of which were found to be related to a higher-order shyness-boldness dimension. Chase-proneness and distance-playfulness seem to be mixed measures of these personality components, and are not related to any additional components. Since the time between the behavioural test and the questionnaire was 1-2 years, the results indicate long-term consistency of the personality components. Based on these results, the DMA seems to be useful in predicting behavioural problems that are related to social and non-social fear, but not in predicting other potential behavioural problems. However, considering this limitation, the test seems to validly assess important aspects of dog personality, which supports the use of the test as an instrument in dog breeding and in selection of individual dogs for different purposes.

Through analysis of body size data and phylogenetic modelling of trait evolution, we recovered an ancestral shift towards sexual dimorphisms in both size and appearance in a lineage of flower-associated praying mantises. Sedentary female flower mantises dramatically increased in size prior to a transition from camouflaged, ambush predation to a floral simulation strategy, gaining access to, and visually attracting, a novel resource: large pollinating insects. Male flower mantises, however, remained small and mobile to facilitate mate-finding and reproductive success, consistent with ancestral male life strategy. Although moderate sexual size dimorphisms are common in many arthropod lineages, the predominant explanation is female size increase for increased fecundity. However, sex-dependent selective pressures acting outside of female fecundity have been suggested as mechanisms behind niche dimorphisms. Our hypothesised role of predatory selection acting on females to generate both extreme sexual size dimorphism coupled with niche dimorphism is novel among arthropods.",10.1038/srep37753,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

J.",2012,Niche models tell half the story: spatial context and life-history traits influence species responses to global change,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aim While niche models are typically used to assess the vulnerability of species to climate change, they have been criticized for their limited assessment of threats other than climate change. We attempt to evaluate this limitation by combining niche models with life-history models to investigate the relative influence of climate change and a range of fire regimes on the viability of a long-lived plant population. Specifically, we investigate whether range shift due to climate change is a greater threat to an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub than altered fire frequency and how these two threatening processes might interact. Location Australian sclerophyll woodland and heathland. Methods The study species is Leucopogon setiger, an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub. A spatially explicit stochastic matrix model was constructed for this species and linked with a dynamic niche model and fire risk functions representing a suite of average fire return intervals. We compared scenarios with a variety of hypothetical patches, a patch framework based upon current habitat suitability and one with dynamic habitat suitability based on climate change scenarios A1FI and A2. Results Leucopogon setiger was found to be sensitive to fire frequency, with shorter intervals reducing expected minimum abundances (EMAs). Spatial decoupling of fires across the landscape reduced the vulnerability of the species to shortened fire frequencies. Shifting habitat, while reducing EMAs, was less of a threat to the species than frequent fire. Main conclusions Altered fire regime, in particular more frequent fires relative to the historical regime, was predicted to be a strong threat to this species, which may reflect a vulnerability of obligate seeders in general. Range shifts induced by climate change were a secondary threat when habitat reductions were predicted. Incorporating life-history traits into habitat suitability models by linking species distribution models with population models allowed for the population-level evaluation of multiple stressors that affect population dynamics and habitat, ultimately providing a greater understanding of the impacts of global change than would be gained by niche models alone. Further investigations of this type could elucidate how particular bioecological factors can affect certain types of species under global change.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02690.x,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Seasonal Tropical Forest,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,traits = fire tolerance  ,

Most community assembly hypotheses consider the relative importance of the ecological similarity of co-occurring species. Quantifying this similarity is a daunting and potentially impossible task in species-rich assemblages. During the past decade tropical tree ecologists have increasingly utilized phylogenetic trees and functional traits to estimate the ecological similarity of species in order to test mechanistic community assembly hypotheses. A large amount of work has resulted with many important advances having been made along the way. That said, there are still many outstanding challenges facing those utilizing phylogenetic and functional trait approaches to study community assembly. Here I review the conceptual background, major advances and major remaining challenges in phylogenetic- and trait-based approaches to community ecology with a specific focus on tropical trees.

The degree to which variability in species function regulates distribution and promotes coexistence of species has been debated. Previous work has attempted to quantify the relative importance of species function by using phylogenetic relatedness as a proxy for functional similarity. The key assumption of this approach is that function is phylogenetically conserved. If this assumption is supported, then the phylogenetic dispersion in a community should mirror the functional dispersion. Here we quantify functional trait dispersion along several key axes of tree life-history variation and on multiple spatial scales in a Neotropical dry-forest community. We next compare these results to previously reported patterns of phylogenetic dispersion in this same forest. We find that, at small spatial scales, coexisting species are typically more functionally clustered than expected, but traits related to adult and regeneration niches are overdispersed. This outcome was repeated when the analyses were stratified by size class. Some of the trait dispersion results stand in contrast to the previously reported phylogenetic dispersion results. In order to address this inconsistency we examined the strength of phylogenetic signal in traits at different depths in the phylogeny. We argue that: (1) while phylogenetic relatedness may be a good general multivariate proxy for ecological similarity, it may have a reduced capacity to depict the functional mechanisms behind species coexistence when coexisting species simultaneously converge and diverge in function; and (2) the previously used metric of phylogenetic signal provided erroneous inferences about trait dispersion when married with patterns of phylogenetic dispersion.",10.1890/08-1025.1,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Seasonal Tropical Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = SLA, leaf succulence, wood specific gravity, max height, seed mass, leaf area",

Genomic and transcriptomic information has been largely leveraged in ecological investigations of primarily model species and their relatives. The amount of infrastructure and financing necessary for such investigations has meant that analyses of assemblages full of non-model species were impossible. These barriers have rapidly eroded over the past few years to the point where community ecology will soon see a large influx of genomic and transcriptomic investigations. The hope is that such studies will greatly refine or even transform our inferences regarding the distribution and co-occurrence of plant species. 2.

Two studies demonstrate of functional phylogenomic approaches that can be used in conjunction with neighbourhood demographic models to understand the role of neighbouring heterospecific species on focal tree demography. Two additional papers demonstrate how genes are differentially expressed in different competitive contexts and how this is related to species coexistence. The final study uses a metabarcoding approach to document whether the incredible levels of soil fungal and tree biodiversity in the tropics are linked. 4. Synthesis.

"Sydenham, MAK; Moe, SR; Totland, O; Eldegard, K",2015,Does multi-level environmental filtering determine the functional and phylogenetic composition of wild bee species assemblages?,ECOGRAPHY,"A central goal in ecology is to develop theories that explain the diversity and distribution of species. The evolutionary history of species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals. Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the northern region than in the southern part of the study region. Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.",10.1111/ecog.00938,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Insects,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits  = body size, nesting behaviour, sociality, phenology, floral specialization, ",

Standard measures of composition are useful in species-based conservation and ecology, but they may be less informative in the context of evolutionary history and functional diversity. Functional and phylogenetic approaches are increasingly used to test mechanisms driving biodiversity patterns. We studied 28 families of flies (Diptera) with a range of functional characteristics in three wetland classes (bogs, swamps, marshes) in Quebec, Canada. We examined taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional structure of communities and assessed whether rarity is deterministic or stochastic. Beta- and phylobeta-diversity were also examined for relatedness to local environmental conditions, patch area, and/or surrounding landscape. Phylogenetic community structure analyses had high value and complementarity to standard measures. Environmental filtering acted on bog communities during assembly, as they emerged from a slow peat accumulation process and the plant composition is characteristic as few species can survive in these acidic and low nutrient conditions. Subsequently, community assembly happened randomly. Neutral processes of community assembly are more important in marshes and swamps, as dispersal limitation explained species abundance dynamics of small and common Diptera species. The assembly of marsh communities is a balance between neutral processes and environmental filtering, while assembly in swamps can be seen as neutral. Clustering increased with environmental extremes, indicating environmental filtering. Rare species tended to be less closely related to common species.

"Takasu, F",2003,Co-evolutionary dynamics of egg appearance in avian brood parasitism,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,"In avian brood parasitism, interactions between parasites and their hosts lead to a co-evolutionary process called an arms race. Field studies have shown that many host species have evolved an ability to recognize and reject parasite eggs that look unlike their own and that some parasites lay eggs of sophisticated mimicry. Egg appearance is a crucial factor that determines the reproductive success both of the parasites and their hosts in the arms race. The appearance of eggs, however, is a quantitative trait and the variation within a population could critically affect the dynamics of the arms race; parasite individuals that lay eggs more similar to those of the host are more likely to reproduce successfully, whereas host individuals that lay eggs more unlike those of the parasite have a better chance of rejecting parasitism and reproducing, which would de-stabilize the parasites' good mimicry. To explore the arms race for egg appearance, I constructed a model described by an integro-difference equation. The temporal change of the 'distributions' of egg appearance along a continuous spectrum was analysed both for the parasite and host populations. The model analyses show that (1) a conventional view of an arms race-'parasites chasing their hosts escaping from the parasites'-is realized in the early stage of the dynamics, but (2) the distributions of egg appearance finally converge to discrete point-distributions (polymorphism) even when any continuous distributions are used as the initial state. The latter might be relevant to the maintenance of polymorphism of egg appearance. Based on the model analysis, I discuss the implications of this model for general (co)evolutionary processes for quantitative traits and suggest a new modelling framework to account for such processes.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Accounting for among-species variation through application of phylogenetic comparative methods is a complementary although little used approach. It enables the direct association of body size values with particular environments. Using phylogenetically explicit comparative analyses, we show that small body size is associated with diurnal (rather than nocturnal) activity of adults among temperate species of the moth family Geometridae. The association of an exclusively adult trait with species-specific body size suggests that optimal body sizes are at least partly determined by the costs being a large adult, as opposed to the more frequently considered costs of attaining large size.

"Tanentzap, AJ; Lee, WG; Schulz, KAC",2013,Niches drive peaked and positive relationships between diversity and disturbance in natural ecosystems,ECOSPHERE,"A unified understanding of the relationship between disturbance and biodiversity is needed to predict biotic responses to global change. Recent advances have identified the need to deconstruct traditional models of disturbance into intensity and frequency to reconcile empirical studies that appear to generate contradictory associations between species diversity and disturbance. We integrate results from theoretical simulation modelling, field-based surveys of 5176 vegetation plots from 48 transects across 6 sites, and experimental pot-based manipulations of flooding to identify how disturbance drives species diversity within ephemeral wetlands in South Island, New Zealand. We find empirical, hump-shaped and positive relationships between species diversity and both disturbance intensity and frequency, mirroring patterns from a simulation model in which species differed in their demographic responses to disturbance. More generally, our simulations show that the relationships between diversity and disturbance shift from positive to hump-shaped to negative as species that are favored at low disturbance because of their resistance strategies, defined by low mortality and recruitment, decline within communities relative to resilient species. Resilient species with higher mortality and recruitment rates are instead favored as disturbance intensity and frequency intensify. Our theoretical findings suggest that sites must also have a third group of unique species with intermediate resilience and resistance. Analyses of community composition along our disturbance gradients support this prediction, emphasizing that shifts in community-level resistance and resilience drive empirical associations between diversity and disturbance. Overall, terrestrial plants may be unable to resist intense and frequent flooding, even with specialized traits. Only fast-growing species with high regeneration from seed may respond once flooding subsides and dominate community composition in these situations, especially on nutrient-rich soils. However, different strategies can co-occur at intermediate disturbance, ultimately increasing species richness. As disturbances become more pervasive globally, our results suggest that differences in the niches of species, rather than demographic stochasticity, drive biodiversity patterns. These niche-based processes may especially prevail, without accompanying losses in species richness, where sites are initially dominated by resistant taxa or life history strategies that balance resistance and resilience.",10.1890/ES13-00102.1,Y,0,1,0,0,1,1,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Wetland,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,Global Change Broad,0,0,1,1,"traits = mortality rate, colonization",

It has the largest known litter size in the order Carnivora. up to 18 young, and litter size is highly variable. We have analysed data From arctic fox populations throughout the species circumpolar range. In some areas, arctic foxes feed on strongly fluctuating populations of small rodents. In contrast, they have more stable food resources at bird cliffs and along coast lines. Food availability determines arctic fos litter and population sizes. A comparison between fluctuating and stable arctic fox populations showed that fluctuations are associated with large litter sizes. There were significant differences in litter size means, maxima and variances, as well as in placental scar count means. We have discussed five hypotheses on the determination of variation in litter size: one energetic, one genetic (based on density variation), one diet-determined, one based on reproductive allocation and one based on differences in reaction norms. Our findings suggest that litter size in the arctic fox is determined by the combined effect of immediate resource levels and the degree of resource predictability. We describe reaction norms that suggest how litter sizes result from adaptive plasticity within each of two genetic strategies where, according to the jackpot hypothesis, populations with unpredictable food resources generally have larger litter sizes. Within each genetic strategy, or reaction norm, litter sizes are adjusted through a number of plastic trails.

It is a physically energetic region with some of the highest levels of productivity in the Southern Ocean. It is also a region within which there have been greater than average levels of change in upper water column temperature. We describe the results of three cruises transecting the central Scotia Sea from south to north in consecutive years and covering spring, summer and autumn periods. We also report on some community level syntheses using both current-day and historical data from this region. A wide range of parameters were measured during the field campaigns, covering the physical oceanography of the region, air-sea CO2 fluxes, macro- and micronutrient concentrations, the composition and biomass of the nano-, micro- and mesoplankton communities, and the distribution and biomass of Antarctic krill and mesopelagic fish. Process studies examined the effect of iron-stress on the physiology of primary producers, reproduction and egestion in Antarctic krill and the transfer of stable isotopes between trophic layers, from primary consumers up to birds and seals. Community level syntheses included an examination of the biomass-spectra, food-web modelling, spatial analysis of multiple trophic layers and historical species distributions. The spatial analyses in particular identified two distinct community types: a northern warmer water community and a southern cold community, their boundary being broadly consistent with the position of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Temperature and ice cover appeared to be the dominant, over-riding factors in driving this pattern. Extensive phytoplankton blooms were a major feature of the surveys, and were persistent in areas such as South Georgia. In situ and bioassay measurements emphasised the important role of iron inputs as facilitators of these blooms. Based on seasonal DIC deficits, the South Georgia bloom was found to contain the strongest seasonal carbon uptake in the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean. The surveys also encountered low-production, iron-limited regions, a situation more typical of the wider Southern Ocean. The response of primary and secondary consumers to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in production was complex. Many of the life-cycles of small pelagic organisms showed a close coupling to the seasonal cycle of food availability. For instance, Antarctic krill showed a dependence on early, non-ice-associated blooms to facilitate early reproduction. Strategies to buffer against environmental variability were also examined, such as the prevalence of multiyear life-cycles and variability in energy storage levels. Such traits were seen to influence the way in which Scotia Sea communities were structured, with biomass levels in the larger size classes being higher than in other ocean regions. Seasonal development also altered trophic function, with the trophic level of higher predators increasing through the course of the year as additional predator-prey interactions emerged in the lower trophic levels. Finally, our studies re-emphasised the role that the simple phytoplankton-krill-higher predator food chain plays in this Southern Ocean region, particularly south of the SACCF. To the north, alternative food chains, such as those involving copepods, macrozooplankton and mesopelagic fish, were increasingly important. Continued ocean warming in this region is likely to increase the prevalence of such alternative suchfood chains with Antarctic krill predicted to move southwards. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The main focus of this review is on how land-use change and soil management can be used to correct this imbalance. Currently, the main terrestrial source for CH4 is from natural wetlands and irrigated rice cultivation; although improvements in water management during rice production have resulted in major reductions of CH4 emissions from this source. Afforestation and reforestation can also enhance soil CH4 oxidation by influencing the composition and activity of the soil methanotroph (aerobic proteobacteria) community. The effects of these and other land-use changes on soil CH4 oxidation are not generally well understood, but are known to influence this process through their effects on a range of soil properties such as soil moisture, nitrogen status, and pH that also affects methanotroph community structure and function.Recent advances in molecular techniques have confirmed the central role of methanotroph communities in regulating soil CH4 consumption by revealing how they respond to land-use change. Community-level molecular analyses of methanotroph populations under different conditions now provide new insights into the distinct traits of the different subgroups and their ecology.These advances in understanding the abiotic and biological processes regulating soil CH4 oxidation now offers the possibility of being able to predict which land-use and management practices, especially for afforestation and reforestation, will achieve high soil CH4 oxidation rates They also improve the prospects for integrated assessment of the atmospheric impacts on the global greenhouse gas budget from net soil emissions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 with land use and management change.

"Tatsumi, S; Cadotte, MW; Mori, AS",2019,Individual-based models of community assembly: Neighbourhood competition drives phylogenetic community structure,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"It is now commonplace for community ecologists to infer assembly processes from the evolutionary relatedness of co-occurring species. Such inferences, however, have typically depended on assembly theories that assume competitive equilibrium and that are species based. In reality, all natural communities are dynamic, particularly during the course of succession, and the ecological interactions which drive phylogenetic community structure actually occur among neighbouring individuals rather than species. To bridge this gap between theory and reality, we examine how colonisation, competition, and consequent replacement of individuals translate into phylogenetic community structure by using an individual-based model. The model we use assumes a trade-off between competition and colonisation abilities and that the points where species fall on the trade-off curve are phylogenetically conserved. We find that the phylogenetic alpha diversity of a given community will be equal to or greater than the null expectation generated by randomly drawing individuals from communities at the same time step (i.e. phylogenetic overdispersion). This pattern results from the combination of interspecific differences in colonisation ability and neighbourhood competition that lead to individuals being regularly distributed in two-dimensional space. We also show that phylogenetic beta diversity increases with increasing temporal differences between two communities. However, when this positive relationship is analysed only among the communities at close time steps, it becomes insignificant as they approach competitive equilibrium. We find similar patterns for functional alpha and beta diversity when phylogeny is replaced with functional traits. Synthesis. Though questions concerning community assembly have often been spatially framed, our model shows that the span of the time frame can also affect, or even reverse, inferences about assembly processes. Our model also implies that a shift in the frame of reference from species to individuals brings a new perspective to community assembly.

Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values.

We tested this prediction for two threatened species of Procellariiformes sharing similar life history traits: the European Storm Petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) and the Balearic Shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus). Within each species, we compared adult Survival, proportion of transients (breeders that do not settle), and average productivity at two neighboring colonies. Physical and environmental features (e.g., food availability) of the breeding sites were similar. However, while Balearic Shearwater colonies were free of predators, aerial predators occurred especially in one colony of the European Storm Petrel. Despite this difference, we found similar results for the two species. A high proportion of transient birds was detected in only one colony of each species, ranging between 0.00-0.38 and 0.10-0.63 for the petrels and shearwaters, respectively. This seems to be all emergent feature of spatially structured populations of seabirds, unrelated to colony size or predator pressure, that can have important demographic consequences for local population dynamics and their synchrony. Local survival of resident birds was different Lit each colony, an unexpected result, especially for predator-free colonies of Balearic Shearwater. Productivity varied between the two colonies of European Storm Petrels, but not between the two colonies of Balearic Shearwaters. We demonstrated that within each species, several demographic parameters were colony specific and Sufficiently different to generate short-term asynchronous dynamics. Our findings Suggest that, in spatially structured populations, local factors, such as predation or small-scale habitat features, or population factors, such as individual quality or age structure, can generate unexpected asynchrony between neighboring populations.",10.1890/06-0326.1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Here I show that, for a given body mass; six species of Cancer crabs (Cancer antennarius, Cancer branneri, Cancer gracilis, Cancer magister, Cancer oregonensis and Cancer productus) were able to exert mean maximum biting forces greater than the forces exerted in any other activity by most other animals. These strong biting forces were in part a result of the high stresses (740-1350kNm(-2)) generated by the claw closer muscle. Furthermore, the maximum muscle stress increased with increasing mean resting sarcomere length (10-18 mu m) for the closer muscle of the claws of these six Cancer species. A more extensive analysis incorporating published data on muscle stresses in other animal groups revealed that stress scales isometrically with the resting sarcomere length among species, as predicted by the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. Therefore, muscle or filament traits other than a very long mean sarcomere length need not be invoked in explaining the high stresses generated by crustacean claws.",10.1098/rspb.2000.1167,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Estimation of limits to stocking density, based on ecosystem productivity and energetic requirements of stocked species, can be used to gauge the appropriate magnitude of release densities, minimizing waste of resources, and the possibility for adverse stocking effects. A generalized mass-balance model (generalized predatory impact model) for stocking density estimation has been developed. The approach is based around the principles of ECOPATH and accounts for dynamic estimation of stocking-related ecosystem relationships at fine temporal (days) and spatial scales. The main parameter inputs include probability distributions for key biological and life-history traits of stocked species and estimates of primary productivity for the target ecosystem. The energetic requirements of stocked fish are evaluated in terms of growth and mortality as well as ontogenetic transitions in diet, habitat use, morphology, and migration. The theoretical carrying capacity for a stocked species within a given arena is assessed from primary productivity, levels of predation by stocked fish on different trophic groups, and a specified level of acceptable trophic impact. A Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainty is used to provide a probability distribution of stocking densities for a given trophic impact. The model is applied for stocking juveniles of snook (Centropomus undecimalis) in Sarasota, FL, USA, and mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) in Georges River, NSW, Australia. The model is useful for estimating an appropriate stocking density when planning pilot-scale fish releases. Such releases should be carefully monitored to validate model assumptions and determine density-dependent and other environmental effects.",10.1080/10641262.2013.796815,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The emission of isoprene gas - a trait shared by one-third of tree species - is known to protect leaf biochemistry under climatic stress. Here, we test the hypothesis that isoprene emission shapes tree species compositions in tropical forests by enhancing the tolerance of emitting trees to heat and drought. Using forest inventory data, we estimated the proportional abundance of isoprene-emitting trees (pIE) at 103 lowland tropical sites. We also quantified the temporal composition shifts in three tropical forests - two natural and one artificial - subjected to either anomalous warming or drought. Across the landscape, pIE increased with site mean annual temperature, but decreased with dry season length. Through time, pIE strongly increased under high temperatures, and moderately increased following drought. Our analysis shows that isoprene emission is a key plant trait determining species responses to climate. For species adapted to seasonal dry periods, isoprene emission may tradeoff with alternative strategies, such as leaf deciduousness. Community selection for isoprene-emitting species is a potential mechanism for enhanced forest resilience to climatic change.",10.1111/nph.15304,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Rainforest,1,0,1,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,trait = isoprene gas emission (Y/N),

In this study, we used in-stream aquatic insects as surrogates to measure the aquatic health of urban streams in the Douala township. We compared these assessments with samples collected from a suburb stream. Aquatic insects were sampled monthly over a 13-month period in ten urban sites and two forest sites. Measurements of the environmental variables were done simultaneously. Results revealed that urban streams are highly polluted and ecologically impaired. The classification of samples by the self-organized mapping analysis permitted to clearly separate urban and non-urban aquatic insect assemblages. Higher total taxa richness, higher values of diversity indices, and higher Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) scores were recorded in forest sites. Inversely, in urban streams, very low taxa richness was observed, with the proliferation of dipterans, and the absence of EPT taxa. The EPT, coleoptera, and hemiptera taxa, the functional feeding groups of shredders and predators, and the insect taxa relying on gills and plastron for breathing were good predictors of anthropogenic pollution.

This extension is already known to have modified the estuary current and sediment dynamics, as well as reducing biomass of the suprabenthos assemblage, for the whole downstream part of the system. However, studies on other biotic communities were largely inconclusive, and an ecosystem-wide analysis was still lacking. Here, we performed a before/after study of ecosystem dynamics of the different habitats of the Seine estuary, using a Linear Inverse Modelling technique (LIM-MCMC) to estimate all flows occurring in the food web. Ecological Network Analysis indices were calculated, summarising ecosystem functioning traits and giving indications about the habitat health status. Results showed that the southern flank (FS, Fosse Sud) exhibits all characteristics to be considered as the least stressed habitat of the estuary: system activity and functional specialisation of flows were stable between periods, ecosystem recycling processes and detrital dynamics were also stable; an increase in trophic specialisation (decrease in system omnivory) was the only change confirming a general ecological succession. The northern flank (FN, Fosse Nord), where the actual terminal was built, showed a food web with increased importance of lower trophic levels (increased detritivory and carbon recycling), increased stability and flow efficiency, but possibly regressed to a previous step in ecological succession. In the central navigation channel (CH), patterns of network indices were overall inconclusive and the general image is one of a constantly shifting food web, a condition possibly caused by the year-round dredging activities. The functioning of the Seine estuary especially of FN and FS - seems to have been modified by the combination of harbour construction and the related mitigation measures. Network indices partially captured this combination of changes and, although not fully operational yet, they are promising tools to comply with the European Union mandate of defining ecosystem health status.

"Teder, T; Vellau, H; Tammaru, T",2014,Age and size at maturity: A quantitative review of diet-induced reaction norms in insects,EVOLUTION,"Optimality models predict that diet-induced bivariate reaction norms for age and size at maturity can have diverse shapes, with the slope varying from negative to positive. To evaluate these predictions, we perform a quantitative review of relevant data, using a literature-derived database of body sizes and development times for over 200 insect species. We show that bivariate reaction norms with a negative slope prevail in nearly all taxonomic and ecological categories of insects as well as in some other ectotherm taxa with comparable life histories (arachnids and amphibians). In insects, positive slopes are largely limited to species, which feed on discrete resource items, parasitoids in particular. By contrast, with virtually no meaningful exceptions, herbivorous and predatory insects display reaction norms with a negative slope. This is consistent with the idea that predictable resource depletion, a scenario selecting for positively sloped reaction norms, is not frequent for these insects. Another source of such selection-a positive correlation between resource levels and juvenile mortality rates-should similarly be rare among insects. Positive slopes can also be predicted by models which integrate life-history evolution and population dynamics. As bottom-up regulation is not common in most insect groups, such models may not be most appropriate for insects.",10.1111/evo.12518,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = diet, age, size at maturity",

A number of correlation-based methods, such as the community weighted trait means method (CWM), the fourth-corner correlation method and the multivariate method RLQ, have been proposed to estimate such trait-environment associations. In these methods, valid statistical testing proceeds by performing two separate resampling tests, one site-based and the other species-based and by assessing significance by the largest of the two p-values (the p(max) test). Recently, regression-based methods using generalized linear models (GLM) have been proposed as a promising alternative with statistical inference via site-based resampling. We investigated the performance of this new approach along with approaches that mimicked the pmax test using GLM instead of fourth-corner. By simulation using models with additional random variation in the species response to the environment, the site-based resampling tests using GLM are shown to have severely inflated type I error, of up to 90%, when the nominal level is set as 5%. In addition, predictive modelling of such data using site-based cross-validation very often identified trait-environment interactions that had no predictive value. The problem that we identify is not an ""omitted variable bias"" problem as it occurs even when the additional random variation is independent of the observed trait and environment data. Instead, it is a problem of ignoring a random effect. In the same simulations, the GLM-based p(max) test controlled the type I error in all models proposed so far in this context, but still gave slightly inflated error in more complex models that included both missing (but important) traits and missing (but important) environmental variables. For screening the importance of single trait-environment combinations, the fourth-corner test is shown to give almost the same results as the GLM-based tests in far less computing time.",10.7717/peerj.2885,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"ter Braak, CJF",2017,Fourth-corner correlation is a score test statistic in a log-linear trait-environment model that is useful in permutation testing,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,"Ecologists wish to understand the role of traits of species in determining where each species occurs in the environment. For this, they wish to detect associations between species traits and environmental variables from three data tables, species count data from sites with associated environmental data and species trait data from data bases. These three tables leave a missing part, the fourth-corner. The fourth-corner correlations between quantitative traits and environmental variables, heuristically proposed 20 years ago, fill this corner. Generalized linear (mixed) models have been proposed more recently as a model-based alternative. This paper shows that the squared fourth-corner correlation times the total count is precisely the score test statistic for testing the linear-by-linear interaction in a Poisson log-linear model that also contains species and sites as main effects. For multiple traits and environmental variables, the score test statistic is proportional to the total inertia of a doubly constrained correspondence analysis. When the count data are over-dispersed compared to the Poisson or when there are other deviations from the model such as unobserved traits or environmental variables that interact with the observed ones, the score test statistic does not have the usual chi-square distribution. For these types of deviations, row- and column-based permutation methods (and their sequential combination) are proposed to control the type I error without undue loss of power (unless no deviation is present), as illustrated in a small simulation study. The issues for valid statistical testing are illustrated using the well-known Dutch Dune Meadow data set.",10.1007/s10651-017-0368-0,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"ter Braak, CJF; Peres-Neto, PR; Dray, S",2018,Simple parametric tests for trait-environment association,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Question The CWM approach is an easy way of analysing trait-environment association by regressing (or correlating) the mean trait per plot against an environmental variable and assessing the statistical significance of the slope or the associated correlation coefficient. However, the CWM approach does not yield valid tests, as random traits (or random indicator values) are far too often judged significantly related to the environmental variable, even when the trait and environmental variable are extrinsic to (not derived from) the community data. Existing solutions are the ZS-modified test (Zeleny & Schaffers,) and the max (or sequential) test based on the fourth-corner correlation. Both tests are based on permutations which become cumbersome when many tests need to be carried out and many permutations are required, as in methods that correct for multiple testing. The main goal of this study was to compare these existing permutation-based solutions and to develop a quick and easy parametric test that can replace them. MethodsResultsThis study decomposes the fourth-corner correlation in two ways, which suggests a simple parametric approach consisting of assessing the significances of two linear regressions, one plot-level test as in the CWM approach and one species-level test, the reverse of the CWM approach, that regresses the environmental mean per species (i.e. the species niche centroid) on to the trait. The tests are combined by taking the maximum p-value. The type I error rates and power of this parametric max test are examined by simulation of one- and two-dimensional Gaussian models and log-linear models. The ZS-modified test and the fourth-corner max test are conservative in different scenarios, the ZS-modified test being even more conservative than the fourth-corner. The new parametric max test is shown to control the type I error and has equal or even higher power than permutation tests based on the fourth-corner, the ZS-modified test and variants thereof. A weighted version of the new test showed inflated type I error. ConclusionThe combination of two simple regressions is a good alternative to the fourth-corner and the ZS-modified test.

The majority of spring and summer events have advanced, and more rapidly than previously documented. Such consistency is indicative of shared large scale drivers. Furthermore, average rates of change have accelerated in a way that is consistent with observed warming trends. Less coherent patterns in some groups of organisms point to the agency of more local scale processes and multiple drivers. For the first time we show a broad scale signal of differential phenological change among trophic levels; across environments advances in timing were slowest for secondary consumers, thus heightening the potential risk of temporal mismatch in key trophic interactions.

Four morphological characters were registered as semi-quantitative traits to assess variation between populations. Data were obtained from 325 adults originating from 14 locations. A statistical approach was performed in conjunction with observations of ecological traits and a survey of genetic relationships assessed by mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b analysis. The results indicate character displacement in Chrysoperla affinis when living in sympatry with Chrysoperla carnea. The morphological traits of Ch. affinis sympatric with Ch. carnea differ from those of allopatric Ch. affinis, although the genetic distance between those strains was weak. This was associated with a large difference in microhabitats and premating behaviour. Variation in courtship songs manifests a process of speciation within related populations. Thus, that ecological switching can also promote character displacement is supported. This suggests that character displacement acts through phenotypic variability and mediates negative interactions among species. These findings suggest that the highest rate of speciation occurs in groups of species in which competition is the strongest.

We test whether four commonly used plant functional groups represent variation in six ecologically important plant traits. Location Tundra biome. Time period Data collected between 1964 and 2016. Major taxa studied 295 tundra vascular plant species. Methods We compiled a database of six plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen, seed mass) for tundra species. We examined the variation in species-level trait expression explained by four traditional functional groups (evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, graminoids, forbs), and whether variation explained was dependent upon the traits included in analysis. We further compared the explanatory power and species composition of functional groups to alternative classifications generated using post hoc clustering of species-level traits. Results Traditional functional groups explained significant differences in trait expression, particularly amongst traits associated with resource economics, which were consistent across sites and at the biome scale. However, functional groups explained 19% of overall trait variation and poorly represented differences in traits associated with plant size. Post hoc classification of species did not correspond well with traditional functional groups, and explained twice as much variation in species-level trait expression. Main conclusions Traditional functional groups only coarsely represent variation in well-measured traits within tundra plant communities, and better explain resource economic traits than size-related traits.

Here, we test the theory of limiting similarity in a roadside plant community that has been monitored for almost 50 years. We measure differences between observed trait distributions ('functional diversity, FD') and those expected on the basis of three different null models, several trait combinations and four different methods of measuring FD. 3. The general pattern was of lower observed than expected FD, or no difference between observed and expected FD, independent of FD measure and trait set. Some rare species had 'unusual' traits; thus if the null model assumed all species had equal chance of occurring, observed FD was generally lower than expected by chance, but if the null model assumed the probability of occurrence of rare species was proportional to the observed frequency of occurrence or excluded rare species, observed FD was not significantly different from expected. 4. Synthesis. The results do not support the idea that niche differences are central to the assembly of this plant community.

We used macroinvertebrate community data from 10 streams that varied independently in local ecological conditions and spatial proximity. Neutral theory predicts that similarity in communities will be negatively associated with distance between sites, while niche theory suggests that community similarity will be positively associated with similarity in local ecological conditions. Similarity in total invertebrate, grazer and predator assemblages showed negative relationships with distance and, for grazers and predators, positive relationships with local ecological conditions. However, the best model predicting community similarity in all three cases included aspects of both local ecological conditions and distance between sites. When assemblages were analysed according to dispersal ability, high-dispersal species were shown to be freely accessing all sites and community similarity was not well predicted by either local ecology or spatial separation. Assemblages of species with low and moderate dispersal ability were best predicted by combined models, including distance between sites and local ecological factors. The results suggest that the perceived dichotomy between neutral and local environmental processes in determining local patterns of diversity may not be useful.

Food webs are a powerful whole-system way to represent the patterns of biodiversity and energy flow in a readily quantifiable framework amenable to comparative analyses. Integrated theory and data on complex trophic interactions provide useful and novel ways to study ecosystem structure, dynamics, function and stability. 2. Freshwater ecology has contributed considerably to the advancement of food-web ecology. This has occurred through early application of methodological advances such as stable isotope analysis and description of some of the most detailed food webs, including Little Rock Lake and the Broadstone Stream food webs. 3. Freshwater food webs are often highly resolved, although the inclusion of components such as bacteria continues to be challenging. Characteristics of stream food webs appear to include high rates of omnivory and a strong role for body size as a structuring influence. 4. While freshwater ecology has often included landscape factors, food webs from freshwaters have most often been collected at small spatial scales. There is a need to take a landscape approach to the study of food-web dynamics in freshwater ecosystems. 5. Studies of food webs that take an experimental approach or utilise natural gradients remain rare but will be vital to untangling causative relationships between changing environmental conditions and food-web structure and dynamics. 6. Emerging directions in freshwater food-web research involve integrating individual-level variation and information on traits into food-web studies. This is allowing a growing understanding of the ways in which food webs can be used to integrate community, evolutionary and population processes into studies of biodiversity. 7. A Virtual Issue of Freshwater Biology entitled Advances in food-web research: a compendium of Freshwater Biology papers brings together papers included in this review that have been published in the journal since 1985.

Nest defence is a complex trait that might consistently differ among individuals (personality), while simultaneously vary within individuals (plasticity) according to the reproductive value of the offspring. Both complementary aspects of individual variation can influence fitness, but the causality of links with reproductive success remains poorly understood. We repeatedly tested free-living female great tits (Parus major) for nest defence (hissing) behaviour across the nesting cycle, by presenting them with a model predator. Hissing behaviour was highly repeatable but, despite population-level plasticity, we found no support for individual differences in plasticity. Path analysis revealed that repeatable differences in hissing behaviour had no direct effect on nest success or fledgling number. However, our best supported path-model showed that more fiercely hissing females laid smaller clutches, with clutch size in turn positively influencing fledgling number, suggesting that females are most likely facing a trade-off between investment in nest defence and reproduction. Strong stabilizing selection for optimal plasticity, in combination with life-history trade-offs, might explain the high repeatability of nest defence and its link with reproductive success.",10.1098/rsos.182180,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Current knowledge of primary succession is mainly from studies of vegetation dynamics, whereas information about belowground microbes remains unclear. Here, we combined shifts in community assembly processes with microbial primary succession to better understand mechanisms governing the stochastic/deterministic balance. We investigated fungal succession and community assembly via high-throughput sequencing along a well-established glacier forefront chronosequence that spans 2-188 years of deglaciation. Shannon diversity and evenness peaked at a distance of 370m and declined afterwards. The response of fungal diversity to distance varied in different phyla. Basidiomycota Shannon diversity significantly decreased with distance, while the pattern of Rozellomycota Shannon diversity was unimodal. Abundance of most frequencies OTU2 (Cryptococcus terricola) increased with successional distance, whereas that of OTU65 (Tolypocladium tundrense) decreased. Based on null deviation analyses, composition of the fungal community was initially governed by deterministic processes strongly but later less deterministic processes. Our results revealed that distance, altitude, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and NH4+-N significantly correlated with fungal community composition along the chronosequence. These results suggest that the drivers of fungal community are dynamics in a glacier chronosequence, that may relate to fungal ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem. The information will provide understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of microbial community assembly during ecosystem succession under different scales and scenario.",10.3389/fmicb.2017.01028,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

B.; Bendix, J.; Brandl, R.; Farwig, N.",2017,Ants as indicators of environmental change and ecosystem processes.,Ecological Indicators,"Environmental stressors and changes in land use have led to rapid and dramatic species losses. As such, we need effective monitoring programs that alert us not only to biodiversity losses, but also to functional changes in species assemblages and associated ecosystem processes. Ants are important components of terrestrial food webs and a key group in food web interactions and numerous ecosystem processes. Their sensitive and rapid response to environmental changes suggests that they are a suitable indicator group for the monitoring of abiotic, biotic, and functional changes. We tested the suitability of the incidence (i.e. the sum of all species occurrences at 30 baits), species richness, and functional richness of ants as indicators of ecological responses to environmental change, forest degradation, and of the ecosystem process predation on herbivorous arthropods. We sampled data along an elevational gradient (1000-3000 m a.s.l.) and across seasons (wetter and drier period) in a montane rainforest in southern Ecuador. The incidence of ants declined with increasing elevation but did not change with forest degradation. Ant incidence was higher during the drier season. Species richness was highly correlated with incidence and showed comparable results. Functional richness also declined with increasing elevation and did not change with forest degradation. However, a null-model comparison revealed that the functional richness pattern did not differ from a pattern expected for ant assemblages with randomly distributed sets of traits across species. Predation on artificial caterpillars decreased along the elevational gradient; the pattern was not driven by elevation itself, but by ant incidence (or interchangeable by ant richness), which positively affected predation. In spite of lower ant incidence (or ant richness), predation was higher during the wetter season and did not change with forest degradation and ant functional richness. We used path analysis to disentangle the causal relationships of the environmental factors temperature (with elevation as a proxy), season, and habitat degradation with the incidence and functional richness of ants, and their consequences for predation. Our results would suggest that the forecasted global warming might support more active and species-rich ant assemblages, which in turn would mediate increased predation on herbivorous arthropods. However, this prediction should be made with reservation, as it assumes that the dispersal of ants keeps pace with the climatic changes as well as a one-dimensional relationship between ants and predation within a food-web that comprises species interactions of much higher complexity. Our results also suggested that degraded forests in our study area might provide suitable habitat for epigaeic, ground-dwelling ant assemblages that do not differ in incidence, species richness, functional richness, composition, or predation on arthropods from assemblages of primary forests. Most importantly, our results suggest that the occurrence and activity of ants are important drivers of ecosystem processes and that changes in the incidence and richness of ants can be used as effective indicators of responses to temperature changes and of predation within mega-diverse forest ecosystems.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.01.029,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Insects,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = weber's length, head length, mandible length, length of hind femur",

For example, body size affects the fitness of individuals in various ways. Yet especially for ectotherms, the applicability of general rules of interspecific clines of body size and even more so of other morphological traits is still under debate. Here we tested relationships between elevation (as a proxy for temperature) and productivity with four ecologically relevant morphological traits of orthopteran assemblages that are related to fecundity (body size), dispersal (wing length), jumping ability (hind femur length), and predator detection (eye size). We measured traits of 160 orthopteran species that were sampled along an extensive environmental gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), spanning elevations from 790 to 4,410 m above sea level (a.s.l.) with different levels of plant productivity. For traits other than body size, we calculated the residuals from a regression on body length to estimate the variation of traits irrespective of body size. Bayesian analyses revealed that mean body size of assemblages, as well as the means of relative wing length, hind femur length, and eye size, decreased with increasing elevation. Body size and relative eye size also decreased with increasing productivity. Both phylogenetic relationships, as well as species-specific adaptations, contributed to these patterns. Our results suggest that orthopteran assemblages had higher fecundity and better dispersal and escape abilities, as well as better predator detection at higher temperatures (low elevations) than at low temperatures (high elevations). Large body sizes might be advantageous in habitats with low productivity because of a reduced risk of starvation. Likewise, large eye size might be advantageous because of the ability to detect predators in habitats with low vegetation cover, where hiding possibilities are scarce. Our study highlights that changes in temperature and productivity not only lead to interspecific changes in body size but are also related to independent changes of other morphological traits that influence the ecological fit of organisms in their environment.",10.1002/ecy.2436,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Insects,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body length, pronotum length, pronotum width, wing length, length of the femur of front, middle, hind legs, length of tibia in hind leg, eye diameter, interoccular distance",

We use the California sea otter population as a case study to validate the use of archival time-depth data to detect and measure differences in foraging behaviour and diet. We collected observational foraging data from radio-tagged sea otters that had been equipped with Mk9 time depth recorders (TDRs, Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA). After recapturing the study animals and retrieving the TDRs it was possible to compare the two data types, by matching individual dives from the TDR record with observational data and thus examining behavioural correlates of capture success and prey species. Individuals varied with respect to prey selection, aggregating into one of three distinct dietary specializations. A number of TDR-derived parameters, particularly dive depth and post-dive surface interval, differed predictably between specialist types. A combination of six dive parameters was particularly useful for discriminating between specialist types, and when incorporated into a multivariate cluster analysis, these six parameters resulted in classification of 13 adult female sea otters into three clusters that corresponded almost perfectly to the diet-based classification (1 out of 13 animals was misclassified). Thus based solely on quantifiable traits of time-depth data that have been collected over an appropriate period (in this case 1 year per animal), it was possible to assign female sea otters to diet type with > 90% accuracy. TDR data can thus be used as a toot to measure the degree of individual specialization in sea otter populations, a conclusion that will likely apply to other diving marine vertebrates as well. Our ultimate goals must be both to understand the causes of individual specialization, and to incorporate such variation into models of population- and community-level food web dynamics.

This paper focuses on the latter strategy. Most of those predatory mite species are generalist predators; they are naturally present in agro-ecosystems both on crops and adjacent natural vegetation. Because of such characteristics, their occurrence is usually associated with the use of fewer pesticides, providing relief to ecosystem services. As a first baseline for managing their occurrence in agro-ecosystems, a review of the present knowledge of plants and predatory mite interactions and predator dispersal ability is proposed. In addition, based on the author's own occurrence database, the study aims at analyzing (i) plant traits and the potential co-evolutionary relationships between plants and predatory mite species and (ii) how this can be used to forecast favorable plants to key predatory mites. For this, some examples were taken, i.e., vine and citrus crops, and three species, Kampimodromus aberrans, Euseius stipulates, and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri. The main conclusion is that the occurrence database can help in determining the probability of finding predatory mite species on crops and non-crop plants. However, because some elements are lacking, especially predatory mite density, plant traits and the true overall distribution, it is currently, difficult to associate plant traits and plant phylogeny to Phytoseiidae diversity. Additional meta-analyses in collaboration with plant specialists would be required. Finally, the paper presents some examples of agroecosystem management at different scales (intercropping, agroforestry, borders management, landscape).",10.3389/fevo.2018.00192,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Toekoelyi, Jacint; Schmidt, Julia; Barta, Zoltan",2014,Climate and mammalian life histories,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,"Mammals display considerable geographical variation in life history traits. To understand how climatic factors might influence this variation, we analysed the relationship between life history traits - adult body size, litter size, number of litters per year, gestation length, neonate body mass, weaning age and age at sexual maturity - and several environmental variables quantifying the seasonality and predictability of temperature and precipitation across the distribution range of five terrestrial mammal groups. Environmental factors correlated strongly with each other; therefore, we used principal components analysis to obtain orthogonal climatic predictors that could be used in multivariate models. We found that in bats, primates and even-toed ungulates adult body size tends to be larger in species inhabiting cold, dry, seasonal environments, whereas in carnivores and rodents a smaller body size is characteristic of warm, dry environments, suggesting that low food availability might limit adult size. Species inhabiting cold, dry, seasonal habitats have fewer, larger litters and shorter gestation periods; however, annual fecundity in these species is not higher, implying that the large litter size of mammals living at high latitudes is probably a consequence of time constraints imposed by strong seasonality. On the other hand, the number of litters per year and annual fecundity were greater in species inhabiting environments with higher seasonality in precipitation. Lastly, we found little evidence for specific effects of environmental variability. Our results highlight the complex effects of environmental factors in the evolution of life history traits in mammals.

Classical competition theory states that they will be less similar than expected by chance, whilst the environmental structuring hypothesis stales tl-lat they will be more similar. We investigated these predictions by applying phylogenetic methods of analysis (PICs) to a grassland community examining species on the basis of their traits. At the scale of investigation most useful in making predictions about the presence and abundance of species (the community level), the species forming the community were more similar than would be expected by chance. The use of PICs resulted in a more sensitive test than if phylogeny had been ignored, allowing the detection of effects that would otherwise have been overlooked or underestimated. Selected traits from the PICs analysis were used to develop a predictive model of community membership using discriminant analysis.

"Tofts, R; Silvertown, J",2002,Community assembly from the local species pool: an experimental study using congeneric species pairs,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"1 Vegetation-environment relationships are well understood at the geographical scale, but it is still not clear what role chance and historical contigency play in the assembly of communities from the local species pool. We addressed this question experimentally by comparing the performance of congeneric species introduced into a grassland community. 2 We used the National Vegetation Classification and distribution maps to define the local pool of grassland species suited to our experimental site. From this we selected five pairs of congeneric species. One member of each pair was native to the experimental site ('present' species) and one member was represented in the local species pool but absent from the community ('absent' species). 3 If community assembly processes are deterministic, then absent species should underperform present congeners. Any other result would imply that chance, dispersal limitation or historical contingency plays a role in community assembly. Our experimental arrangement allowed us to assess the consistency of comparisons across different grazing treatment combinations. 4 Two field experiments were undertaken. The first investigated the effects of dispersal limitation by introducing seed of congeners and monitoring performance. The second investigated the survival of congeners introduced as small plants at the early stages of growth in 'plugs'. A laboratory germination test and a combined analysis of both field experiments were also undertaken. 5 Some species showed markedly different responses from their congeners in the two field experiments. Overall, the present species did not consistently perform better than their absent congeners. This indicates that the study community bears the strong imprint of dispersal limitation or other historical factors, a finding consistent with results previously obtained for the same community using a trait-based model. 6 We conclude that the accuracy of predictions about community composition will be limited by the success with which factors such as propagule dispersal and differential effects of seed predation and herbivory can be modelled.

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the patterns of spatial overlap and coexistence in an assemblage of polychaetes associated with mussel beds in a rocky intertidal habitat on the Pacific coast of Peru. Mussel beds are made up of two zones in the intertidal: the lower, more extensive zone formed by Semimytillus algosus and the upper zone formed by Perumytilus purpuratus, Null models were employed to assess the magnitude of spatial overlap between pairs of taxa encompassing a total of seven taxonomic groups. Two taxa belonging to the same functional group tended to be spatially segregated in the Semimytilus bed: Pseudonereis vs. Halosydna (large free-ranging predators) and Scoloplos vs. Mediomastus (deposit feeders), with further segregating tendencies between Pseudonereis and Mediomastus, and between Halosydna and Scoloplos. Small-sized, free-ranging 'Typosyllis' and the bottom-dwelling scavenging predator Lumbrineris were also spatially associated. Thus, this polychaete assemblage appears to be loosely organised around groupings of taxa which are somewhat different in ecological traits and form mosaic patterns of distribution with reduced overlap within the Semimytilus bed. These relationships were weak to non-existent in the upper, drier Perumytilus habitat where polychaete density was low.",10.1046/j.1439-0485.2000.00732.x,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Marine,Other,Intertidal,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = ecomorpho groups,

We review our ecological understanding of wildlife infectious diseases from the individual host to the ecosystem scale, highlighting where conceptual thinking lacks verification, discussing difficulties and challenges, and offering potential future research directions. 2. New molecular approaches hold potential to increase our understanding of parasite interactions within hosts. Also, advances in our knowledge of immune systems makes immunological parameters viable measures of parasite exposure, and useful tools for improving our understanding of causal mechanisms. 3. Studies of transmission dynamics have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in host behaviour and physiology, and of contact processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. An important future challenge is to determine the key transmission mechanisms maintaining the persistence of different types of diseases in the wild. 4. Regulation of host populations is too complex to consider parasite effects in isolation from other factors. One solution is to seek a unified understanding of the conditions under which (and the ecological rules determining when) population scale impacts of parasites can occur. 5. Good evidence now shows that both direct effects of parasites, and trait mediated indirect effects, frequently mediate the success of invasive species and their impacts on recipient communities. A wider exploration of these effects is now needed. 6. At the ecosystem scale, research is needed to characterize the circumstances and conditions under which both fluxes in parasite biomass, and trait mediated effects, are significant in ecosystem processes, and to demonstrate that parasites do indeed increase 'ecosystem health'. 7. There is a general need for more empirical testing of predictions and subsequent development of theory in the classic research cycle. Experimental field studies, meta-analyses, the collection and analysis of long-term data sets, and data constrained modelling, will all be key to advancing our understanding. 8.

They present a sea-land environmental gradient and different vegetation types are found in a very short space: embryo, mobile and fixed dunes. The aims were to study changes in taxonomic diversity and species richness along the ecological gradient and if they were followed by changes in functional or phylogenetic diversity. This study took place along a 750 km coastal stretch, belonging to four biogeographic sectors, in the southwest of France and northwest of Spain. Twelve locations were selected, where coastal dune habitats were explored. In each location and for each vegetation type four 10 x 10 m plots were sampled. In each plot abundances of vascular plants were recorded. Taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity at the alpha level were measured. NMDS analysis, PERMANOVA and linear mixed effects models were used to explore differences between biogeographic sectors and habitats for species composition and each derived taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic index. We found different species composition in each vegetation type: in embryo dunes it was constant along biogeographic sectors, while it changed in mobile and fixed dunes. Taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity indices did not show changes at biogeographic sector level despite the species difference in mobile and fixed dunes. An increase in taxonomic diversity from embryo to fixed dunes was also found, followed by an increase in functional divergence. Phylogenetic diversity decreased from embryo to fixed dunes. Therefore, in habitats more exposed to sea, wind and waves, as embryo dunes, environmental filtering selects some traits of non-related species. On more sheltered habitats such as fixed dunes, biotic interactions like competitive exclusion leads to a divergence in functionality.

(ii) In the functional diversity of regenerative and vegetative traits we expected different temporal patterns. We confirmed the first hypothesis, as in the first few years most traits displayed high fluctuations with no clear patterns.

Several studies have investigated how social status or behavioural and physiological traits promote leadership and followership in various species, but the potential role of ecological factors in modulating social cohesion of foraging groups has received less attention. We used social network analysis to investigate how a temporary shortage of food affects within-group following behaviour in house sparrow, Passer domesticus, flocks and which individual characteristics influence birds' positions in the following networks. To test this, we observed nine captive house sparrow flocks, composed of 12 individuals each, in three consecutive sessions, in which the food availability was altered. We found that food reduction did not modify the following network structure and that individuals had consistent positions within the flocks, as males and adults were followed more often than females and juveniles, respectively. However, short-term food reduction affected individuals' following behaviour according to their age: adults increased their following rates during food scarcity, whereas the opposite trend was found in juveniles. This pattern also remained after the re-establishment of initial conditions, suggesting that ecological changes can also induce individual-level lasting effects. Our study provides empirical evidence that food reduction does not affect the global social structure of house sparrow flocks but nevertheless individuals respond differently to ecological changes according to their age.

In Europe, general evolutionary scenarios have been defined from genetic evidence. Recently, these scenarios have been challenged with genetic as well as fossil data. The origins of the modern distributions of most temperate plant and animal species could predate the Last Glacial Maximum. The glacial survival of such populations may have occurred in either southern (Mediterranean regions) and/or northern (Carpathians) refugia. Here, a phylogeographic analysis of a widespread European small mammal (Microtus arvalis) is conducted with a multidisciplinary approach. Genetic, fossil and ecological traits are used to assess the evolutionary history of this vole. Regardless of whether the European distribution of the five previously identified evolutionary lineages is corroborated, this combined analysis brings to light several colonization processes of M. arvalis. The species' dispersal was relatively gradual with glacial survival in small favourable habitats in Western Europe (from Germany to Spain) while in the rest of Europe, because of periglacial conditions, dispersal was less regular with bottleneck events followed by postglacial expansions. Our study demonstrates that the evolutionary history of European temperate small mammals is indeed much more complex than previously suggested. Species can experience heterogeneous evolutionary histories over their geographic range. Multidisciplinary approaches should therefore be preferentially chosen in prospective studies, the better to understand the impact of climatic change on past and present biodiversity.",10.1371/journal.pone.0003532,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Townhill, B. L.; Pinnegar, J. K.; Righton, D. A.; Metcalfe, J. D.",2017,"Fisheries, low oxygen and climate change: how much do we really know?",JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,"As a result of long-term climate change, regions of the ocean with low oxygen concentrations are predicted to occur more frequently and persist for longer periods of time in the future. When low levels of oxygen are present, this places additional pressure on marine organisms to meet their metabolic requirements, with implications for growth, feeding and reproduction. Extensive research has been carried out on the effects of acute hypoxia, but far less on long-term chronic effects of low oxygen zones, especially with regard to commercially important fishes and shellfishes. To provide further understanding on how commercial species could be affected, the results of relevant experiments must support population and ecosystem models. This is not easy because individual effects are wide-ranging; for example, studies to date have shown that low oxygen zones can affect predator-prey relationships as some species are able to tolerate low oxygen more than others. Some fishes may move away from areas until oxygen levels return to acceptable levels, while others take advantage of a reduced start response in prey fishes and remain in the area to feed. Sessile or less mobile species such as shellfishes are unable to move out of depleted oxygen zones. Some species can tolerate low oxygen levels for only short periods of time, while others are able to acclimatize. To advance the knowledge-base further, a number of promising technological and modelling-based developments and the role of physiological data within these, are proposed. These include advances in remote telemetry (tagging) and sensor technologies, trait-based analyses to provide insight into how whole assemblages might respond in the future, research into long-term adaptability of species, population and ecosystem modelling techniques and quantification of economic effects. In addition, more detailed oxygen monitoring and projections are required to better understand the likely temporal and local-scale changes in oxygen.

In this study of thirty-five benthic insect taxa at fifty-four tributary sites of the Taieri River on the South Island of New Zealand, we chose as the temporal axis the intensity/frequency of disturbance, defined in terms of bed movement during high discharge events. As the spatial axis, we postulated that three features would provide refugia and therefore ameliorate disturbance-percentage of the bed with low shear stress, percentage of the bed made up of large substratum particles and availability of interstitial space in the bed-from which we derived a combined multivariate refugium axis.3. More disturbed communities contained a significantly higher percentage of individuals possessing the following traits: small size, high adult mobility, habitat generalist (each predicted to confer resilience in response to disturbance), clinger, streamlined/flattened and with two or more life stages outside the stream (each predicted to confer resistance in the face of disturbance). When analyses were performed on the percentage of taxa having particular traits, the predicted positive relationships with average bed movement were found for high adult mobility and habitat generalist traits.4. The percentage of variance in trait scores explained by intensity of disturbance was generally higher in sites with less refugia available and lower in sites further from the headwaters. The percentage of variance explained was higher in sites recently subject to a major high discharge disturbance, suggesting that disturbances tend to strengthen the pattern of preponderance of resilience/resistance traits.5. We mapped insect taxa onto the two-dimensional templet, following Grime et al.'s triangular terrestrial plant classification. The full variety of resistance and resilience traits were represented in insect species throughout the templet, but taxa associated with more disturbed conditions generally displayed a larger number of resilience and resistance traits, combined, than taxa associated with more stable stream beds.",10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00166.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Insects,River,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = small size, high adult mobility, habitat generalist (each predicted to confer resilience in response to disturbance), clinger, streamlined/flattened and with two or more life stages outside the stream",

We quantified 7 measures of disturbance, 3 dealing with the pattern of disturbance of the stream bed (assessed using painted tracer particles), 3 dealing with aspects of discharge variation and 1 being a subjective composite measure of stream channel stability (Pfankuch's index). Hypotheses relating to invertebrate taxon richness (maximal at intermediate levels of disturbance) and the representation of particular insect species traits (assemblages in more disturbed sites contain higher percentages of individuals possessing high adult mobility and streamlined-flattened larval morphology) were both supported when disturbance was measured in terms of bed movement but generally not when measured in terms of discharge variation. When disturbance was estimated by Pfankuch's index, species trait predictions were supported but the taxon richness prediction was not. A co-inertia analysis, searching for a co-structure between our environmental and faunistic data sets, allowed us to distinguish taxa that apparently are resistant to bed movement from tara that appear to be resistant to flow variations; this more detailed analysis indicates that the most appropriate measure of disturbance may vary even among quite closely related taxa. The construction of a comprehensive theory of disturbance in streams requires that disturbance is quantified in a way that allows both multi-site and multi-study comparisons. The painted-particle approach, described here, has the potential to permit such standarized comparative studies.",10.2307/1468142,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,"couldn't access pdf, have requested from author",

Little is known about changes in life-history traits that may be responsible for the recent population decline of White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca deglandi). Therefore, we studied nesting ecology of White-winged Scoters at Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan, during the summers of 2000-2001. We found 198 nests and examined nest-site selection by comparing habitat features of successful nests, depredated nests, and random sites. Discriminant function analysis differentiated habitat features-measured at hatch-of successful nests, deprecated nests, and random sites; lateral (r = 0.66) and overhead (r = 0.35) concealment were microhabitat variables most correlated with canonical discriminant functions. We also modeled daily survival rate of nests as a function of year, linear and quadratic trends with nest age, nest initiation date, and seven microhabitat variables. Nest survival from a time-constant model (i.e. Mayfield nest-success estimate) was 0.35 (95% CL: 0.27, 0.43). Estimates of nest success were lower than those measured at Redberry Lake in the 1970s and 1980s. Nest survival increased throughout the laying period and stabilized during incubation, and showed positive relationships with nest concealment and distance to water and a negative relationship with distance to edge. Considering those factors, a model-averaged estimate of nest survival was 0.24 (95% CL: 0.09, 0.42). We concluded that White-winged Scoters selected nesting habitat adaptively, because (1) successful sites were more concealed than depreciated sites; (2) nest sites (both successful and depredated) had higher concealment than random sites; and (3) nest sites were on islands, where success is greater than on the mainland.",10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[0950:NEOWSM]2.0.CO;2,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The effects of stress or disturbance on aquatic systems are discussed in relation to the following questions:Can we predict the state and rate of recolonization after a disturbance? What are the strategies of recolonization developed by plants? How high is the resilience of a disturbed system? Two theories, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and the patch dynamics concept proposed to predict the composition, structure and dynamics of plants due to physical-chemical factors, were tested on two scales, that of communities and that of species, within two alluvial floodplains (the Rhine and the Rhone systems in France).With regard to the change of community on a larger scale (i.e. the whole network of the cut-off channels in the floodplain), large gradients of connection and disturbance induce high diversities within communities. Moreover, the highest flood disturbance induces a higher species richness and the occurrence of a particular species. The change in species is analysed using biological traits (morphological, reproductive or physiological). In the floodplain of the river Rhone, the response of plants corresponds well to theory, i.e. that habitats with an intermediate disturbance are richer than more or less disturbed habitats. So we can predict, through the biological traits, the functioning of a habitat. The last remaining question is that of the resilience of the system, which can be discussed in terms of species competition and the risk of biological invasion after an opening of habitat.",10.1007/BF02712119,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,didn't actually look at traits,

Our goal is to produce a list of plant species predictive of high taxonomic and functional biodiversity values and discuss their use within biodiversity monitoring programmes. We selected a representative sample of 48 vineyard areas from Southern Switzerland, and vegetation from the ground cover was sampled from within a total of 120 sampling plots. We considered ten widely used functional traits and selected six taxonomic and functional indices. We applied a two-step analysis: (i) using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) based on the above mentioned biodiversity indices, we defined 3 groups of sampling plots with low (L), medium (M) and high (H) biodiversity values; (ii) using the Indicator Value analysis, we identify indicator species that are significantly associated with the above-mentioned groups and their combinations. In total, 259 vascular plants were identified across the sampling plots. As a whole, 52 species were significant indicators for groups with high and mid-to-high biodiversity values. Out of all indicator species, 24 (46%) were exclusively selected by functional biodiversity indices whereas only 10 (19%) were associated with taxonomic indices. Eighteen (35% of the total) species were selected by both types of indices. We point out that indicator species associated with two different aspects of biodiversity show a high degree of complementarity. Our results emphasize the need to consider functional aspects of biodiversity in diversity-conservation strategies when the objectives are to preserve both taxonomic diversity and ecosystem functioning.

"Troost, TA; Kooi, BW; Kooijman, SALM",2007,Bifurcation analysis of ecological and evolutionary processes in ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Bifurcation theory is commonly used to study the dynamical behaviour of ecosystems. It involves the analysis of points in the parameter space where the stability of the system changes qualitatively Generally, such changes are related only to changes in environmental parameters, while the organism's trait values are assumed to be constant. In reality, however, these trait values also change, though on a longer (evolutionary) time scale. On an ecological time scale, such evolutionary changes often come down to mutants invading a resident population. Points in the trait space where invasibility changes correspond to transcritical bifurcations. Therefore, bifurcation theory may also be used to study the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems. First, the bifurctation approach is explained by analyzing a simple and well known Lotka-Volterra competition model where the competition coefficients and the carrying capacity are trait-dependent. However, the bifurcation approach is especially suitable for the analysis of more complex models. Therefore, the advantages and differences with the Adaptive Dynamics (AD) approach are discussed in more detail by means of the analysis of a more realistic and complex ecosystem model consisting of mixotrophic organisms.

Here, we document that two ecologically rather similar groups of epigeic predators, ground-dwelling spiders (Arancae) and ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), differ in patterns of stone quarry colonization. Such post-industrial barrens as abandoned quarries are increasingly appreciated as potential refuges for species that are becoming rare in modern landscapes. We compared species richness, community composition and species life-history traits of two epigeic invertebrates groups, in quarries and adjoining seminatural biotopes in submountain region with granulite and limestone bedrock in SW Czech Republic. For both groups, quarries were species-poorer than seminatural sites, herbacecous biotopes were richer than scrubby and rocky biotopes, and no significant effects on species richness were revealed for substrate. Assemblages colonising quarries differed from those outside of quarries. They contained numerous regionally rarer species of rocks and scree in the case of spiders, but generalists of open landscapes prevailed among ground beetles. A survey limited to ground beetles, as well as to species richness analyses, would fail to detect a conservation potential of the quarries.

Pursuing this hypothesis further, we used the minimum model to design and analyse a mesocosm experiment, studying the effect of high (+Z) and low (-Z) copepod density on resource allocation, along an organic-C addition gradient. In the Arctic, both effects are plausible due to changes in advection patterns (affecting copepods) and meltwater inputs (affecting carbon). The model predicts a trophic cascade from copepods via ciliates to flagellates, which was confirmed experimentally. Auto-and heterotrophic flagellates affect bacterial growth rate and abundance via competition for mineral nutrients and predation, respectively. In +Z, the model predicts low bacterial abundance and activity, and little response to glucose; as opposed to clear glucose consumption effects in -Z. We observed a more resilient bacterial response to high copepods and demonstrate this was due to changes in bacterial community equitability. Species able to use glucose to improve their competitive and/or defensive properties, became predominant. The observed shift from a SAR11-to a Psychromonodaceae - dominated community suggests the latter was pivotal in this modification of ecosystem function. We argue that this group used glucose to improve its defensive or its competitive abilities (or both). Adding such flexibility in bacterial traits to the model, we show how it creates the observed resilience to top-down manipulations observed in our experiment.",10.1038/s41396-018-0217-7,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

This is the first food-web model representing the Aegean Sea, and results were presented and discussed in comparison to other previous ecosystems modelled from the western and the central areas of the basin (South Catalan and North-Central Adriatic Seas). Forty functional groups were defined, covering the entire trophic spectrum from lower to higher trophic levels. Emphasis was placed on commercial invertebrates and fish. The potential ecological role of the invasive ctenophore, Mnerniopsis leidyi, and several vulnerable groups (e.g., dolphins) was also explored. Results confirmed the spatial productivity patterns known for the Mediterranean Sea showing, for example, that the total biomass is highest in N.C. Adriatic and lowest in N. Aegean Sea. Accordingly, food-web flows and several ecosystem indicators like the mean transfer efficiency were influenced by these patterns. Nevertheless, all three systems shared some common features evidencing similarities of Mediterranean Sea ecosystems such as dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and strong benthic pelagic coupling of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. The importance of detritus highlighted the role of the microbial food-web, which was indirectly considered through detritus dynamics. Ciliates, mesozooplankton and several benthic invertebrate groups were shown as important elements of the ecosystem linking primary producers and detritus with higher trophic levels in the N. Aegean Sea. Adult anchovy was shown as the most important fish group in terms of production, consumption and overall effect on the rest of the ecological groups in the model, in line with results from the Western Mediterranean Sea. The five fishing fleets considered (both artisanal and industrial) had high impacts on vulnerable species and numerous targeted groups given the multispecies nature of the fisheries in the N. Aegean Sea. Several exploitation indices highlighted that the N. Aegean Sea ecosystem was highly exploited and unlikely to be sustainably fished, similarly to other Mediterranean marine ecosystems.

"Tsunoda, T; van Dam, NM",2017,Root chemical traits and their roles in belowground biotic interactions,PEDOBIOLOGIA,"One of the greatest challenges in soil ecology is to understand the mechanisms underlying the composition of complex soil communities. The members of these communities are not evenly distributed in soils; instead, soil organisms interact dynamically with biotic and abiotic factors which distribute heterogeneously in soil. Root chemical traits are key factors shaping belowground rhizosphere communities, because they mediate species-specific interactions, affect organisms at multiple trophic levels and, consequently, diverse ecological processes. This review explores the role of root chemical traits in shaping belowground biotic interactions. We first summarize which soil organisms occur and interact over a distinct, vertical gradient in the rhizosphere, i.e., from taproots to fine roots and exudates. Then we explore whether the vertical interaction gradient between roots and soil biota co-occurs with gradients of root chemical traits. We particularly discuss whether and why allocations of defensive chemicals in roots are consistent with the optimal defence allocation theory, which provides a mechanistic understanding of specific detrimental interactions. In order to obtain more detailed data, appropriate sampling scales and methods are necessary to correctly recognize belowground biodiversity and biotic interactions mediated by root chemical traits. Metabolomic approaches which enable us to analyse and identify thousands of root chemicals at once, will help to identify those chemical root traits which are the most important in belowground biotic interactions.",10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.05.007,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,don't actually test anything,

Germination traits of seven closely related species from calcareous and siliceous habitats were characterised in the laboratory, including base, optimum and ceiling temperatures (T (b), T (o), T (c), respectively), base water-potential (I (b)) and the pH range of the germination phenotype. Species' vegetative traits (specific leaf area, leaf area and leaf dry matter content) were obtained from the TRY-database. Traits and habitat similarities and dissimilarities were assessed. Species were plotted in a multivariate space using two separate principal component analyses: one each for germination and vegetative traits. Species from calcareous habitats showed significantly higher T (b), lower I (b) and lower capacity to germinate under acidic pH than species from siliceous habitats. Moreover, high T (o) and T (c), a narrow temperature range for germination at dispersal, and vegetative traits values were similar across both habitats. Whilst plant traits seem to have adapted to the shared environmental conditions of the two alpine habitats, some germination traits were affected by the habitat differences.

Hibernation allows a diverse range of small mammals to exhibit seasonal dormancy, which might increase survival and consequently be associated with relatively slow life histories. We used phylogenetically informed GLS models to test for an effect of hibernation on seasonal and annual survival, and on key attributes of life histories among mammals. Monthly survival was in most cases higher during hibernation compared with the active season, probably because inactivity minimizes predation. Hibernators also have approximately 15 per cent higher annual survival than similar sized non-hibernating species. As predicted, we found an effect of hibernation on the relationships between life history attributes and body mass: small hibernating mammals generally have longer maximum life spans (50% greater for a 50 g species), reproduce at slower rates, mature at older ages and have longer generation times compared with similar-sized non-hibernators. In accordance with evolutionary theories, however, hibernating species do not have longer life spans than non-hibernators with similar survival rates, nor do they have lower reproductive rates than non-hibernators with similar maximum life spans. Thus, our combined results suggest that (i) hibernation is associated with high rates of overwinter and annual survival, and (ii) an increase in survival in hibernating species is linked with the coevolution of traits indicative of relatively slow life histories.",10.1098/rspb.2011.0190,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Previous analyses have made progress in testing these predictions and identifying underlying processes, but have also pointed to theoretical as well as methodological shortcomings. Here we applied a recently developed methodology for spatially explicit analysis of phylogenetic meta-community structure to study the pattern of co-occurrence of functional traits in Afrotropical and Neotropical bird species inhabiting forest fragments. Focusing separately on locomotory, dietary, and dispersal traits, we tested whether environmental filtering causes spatial clustering, or competition leads to spatial segregation as predicted by limiting similarity theory. We detected significant segregation of species co-occurrences in African fragments, but not in the Neotropical ones. Interspecific competition had a higher impact on trait co-occurrence than filter effects, yet no single functional trait was able to explain the observed degree of spatial segregation among species. Despite high regional variability spanning from spatial segregation to aggregation, we found a consistent tendency for a clustered spatial patterning of functional traits among communities in fragmented landscapes, particularly in non-territorial species. Overall, we show that behavioural effects, such as territoriality, and environmental effects, such as the area of forest remnants or properties of the landscape matrix in which they are embedded, can strongly affect the pattern of trait co-occurrence. Our findings suggest that trait-based analyses of community structure should include behavioural and environmental covariates, and we here provide an appropriate method for linking functional traits, species ecology and environmental conditions to clarify the drivers underlying spatial patterns of species co-occurrence.",10.1111/oik.04561,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Birds,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = beak shape, wing shape, tarsus, tail and wing length, and body mass",

Several studies have shown that populations in small and highly isolated habitat patches are prone to strong environmental and demographic stochasticity and increased risk of extinction. Based on community assembly theory, we predict recent rapid forest fragmentation to cause a decline in species and functional guild richness of forest birds combined with a high species turnover among habitat patches, and well defined dominance structures, if competition is the major driver of community assembly. To test these predictions, we analysed species co-occurrence, nestedness, and competitive strength to infer effects of interspecific competition, habitat structure, and species' traits on the assembly of bird species communities from 12 cloud forest fragments in southern Kenya. Our results do not point to a single ecological driver of variation in species composition. Interspecific competition does not appear to be a major driver of species segregation in small forest patches, while its relative importance appears to be higher in larger ones, which may be indicative for a generic shift from competition-dominated to colonisation-driven community structure with decreasing fragment size. Functional trait diversity was independent of fragment size after controlling for species richness. As fragmentation effects vary among feeding guilds and habitat generalists, in particular, tend to decline in low quality forest patches, we plead for taking species ecology fully into account when predicting tropical community responses to habitat change.",10.1371/journal.pone.0163338,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Birds,Tropical Rainforest,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,0,Habitat Degredation,0,0,1,1,"body mass (g), average bill culmen length, dispersal ability, depth and width (cm), tarsus, tail, and wing length (cm), and average hand-wing index.",

Phylogenetic and trait analyses are powerful tools for disentangling the mechanisms underlying the structure of plant and animal communities, and their use has become prominent in the last decade. However, few studies have simultaneously incorporated data on species traits or phylogeny, environment, and species co-occurrences. Therefore, the relative importance of these factors as drivers of community assembly is largely unknown. 2. We introduce new and conceptually simple null model tests and appropriate metrics to disentangle the relationships between species co-occurrence, traits or phylogeny and environmental factors not covered by available packages for phylogenetic analysis. We illustrate the methods with an extensive data set on understory plant assemblages sampled in three Polish forests. 3. Benchmark testing indicates that the proposed methods have good error behaviour when tested against a variety of artificial matrix sets covering a wide range of observed patterns. Test results are largely independent of matrix size and matrix fill and have adequate power to detect even weak patterns of non-randomness. The different metrics used are uncorrelated with one another and capture different, and often divergent, patterns expressed within the same matrix. 4.

"Urban, Mark C.",2007,The growth-predation risk trade-off under a growing gape-limited predation threat,ECOLOGY,"Growth is a critical ecological trait because it can determine population demography, evolution, and community interactions. Predation risk frequently induces decreased foraging and slow growth in prey. However, such strategies may not always be favored when prey can outgrow a predator's hunting ability. At the same time, a growing gape-limited predator broadens its hunting ability through time by expanding its gape and thereby creates a moving size refuge for susceptible prey. Here, I explore the rami. cations of growing gape-limited predators for adaptive prey growth. A discrete demographic model for optimal foraging/growth strategies was derived under the realistic scenario of gape-limited and gape-unconstrained predation threats. Analytic and numerical results demonstrate a novel fitness minimum just above the growth rate of the gape-limited predator. This local fitness minimum separates a slow growth strategy that forages infrequently and accumulates low but constant predation risk from a fast growth strategy that forages frequently and experiences a high early predation risk in return for lower future predation risk and enhanced fecundity. Slow strategies generally were advantageous in communities dominated by gape-unconstrained predators whereas fast strategies were advantageous in gape-limited predator communities. Results were sensitive to the assumed relationships between prey size and fecundity and between prey growth and predation risk. Predator growth increased the parameter space favoring fast prey strategies. The model makes the testable predictions that prey should not grow at the same rate as their gape-limited predator and generally should grow faster than the fastest growing gape-limited predator. By focusing on predator constraints on prey capture, these results integrate the ecological and evolutionary implications of prey growth in diverse predator communities and offer an explanation for empirical growth patterns previously viewed to be anomalies.",10.1890/06-1946.1,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = growth rate,

We also assess the congruence of these results with observed phylogenetic and functional structure in the neighbourhoods of live and dead trees. We found strong support for models in which the effects of spatial neighbourhood interactions on tree growth and survival were scaled to species-specific mean functional trait values (e.g., wood specific gravity, leaf succulence and maximum height) but not to phylogenetic distance. The weak phylogenetic signal in functional trait data allowed us to independently interpret the static neighbourhood functional and phylogenetic patterns. We observed greater functional trait similarity in the neighbourhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees suggesting that environmental filtering is the major force structuring this tree community at this scale while competitive interactions play a lesser role.",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01541.x,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Tropical Rainforest,1,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = leaf area (cm2), specific

Can post-fire conditions initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly?LocationGlacier National Park, Montana, USA.MethodsWe characterized the species composition of tree re-establishment following nine recent fires in the lower subalpine zone of Glacier National Park, a region with multiple co-dominant tree species that has experienced extensive fire in recent decades. We used GLMMs to describe individual species' responses to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of post-fire conditions and seed availability, and used multivariate approaches to examine whether post-fire conditions can initiate alternate trajectories of forest community assembly.ResultsPost-fire regeneration responses were strongly species-dependent and consistent with functional trait differences. We found that there was a brief opportunity for establishment during the first several years after fire, during which tree recruitment for all species was contingent upon the availability of nearby seeds and the occurrence of favourable weather conditions. There was a remarkable amount of compositional change following fire, and the majority of our study sites transitioned from a mixed forest to a tree assemblage dominated by a single species.ConclusionsDifferential species-specific responses to climate and disturbance can initiate alternate trajectories of community assembly, triggering substantial changes in forest composition. The composition of post-fire tree assemblages reflects the differential responses of individual species to climate and disturbance, providing support for the interacting role of dispersal and environmental filtering in shaping post-disturbance communities and highlighting the importance of incorporating functional traits into predictive models of ecosystem dynamics.",10.1111/jvs.12465,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,1,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = shade tolerance, drought tolerance, fire resistance, cone serotiny, min. reproductive age, avg. seed mass",

Relating species traits to habitat characteristics can provide important insights into the structure and functioning of stream communities. However, trade-offs among species traits make it difficult to predict accurately the functional diversity of freshwater communities. Many authors have pointed to the value of working with groups of organisms as similar as possible in terms of relationships among traits and have called for definition of groups of organisms with similar suites of attributes. 2. We used multivariate analyses to examine separately the relationships among 11 biological traits and among 11 ecological traits of 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa (mainly general. The main objective was to demonstrate (1) potential trade-offs among traits; (2) the importance of the different traits to separate systematic units or functional groupings; and (3) uniform functional groups of taxa that should allow a more effective use of macroinvertebrate biological and ecological traits. 3. We defined eight groups and 15 subgroups according to a biological trait ordination which highlighted size (large to small), reproductive traits (K to r strategists), food (animal to plant material) and feeding habits (predator to scraper and/or deposit feeder) as 'significant' factors determining the ordination of taxa. This ordination partly preserved phylogenetic relationships among groups. 4. Seven ecological groups and 13 ecological subgroups included organisms with combinations of traits which should be successively more adequate in habitats from the main channel to temporary waters, and from the crenon to the potamic sections of rivers, and to systems situated outside the river floodplain. These gradients corresponded to a gradual shift from (1) rheophilic organisms that lived in the main channel of cold oligotrophic mountain streams to (2) animals that preferred eutrophic habitats of still or temporary waters in lowlands. The groups with similar ecological traits had a more diverse systematic structure than those with similar biological traits. 5. Monitoring and assessment tools for the management of water resources are generally more effective if they are based on a clear understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the presence or absence of species groups in the environment.

Hence, knowledge of earthworm species associations and their interactions is important not only for an understanding of the functioning of soil systems and predicting the consequences of invasions of peregrine earthworms for native earthworm fauna, soil food web structure and functioning, but also for the structure and functioning of the aboveground food web. Over 60 studies investigating a total of 19 species and about 20 response variables were studied to summarize the scattered information on inter- and intraspecific interactions in lumbricids. Information on interactions between species is restricted to species pairs, while there is no data on species interactions within more complex associations. For further analysis, interactions were classified into positive and negative (i.e., those enhancing or decreasing the fitness of a given species). Based on this approach, ""interactive portraits"" (combinations of responses and effects) for six widespread species and for major ecological groups of earthworms were composed. Species and group characteristics were confirmed by meta-analysis. In multispecies communities, species strongly react to species composition and community structure with the mechanisms of species interactions likely being context-specific. Interactions between both species and ecological groups strongly affect soil biota and soil processes, with synergistic and neutralizing effects being most important. At the species level, lumbricids are among the few groups of soil invertebrates where density-dependent regulation of populations appears to be prevalent. These conclusions have important implications for the role of earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers in terrestrial systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

However, it is currently unclear whether this is achieved by competitively displacing native species from their niches and/or by exploiting niche opportunities not monopolized by native species. Combining phylogenetic analyses with field observations and an ecological opportunity experiment, we here contrasted the competition and niche opportunity hypotheses as explanations for the success of an alien passerine, the Red-billed Leiothrix Leiothrix lutea, in a forest reserve from the Western Mediterranean basin. The invasion of Leiothrix provided a rare opportunity to assess the relative importance of each hypothesis because the avian community of the reserve has been systematically surveyed for the last 27 years, and hence species abundance data were available before and after the irruption of the invader. The invader established itself with relatively little resistance or consequences for native species, reflecting the opportunist-generalist nature of both the invader and the invaded native community. Although we cannot completely discard a role of competition, these results yield greater support to the crucial importance of niche opportunities to invade natural environments.",10.1007/s10530-016-1246-7,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystem-specific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed.

Methods A research review of current concepts and information, providing a new perspective, supported by quantitative analysis of a global traits database. Results Continuous and process-based traitenvironment relations are central to a traits-based approach and allow us to directly calculate fluxes based on functional characteristics. By quantifying community assembly concepts, it is possible to predict trait values from environmental drivers, although these relations are still imperfect. Through the quantification of these relations, effects of adaptation and species replacement upon environmental changes are implicitly accounted for. Such functional links also allow direct calculation of fluxes, including those related to feedbacks through the nitrogen and water cycle. Finally, a traits-based model allows the prediction of new trait combinations and no-analogue ecosystem functions projected to arise in the near future, which is not feasible in current vegetation models. A separate calculation of ecosystem fluxes and PFT occurrences in traits-based models allows for flexible vegetation classifications.

Morphology, hopping, and development rate at metamorphosis",EVOLUTION,"Models for the evolution of plasticity predict that individuals having phenotypes induced by exposure to enemies should experience relatively low fitness when enemies are absent. However, costs of induced phenotypes have been difficult to find in both plants and animals, perhaps because costs are expressed at later stages in the life cycle. We searched for delayed costs of an induced defense in larvae of the water frog Rana ridibunda, which exhibits strong phenotypic responses to predators. Tadpoles grew to metamorphosis in outdoor artificial ponds, in either the presence or absence of Aeshna dragonfly larvae confined within cages. We collected metamorphs at forelimb emergence, estimated their development rate until tail resorption was complete, and measured their body and leg shape and hopping performance. Development rate through metamorphosis reflects the duration of a transitional period during which metamorphs are especially vulnerable to predators, and hopping performance may reflect ability to escape predators. Froglets from the dragonfly treatment lost mass through metamorphosis significantly faster than those from predator-free ponds, but they resorbed their tails at about the same rate, despite the fact that their tails were relatively large to begin with. Froglets developing from predator-induced tadpoles had shorter, more muscular legs, and hopped 5% longer distances (difference not significant). Therefore, producing an induced defense against insect predators during the tadpole stage did not exact a cost during or immediately after metamorphosis; if anything, tadpoles with the predator-induced phenotype gave rise to more vigorous froglets. These results focus attention on other costs of the induced phenotype, as well as alternative explanations for plasticity that do not rely on direct fitness trade-offs.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Many empirical tests assume that the interference among animals is independent of density and do not quantify the effects of density on fitness traits. Using two species of predatory mites, we measured oviposition as a function of conspecific density. Subsequently, we used these functions to calculate expected distributions on two connected patches. We performed an experimental test of the distributions of mites on two such connected patches, among which one had a food accessibility rate that was twice as high as on the other. For one of the two species, Iphiseius degenerans, the distribution matched the expected distribution. The distribution also coincided with the ratio of food accessibility. The other species, Neoseiulus cucumeris, distributed itself differently than expected. However, the oviposition rates of both species did not differ significantly from the expected oviposition rates based on experiments on single patches. This suggests that the oviposition rate of N. cucumeris was not negatively affected by the observed distribution, despite the fact that N. cucumeris did not match the predicted distributions. Thus, the distribution of one mite species, I. degenerans, was in agreement with IFD theory, whereas for the other mite species, N. cucumeris, unknown factors may have influenced the distribution of the mites.

It is not known which abiotic conditions at these sites drive the differences in community composition. A trait-based approach, which relates species traits to abiotic conditions, may provide insight in this relationship and improve conservation management of these characteristic communities. We used this approach to identify the following: (i) dominant abiotic conditions that shape plant communities at discharge sites and (ii) characteristic traits associated with these abiotic conditions. First, we performed a (qualitative) literature survey to relate plant traits to various abiotic conditions at discharge sites. Second, we performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively test the trait selection at discharge sites. For the meta-analysis, we compiled a species discharge preference database (n=170), based on literature and field data. We performed linear regression to relate traits to species discharge preference. Only 5 out of the 11 traits tested (low leaf phosphorus content, high leaf N:P, low rate of clonal reproduction, low maximum height and high seed mass) were significantly related to discharge preference, while the explained variance was low (R-2<0.09). Our results suggest the following: (i) Despite the inclusion of traits specifically related to prevailing local environmental conditions, beyond commonly applied traits, hardly any differences were revealed; this indicates a need for more comprehensive eco-physiological understanding (and information on the selection of combinations of traits).

"Van der Plas, F; Anderson, TM; Olff, H",2012,Trait similarity patterns within grass and grasshopper communities: multitrophic community assembly at work,ECOLOGY,"Trait-based community assembly theory suggests that trait variation among co-occurring species is shaped by two main processes: abiotic filtering, important in stressful environments and promoting similarity, and competition, more important in productive environments and promoting dissimilarity. Previous studies have indeed found trait similarity to decline along productivity gradients. However, these studies have always been done on single trophic levels. Here, we investigated how interactions between trophic levels affect trait similarity patterns along environmental gradients. We propose three hypotheses for the main drivers of trait similarity patterns of plants and herbivores along environmental gradients: (1) environmental control of both, (2) bottom-up control of herbivore trait variation, and (3) top-down control of grass trait variation. To test this, we collected data on the community composition and trait variation of grasses (41 species) and grasshoppers (53 species) in 50 plots in a South African savanna. Structural equation models were used to investigate how the range and spacing of within-community functional trait values of both grasses and their insect herbivores (grasshoppers; Acrididae) respond to (1) rainfall and fire frequency gradients and (2) the trait similarity patterns of the other trophic level. The analyses revealed that traits of co-occurring grasses became more similar toward lower rainfall and higher fire frequency (environmental control), while showing little evidence for top-down control. Grasshopper trait range patterns, on the other hand, were mostly directly driven by vegetation structure and grass trait range patterns (bottom-up control), while environmental factors had mostly indirect effects via plant traits.

"van der Plas, F; Janzen, T; Ordonez, A; Fokkema, W; Reinders, J; Etienne, RS; Olff, H",2015,A new modeling approach estimates the relative importance of different community assembly processes,ECOLOGY,"The relative importance of niche-based (e.g., competitive or stress-based) and stochastic (e.g., random dispersal) processes in structuring ecological communities is frequently analyzed by studying trait distributions of co-occurring species. While filtering processes, such as the exclusion of stress-intolerant species from particular habitats, increase the trait similarity between co-occurring species, other processes, such as resource competition, can limit the similarity of co-occurring species. Comparing the observed trait distribution patterns in communities to null expectations from randomized communities (e.g., a draw of the same observed richness from the regional pool) therefore gives a first indication of the dominant process driving community assembly. However, such comparisons do not inform us about the relative contribution of these different processes in shaping community compositions in case of their joint operation (a likely scenario). Using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach, we develop a new method that allows inference of the relative importance of dispersal, filtering, and limiting similarity processes for the assembly of observed communities with known species and trait composition. We applied this approach to a tree community data set, collected across 20 plots along strong rainfall and fire gradients in a South African savanna. Based on comparisons with simulations, we find that our new approach is powerful in identifying which community assembly scenario has the highest probability to generate the observed trait distribution patterns, while traditional null model comparisons perform poorly in detecting signs of limiting similarity. For the studied savanna tree communities, our analysis yields that dispersal processes are most important in shaping the functional trait distribution patterns. Furthermore, our models indicate that filtering processes were relatively most important in areas with high fire frequencies, while limiting similarity processes were relatively most important in areas with low fire frequency and high rainfall. We conclude that our new method is a promising improvement on current approaches to estimate the relative importance of community assembly processes across different species groups, ecosystems, and biomes.

H.",2017,Emergence of microbial diversity due to cross-feeding interactions in a spatial model of gut microbial metabolism,BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,"Background: The human gut contains approximately 1014 bacteria, belonging to hundreds of different species. Together, these microbial species form a complex food web that can break down nutrient sources that our own digestive enzymes cannot handle, including complex polysaccharides, producing short chain fatty acids and additional metabolites, e.g., vitamin K. Microbial diversity is important for colonic health: Changes in the composition of the microbiota have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity and Crohn's disease, and make the microbiota more vulnerable to infestation by harmful species, e.g., Clostridium difficile. To get a grip on the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut, we here propose a multi-scale, spatiotemporal dynamic flux-balance analysis model to study the emergence of metabolic diversity in a spatial gut-like, tubular environment. The model features genome-scale metabolic models (GEM) of microbial populations, resource sharing via extracellular metabolites, and spatial population dynamics and evolution.Results: In this model, cross-feeding interactions emerge readily, despite the species' ability to metabolize sugars autonomously. Interestingly, the community requires cross-feeding for producing a realistic set of short-chain fatty acids from an input of glucose, If we let the composition of the microbial subpopulations change during invasion of adjacent space, a complex and stratified microbiota evolves, with subspecies specializing on cross-feeding interactions via a mechanism of compensated trait loss. The microbial diversity and stratification collapse if the flux through the gut is enhanced to mimic diarrhea.Conclusions: In conclusion, this in silico model is a helpful tool in systems biology to predict and explain the controlling factors of microbial diversity in the gut.

"Van Looy, K; Piffady, J; Floury, M",2017,At what scale and extent environmental gradients and climatic changes influence stream invertebrate communities?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"In a context of increasing landscape modifications and climatic changes, scale hierarchy becomes an ever more crucial issue to integrate in the analysis of drivers and stressors of biological communities, especially in river networks. To cope with this issue, we developed (i) spatial hierarchical models of functional diversity of stream invertebrate communities to assess the relative influence of local-vs. regional-scale factors in structuring community assembly, and (ii) analysis of metacommunity elements to determine the ecological processes behind the structuring. The spatial structuring of benthic invertebrate cominunities was investigated over 568 sites in South-eastern France. Community structure was mainly driven by the altitudinal gradient and spring flow variation at broad scales, with functional diversity gradually decreasing with elevation and being maximized at intermediate levels of flow variability. According to the 'elements of metacommunity structure' analysis, the prevailing influence of the altitudinal gradient was also supported by a Clenientsian structuration of invertebrate communities. Conversely, the influence of observed climatic changes in temperature and rainfall was weak and observed only at fine scales. As a result, natural environmental filters were stronger drivers of the functional diversity of communities than human-induced stressors (e.g. water pollution and hydromorphological alterations). More broadly, our results suggest that management needs to embrace the possibilities of gathering high spatial and taxonomical resolution data when analysing and predicting flow variation and climate change effects in order to preserve and restore functionally diverse communities. Moreover, to develop environmental flow schemes or restoration and climate change adaptation strategies for freshwater communities, local and regional processes need to be addressed simultaneously; equally responsible as drivers of community diversity.

"Van Looy, K; Tormos, T; Souchon, Y",2014,Disentangling dam impacts in river networks,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Damming is one of the most widespread impairments of river systems around the world. The formulation of scientifically justified guidelines for restoration and remediation of impairments requires better understanding of the relationships between alteration and stream condition. The present study examines relationships between the presence and density of dams and biological metrics of river health in the context of a variety of environmental drivers over the Loire river basin. We hypothesized that dam density measured at supra-reach level would show more significant influence on river health than the local level density, and further that the impact of dams is best estimated with measures for the functional traits of biotic assemblages. An extensive dataset of fish (169 sites) and invertebrate (211 sites) communities in the Loire river basin, described with metrics of density of ecological guilds, taxonomic richness and life history traits, and coupled with reach hydromorphology and catchment characteristics was constructed. Generalized linear modeling was performed in order to quantify dam impact and investigate the importance of regional- and local-scale measures of dam density to the structure of biotic communities. The analysis showed that community structure at the basin scale responded significant to dam presence and confirmed that the strongest relationships were observed for specific functional trait-based metrics. For the macroinvertebrates the observed impact counts up to 25% of the variance in the trait-based quality indices, whereas for fish communities the dam density only explains up to 12%. Macroinvertebrate responses were stronger at higher scale level, and especially the upstream context explained on its own 70% of the observed impairment. For fish communities, the local context prevails and explained up to 70% of the dam impact. These results can be explained by the biotic processes ruling community assembly in the specific groups, passive dispersal for the invertebrates and migrations between habitats for fish. The geographic context furthermore explains the differentiation in these responses, reflecting the metacommunity structure of invertebrate assembly over the river basin. We conclude that for upstream parts of the river basin, locally based management actions can be successful in restoring biotic integrity, whereas more downstream, dam removal actions require more integrated measures at regional rather than local scale.

However, the processes and mechanisms behind the predicted threats remain uncertain. From long-term series of benthic invertebrate samples from temperate rivers and streams in France, we analyzed diversity and composition shifts over time in relation to geographic elements and human stressors. Mechanisms for community changes were investigated with a trait-based analysis for the entire dataset and for a selected caddisfly community module. We observed a 42% increase in the taxonomic richness of stream invertebrate communities over the last 25 years. A gradual trend induced by water quality improvement was distinguished from a more abrupt climate change-induced shift in communities around the year 2000. Trophic amplification - the intensification of trophic interactions and pathways through the food web was identified as the mechanism behind the strong community shift. Four lines of evidence for this trophic amplification are highlighted: (i) higher dissolved oxygen concentrations indicated a shift in primary production, (ii) the trait-based analysis of entire communities showed a bottom-up food web amplification, (iii) the trait-based analysis of the community module evidenced feeding strategy shifts and increased food web interactions, and (iv) the abundance analysis of the community module showed a productivity increase.

Differences in FD and species richness between the types were considerable and correlations between FD and species richness were strongly positive, suggesting that species-rich systems generally have higher FD and thus offer better ecosystem services. Green roof systems that comprise only succulents have significant lower FD values compared to systems containing more diverse vegetation. Within the green roof types there was room for improvement of FD. Based on a species trait dissimilarity matrix, species lists that maximize FD for every green roof type were created. FD analysis of novel ecosystems enables the design of both species-poor and species-rich green roof systems with improved overall ecosystem services value. The described approach is generic in nature and can be used for a broad range of novel ecosystems and urban green elements. We believe that designing functional diverse plant systems will support a more sustainable urban planning and improve the quality of urban life. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Van Regenmortel, Tina; Van de Perre, Dimitri; Janssen, Colin R.; De Schamphelaere, Karel A. C.",2018,"The effects of a mixture of copper, nickel, and zinc on the structure and function of a freshwater planktonic community",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"It is generally assumed that as long as the majority of species experiences no direct adverse effects attributable to a single substance (i.e., potentially affected fraction [PAF] <5%), no significant structural or functional effects at the community level are expected to occur. Whether this assumption holds for mixed metal contamination is not known. In the present study, we tested this by performing a microcosm experiment in which a naturally occurring freshwater planktonic community was exposed to a copper-nickel-zinc (Cu-Ni-Zn) mixture for 8 wk and various structural and functional community-level traits were assessed. In the low mixture concentration treatments (i.e., Ni-Zn mixtures, because there was no difference in Cu concentrations in these treatments with the control), community-level effects were relatively simple, only involving phytoplankton species groups. In the high mixture concentration treatments (Cu-Ni-Zn mixtures), community-level effects were more complex, involving several phytoplankton and zooplankton species groups. Multisubstance PAF (msPAF) values for all mixture treatments were calculated by applying the concentration addition model to bioavailability-normalized single-metal species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Consistent effects on the structural traits community composition, abundance of zooplankton species groups, species diversity, and species richness and on the functional trait dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (as a proxy for the microbial loop and pelagic food web interactions) were only observed at msPAF values >0.05 (i.e., in the Cu-Ni-Zn mixture). However, consistent effects on the abundance of various phytoplankton species groups (structural traits) and on 2 measures of community respiration, overnight dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH (functional traits), were already observed at msPAF values of 0.05 (i.e., in the Ni-Zn mixture). This indicates that the threshold msPAF value of 0.05 was not protective against metal mixture exposure for all community-level structural and functional endpoints in the present study. A possible explanation for this result is the mismatch between the species in the SSD and those in our microcosm community. Indeed, our data suggest that the presence of one single dominant and very Zn- and/or Ni-sensitive species in the investigated community (i.e., a cyanobacteria of the genus Oscillatoria), which is not represented in the SSD of these metals, was probably the driver of all observed effects at or below an msPAF of 0.05. Overall, the present results show that SSDs are not necessarily a good predictor of community-level effects for all types of communities and that the presence of dominant sensitive species may result in significant, consistent effects on certain structural and functional community-level endpoints at msPAF values 0.05, which is generally considered protective in many regulatory frameworks.

Equal proportions of five genotypes of the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), with none, resistance to dimethyl-carbamates, resistance to pyrethroids or combinations conferring resistance to both chemical classes were released into potato field plots. The insecticides were sprayed separately onto these plots, the aphid populations were analysed after 68 days and the process repeated. RESULTS: For each assessment after the three separate spray events, plots treated with the carbamate had 48, 147 and 28%, those treated with pyrethroid 53, 210 and 89%, those treated with carbamate/pyrethroid 28, 108 and 64% and those treated with neonicotinoid 43, 55 and 11% of the numbers of M. persicae by comparison with untreated controls. Only the proportions of surviving aphids from the genotype containing no insecticide resistance traits and the genotype containing elevated carboxylesterases matched ratios predicted from the selective advantage afforded by the resistance traits alone. Survival of aphids from the other three genotypes that carried 13 of the insecticide resistance traits differed from expectations in all cases, possibly owing to physiological differences, including their vulnerability to predators and hymenopterous parasitoids present at the site and/or their carrying unknown insecticide resistance mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Control strategies based on knowledge of the genetically determined insecticide resistance profile of an M. persicae population alone are insufficient. Hence, other important factors contributing to aphid survival under insecticide pressure need to be considered.

Interpreting and reconciling these contradictions has been challenging due to the inherent complexity of model dynamics, defying mathematical analysis and mechanistic understanding. We develop a new approach here, based on the Geber method for deconstructing eco-evolutionary dynamics, for gaining such understanding. We apply this approach to a co-evolutionary predator-prey model to disentangle the processes leading to either antiphase or 1/4-lag cycles. Our analysis reveals how the predator-prey phase relationship is driven by the temporal synchronization between prey biomass and defense dynamics. We further show when and how prey biomass and trait dynamics become synchronized, resulting in antiphase cycles, allowing us to explain and reconcile previous modelling and empirical predictions. The successful application of our proposed approach provides an important step towards a comprehensive theory on eco-evolutionary feedbacks in predator-prey systems.",10.1038/s41598-017-17019-4,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Van Zandt, Peter A.",2007,"Plant defense, growth, and habitat: A comparative assessment of constitutive and induced resistance",ECOLOGY,"The growth rate (GR) hypothesis relates the evolution of plant defense to resource availability and predicts that plants that have evolved in abiotically stressful environments grow inherently more slowly and are more constitutively resistant to herbivory than plants from more productive habitats. Stress-adapted plants are also predicted to have reduced inducibility, but this prediction has not been previously tested. To evaluate this hypothesis, I compared the growth of nine species of herbaceous plants from Missouri glade habitats to congeners from more productive non-glade habitats. I also conducted bioassays using larvae of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera exigua to estimate constitutive and inducible resistance in these congeners. Glade congeners tended to grow more slowly and have higher constitutive resistance and lower inducibility than non-glade species. However, none of these comparisons was statistically significant due to the conflicting response of one congeneric pair (Salvia azurea and S. lyrata). Analyses Without this genus were consistent with the GR hypothesis, as were analyses that categorized congeners by relative growth rate. These results highlight the complexity in searching for factors that determine plant growth rates and resistance traits across multiple genera and support the hypothesis that both constitutive and induced resistance may be influenced by selection on traits that alter plant growth rates. Future studies should attempt to determine whether variation in inducibility is better explained by habitat or relative plant growth rates.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

These models have greatly influenced the thinking on geographical range limits and have broad implications for ecology, evolution, and conservation. However, empirical tests of the models have rarely investigated comprehensive sets of population properties. We studied population size and density and a broad set of fitness-related traits in 66 populations of the alpine thistle Carduus defloratus along a latitudinal (615 km) and altitudinal (342-2300 m) gradient from the European Alps in the south to the northern range limit in the low mountain ranges of central Germany. Regression analysis indicated that population size and plant density declined with decreasing altitude from the center to the range margin, but plant size increased. In spite of the larger size of plants, the number of seeds produced strongly declined toward the range margin, mainly due to an increase in seed abortion. The number of flowering plants in a population influenced all components of reproduction. Plants in large populations initiated more seeds, aborted fewer seeds, and produced more and larger seeds per plant. The probability that seeds were attacked by insect larvae and the proportion of seeds damaged decreased strongly from the center to the margin of the distribution. However, in spite of the much lower level of parasitization, plants at the range margin produced far fewer viable seeds.

Here, we address this caveat by evaluating the effects of non-native tree species, in comparison to native ones, on several categories of cultural services, i.e., recreation and ecotourism, aesthetics, inspiration, and cultural heritage. We propose an indicator-based approach that includes the use of a meta-analysis statistics, the odds ratio, to evaluate photographic, internet and catalogue data, and to infer on the effects of non-native trees on cultural services. We apply our approach to the Iberian Peninsula, exploring potential environmental and socioeconomic predictors of non-native tree effects across NUTS-2 administrative regions. Overall, non-native tree effects differed among categories of cultural services and varied with the data type. Non-native trees increased recreation and ecotourism services, when considering data from official tourism entities, but not from nature route users. Data from inventories of urban parks and catalogues of ornamental plant dealers suggested that non-native trees decreased aesthetics services, particularly in Spain, but not in Portugal. Non-native trees also increased cultural heritage services, but no significant effects were observed on inspiration services. Overall, non-native trees showed higher increases in cultural services across regions with lower levels of development (in terms of income, employment and education) and life satisfaction. We suggest that management should emphasise awareness on non-native trees, including the risks involved in promoting the expansion of potentially invasive species. Efforts to raise awareness should prioritise official tourism entities and ornamental plant dealers, with a special focus on less developed regions. Our proposed approach represents a pioneer assessment of the relations between non-native trees and cultural ecosystem services, supporting strategic management in Iberia.

"Velasquez, J; Sanchez, JA",2015,Octocoral Species Assembly and Coexistence in Caribbean Coral Reefs,PLOS ONE,"Background What are the determinant factors of community assemblies in the most diverse ecosystem in the ocean? Coral reefs can be divided in continental (i.e., reefs that develop on the continental shelf, including siliciclastic reefs) and oceanic (i.e., far off the continental shelf, usually on volcanic substratum); whether or not these habitat differences impose community-wide ecological divergence or species exclusion/coexistence with evolutionary consequences, is unknown. Methods Studying Caribbean octocorals as model system, we determined the phylogenetic community structure in a coral reef community, making emphasis on species coexistence evidenced on trait evolution and environmental feedbacks. Forty-nine species represented in five families constituted the species pool from which a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using mtDNA. We included data from 11 localities in the Western Caribbean (Colombia) including most reef types. To test diversity-environment and phenotype-environment relationships, phylogenetic community structure and trait evolution we carried out comparative analyses implementing ecological and evolutionary approaches. Results Phylogenetic inferences suggest clustering of oceanic reefs (e.g., atolls) contrasting with phylogenetic overdispersion of continental reefs (e.g., reefs banks). Additionally, atolls and barrier reefs had the highest species diversity (Shannon index) whereas phylogenetic diversity was higher in reef banks. The discriminant component analysis supported this differentiation between oceanic and continental reefs, where continental octocoral species tend to have greater calyx apertures, thicker branches, prominent calyces and azooxanthellate species. This analysis also indicated a clear separation between the slope and the remaining habitats, caused by the presence or absence of Symbiodinium. K statistic analysis showed that this trait is conserved as well as the branch shape. Discussion There was strong octocoral community structure with opposite diversity and composition patterns between oceanic and continental reefs. Even habitats with similar depths and overall environmental conditions did not share similar communities between oceanic and continental reefs. This indicates a strong regional influence over the local communities, probably due to water transparency differences between major reef types, i.e., oceanic vs. continental shelf-neritic. This was supported by contrasting patterns found in morphology, composition and evolutionary history of the species between atolls and reef banks.",10.1371/journal.pone.0129609,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

However, whether impulsivity predates the development of uncontrollable feeding is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that a high impulsivity trait precedes and confers vulnerability for food addiction-like behavior. For this purpose, we trained ad libitum-fed male Wistar rats in a differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) task to select Low- and High-impulsive rats. Then, we allowed Low- and High-impulsive rats to self-administer a highly palatable diet (Palatable group) or a regular chow diet (Chow group) in 1-h daily sessions, under fixed ratio (FR) I, FR3, FR5, and under a progressive ratio (PR) schedules of reinforcement. In addition, we tested the compulsiveness for food in Low- and High-impulsive rats by measuring the food eaten in the aversive, open compartment of a light/dark conflict test. Finally, we measured the expression of the transcription factor Delta FosB in the shell and the core of the nucleus accumbens, which is a marker for neuroadaptive changes following addictive drug exposure. The data we obtained demonstrate that impulsivity is a trait that predicts the development of food addiction-like behaviors, including: (i) excessive intake, (ii) heightened motivation for food, and (iii) compulsive-like eating, when rats are given access to highly palatable food. In addition, we show that the food addiction phenotype in high impulsive subjects is characterized by an increased expression of the transcription factor Delta FosB in the nucleus accumbens shell. These results reveal that impulsivity confers an increased propensity to develop uncontrollable overeating of palatable food.",10.1038/npp.2014.98,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Spatial patterns of biodiversity are of central interest in ecology and evolution for several reasons: to identify general patterns in nature (e.g. species-area relationships, latitudinal gradients), to inform conservation priorities (e.g. identifying hotspots, prioritizing management efforts) and to draw inferences about processes, historical or otherwise (e.g. adaptation, the centre of origin of particular clades). There are long traditions in ecology and evolutionary biology of examining spatial patterns of biodiversity among species (i.e. in multispecies communities) and within species, respectively, and there has been a recent surge of interest in studying these two types of pattern simultaneously. The idea is that examining both levels of diversity can materially advance the above-stated goals and perhaps lead to entirely novel lines of inquiry. Here, we review two broad categories of approach to merging studies of inter- and intraspecific variation: (i) the study of phenotypic trait variation along environmental gradients and (ii) the study of relationships between patterns of molecular genetic variation within species and patterns of distribution and diversity across species. For the latter, we report a new meta-analysis in which we find that correlations between species diversity and genetic diversity are generally positive and significantly stronger in studies with discrete sampling units (e.g. islands, lakes, forest fragments) than in studies with nondiscrete sampling units (e.g. equal-area study plots).

However, the concept of stochasticity presents several profound philosophical, theoretical and empirical challenges, which we address here. The philosophical argument that nothing in nature is truly stochastic can be met with the following operational concept of neutral stochasticity in community ecology: change in the composition of a community (i.e. community dynamics) is neutrally stochastic to the degree that individual demographic events - birth, death, immigration, emigration - which cause such changes occur at random with respect to species identities. Empirical methods for identifying the stochastic component of community dynamics or structure include null models and multivariate statistics on observational species-by-site data (with or without environmental or trait data), and experimental manipulations of stochastic' species colonization order or relative densities and frequencies of competing species. We identify the fundamental limitations of each method with respect to its ability to allow inferences about stochastic community processes. Critical future needs include greater precision in articulating the link between results and ecological inferences, a comprehensive theoretical assessment of the interpretation of statistical analyses of observational data, and experiments focusing on community size and on natural variation in species colonization order. <boxed-text content-type=""all"" position=""float""> Synthesis Community structure and dynamics have often been described as being underlain by stochastic' or neutral' processes, but there is great confusion as to what exactly this means.

"Venable, DL",1996,Packaging and provisioning in plant reproduction,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Plane reproductive ecologists investigate many aspects of reproductive design not covered by simple offspring size/number models or simple sex allocation models, such as inflorescence design, pollen packaging or fruit design. General models for hierarchical packaging of reproductive allocation which cover these and other cases are developed here. These demonstrate that selection will tend to equalize fitness elasticities of reproductive components when these are properly scaled to take account of reproductive costs. Elasticities are defined as the proportional change in a fitness component with a proportional change in the trait contributing to that component (e.g. the proportional change in the fitness per seed with a proportional change in seed size). For the simplest reproductive design models, selection will favour the equalization of the elasticities of all female hierarchical provisioning and packaging fitness components or all male packaging components, both in single sex models or cosexual models. For simple cosexual models, selection favours allocation to each sex in proportion to the gender-specific fitness elasticities. More generally, selection tends to equalize all component elasticities when these are properly scaled to account for the total resource costs of changes in each component. The models are extended to cover more complex biology, including links between female and male packaging components, packaging components that contribute to the fitness of both genders, accessory costs that may or may not contribute to both genders, and allometric costs and trade-offs. As assumptions about fitness interactions and life history trade-offs become less restrictive, the models more closely approach a general equal-marginal-advantage model. The models provide tools for understanding how and when different components of the reproductive design constrain and selectively impact each other. The utility of the model for aiding in the design and analysis of specific research problems is discussed with reference to some empirical examples.",10.1098/rstb.1996.0115,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Quantitative information is scarce about how defensive traits perform, interact and become functionally integrated. Moreover, there are few studies that have combined performance and phylogenetic information to detect patterns of trait assembly and trends in defense efficacy. Using field demonstrations of effectiveness and phylogenetic reconstructions, we evaluated patterns of trait precedence and suite assembly by comparing the larval defenses of two beetles, Acromis sparsa and Chelymorpha alternans, which both feed on the leaf surfaces of the same plant, have shields containing host-derived deterrent chemicals and form aggregations. Additionally, female A. sparsa guard their larvae. Using an ecologically relevant bioassay, we quantified the extent to which: (1) gregariousness, size, maternal care and shields affected survival; (2) defenses interacted, and; (3) derived traits and suites outperformed ancestral ones. Regression models ranked traits revealing synergistic interactions. Shields interacted with gregariousness to form the strongest suite. Maternal care contributed to overall higher survival in A. sparsa, an advantage lost after female removal. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed a sequence of trait accumulation and suite formation. The combined performance-phylogenetic approach revealed: (1) multi-trait interactions amplified effectiveness; (2) a sequence of novel trait origins was followed by suite assembly, and; (3) an incremental trend in defense efficacy congruent with escalation.

This approach allowed us to describe the trait-environment relationship and provides an intuitive matrix of environment by trait interaction coefficients. We could then quantify the strength and direction of associations between plant traits, species life-forms and environmental factors in two alpine plant communities over nine years post-fire. Initially, the fire drastically reduced vegetation cover and species density to very low levels. The fourth-corner analysis interaction coefficients indicated that over the course of the nine-year study a high abundance of graminoids, a low abundance of shrubs, tall species and those with high leaf dry matter content had the strongest associations with the two plant communities.

A positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship is one of the most robust patterns in macroecology. Yet, the mechanisms driving this pattern are poorly understood. Here, we use biological traits of freshwater macroinvertebrates to gain a mechanistic understanding and disentangle the various explanations. We ask whether mechanisms underlying the abundance-occupancy relationship differ between species, and whether information on individual species can be used to explain their contribution to the interspecific relationship. 2. We test the hypothesis that the importance of metapopulation dynamics or niche differences in explaining the relationship differs between species, varying in relation to their habitat breadth. In addition, we analyse how a species' biological traits shape its habitat breadth and its abundance and occupancy. 3. The abundance and occupancy of the 234 different aquatic macroinvertebrate species were strongly and positively related. Marked differences were found between habitat specialists and habitat generalists in the goodness-of-fit of abundance-occupancy relationships. The occupancy-frequency distribution was bimodal for habitat generalists, allowing 'satellite species' to be distinguished from 'core species'. 4. Habitat generalists appeared to be more widespread but less abundant than habitat specialists, suggesting that the jack-of-all-trades may be master-of-none. Species traits (trophic position and other life-history traits) explained a significant part of the variation around the general relationship. Among habitat specialists, more species showed synchronized life cycles, a low dispersal capacity or clustered oviposition, being better adapted to predictable habitats. Among habitat generalists, more species had long-lived adults, spreading reproductive effort in time and space, and were strong dispersers, being better adapted to unpredictable habitats. 5. Interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships can be best understood by examining the contribution of individual species. For habitat specialists, the interplay between niche differences (diet and habitat use) and the underlying spatial distribution of environmental conditions result in competitive displacement and differences in species' success. For habitat generalists, differences in colonization and extinction rates between species are more important. Therefore, both metapopulation dynamics and niche differences can operate simultaneously but apply to different species, thus constituting different endpoints of the same continuum.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01660.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Other,Wetland,0,0,0,1,1,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = life-history strategy, actvie dispersal, rate of juvenile development, adult longevity, synchronization of juvenile development, synchronization of adult mergernce, type of oviposition, clutch size, high voltinism, hermaphroditism, asexual reproduction, diet",

We argue that within food webs, the negative scaling of abundance with body mass and foraging theory predict that the selective advantages of larger egg size should be smaller for sit-and-wait than active-hunting generalist predators, leading to the evolution of a difference in egg size between them. Because body mass usually scales negatively with predator abundance and constrains predation rate, slightly increasing egg mass should simultaneously allow offspring to feed on more prey and escape from more predators.However, the benefits of larger offspring would be relatively smaller for sit-and-wait predators because (i) due to their lower mobility, encounters with other predators are less common, and (ii) they usually employ a set of alternative hunting strategies that help to subdue relatively larger prey. On the other hand, for active predators, which need to confront prey as they find them, body-size differences may be more important in subduing prey. This difference in benefits should lead to the evolution of larger egg sizes in active-hunting relative to sit-and-wait predators. This prediction was confirmed by a phylogenetically controlled analysis of 268 spider species, supporting the view that the structure of ecological networks may serve to predict relevant selective pressures acting on key life history traits.",10.1111/jeb.12647,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

This contrasts with natural vegetation, in which many plant traits vary systematically along geographic and environmental gradients. In the JSBACH DGVM, which is part of the MPI-ESM, we allowed three traits (specific leaf area (SLA), maximum carboxylation rate at 25 degrees C (Vcmax(25)) and maximum electron transport rate at 25 degrees C (Jmax(25))) to vary within PFTs via trait-climate relationships based on a large trait database. The R-adjusted(2) of these relationships were up to 0.83 and 0.71 for Vcmax(25) and Jmax(25), respectively. For SLA, more variance remained unexplained, with a maximum R-adjusted(2) of 0.40. Compared to the default simulation, allowing trait variation within PFTs resulted in gross primary productivity differences of up to 50% in the tropics, in > 35% different dominant vegetation cover, and a closer match with a natural vegetation map. The discrepancy between default trait values and natural trait variation, combined with the substantial changes in simulated vegetation properties, together emphasize that incorporating climate-driven trait variation, calibrated on observational data and based on ecological concepts, allows more variation in vegetation responses in DGVMs and as such is likely to enable more reliable projections in unknown climates.",unkown_29,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,1,1,1,0,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"traits = specific leaf area (SLA), maximum carboxylation rate at 25 degrees C (Vcmax(25)) and maximum electron transport rate at 25 degrees C (Jmax(25)))",

This study evaluated trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence assembly patterns in successional areas of Araucaria forest. Plant species were sampled in both the upper and lower strata and were described by 15 functional traits. Data analyses were based on multiplication and Procrustes adjustment of matrices, which permit to discriminate trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence assembly patterns along the forest succession (our environmental variable), and the influence of phylogeny on these patterns. Initial and late forests were highly different in species composition, but the regenerating stratum was already more similar especially in functional terms. Traits related to the acquisitive-conservative trade-off (wood density, leaf nitrogen content, leaf area, leaf dry matter content) revealed strong convergent patterns of successional changes. Moreover divergence was maximized by specific leaf area, seed mass, deciduousness, and dispersal mode, showing a higher functional diversity in late Araucaria forests.

Despite the importance of these seasonally dry ecosystems (SDEs) for the global carbon cycling and in providing ecosystem services, a unifying ecohydrological framework to interpret the effects of climatic variability on SDEs is still lacking. A synthesis of existing data about plant functional adaptations in SDEs, covering some 400 species, shows that leaf phenological variations, rather than physiological traits, provide the dominant control on plant-water-carbon interactions. Motivated by this result, the combined implications of leaf phenology and climatic variability on plant water use strategies are here explored with a minimalist model of the coupled soil water and plant carbon balances. The analyses are extended to five locations with different hydroclimatic forcing, spanning seasonally dry tropical climates (without temperature seasonality) and Mediterranean climates (exhibiting out of phase seasonal patterns of rainfall and temperature). The most beneficial leaf phenology in terms of carbon uptake depends on the climatic regime: evergreen species are favoured by short dry seasons or access to persistent water stores, whereas high inter-annual variability of rainy season duration favours the coexistence of multiple drought-deciduous phenological strategies. We conclude that drought-deciduousness may provide a competitive advantage in face of predicted declines in rainfall totals, while reduced seasonality and access to deep water stores may favour evergreen species.

LocationGlobal. MethodsMeta-analysis and phylogenetic regressions based on 216 studies were used to examine the effects of 96 non-native plant species on species richness of resident plants and animals while considering differences in non-native species traits (life-form, clonality or vegetative reproduction, and nitrogen-fixing ability) and characteristics of the invaded site (ecosystem type, insularity and climatic region). ResultsPlots with non-native plants had lower resident plant (-20.5%) and animal species richness (-26.4%) than paired uninvaded control plots. Nitrogen-fixing ability, followed by phylogeny and clonality were the best predictors of the magnitude of impacts of non-native plants on native plant species richness. Non-nitrogen-fixing and clonal non-native plants reduced species richness more than nitrogen-fixing and non-clonal invaders. However, life-form and characteristics of the invaded sites did not appear to be important. In the case of resident animal species richness, only the phylogenetic position of the non-native and whether invaded sites were islands or not influenced impacts, with a more pronounced decrease found on islands than mainlands. Main conclusionsThe presence of a phylogenetic signal on the magnitude of the impacts of non-native plants on resident plant and animal richness indicates that closely related non-native plants tend to have similar impacts. This suggests that the magnitude of the impact might depend on shared plant traits not explored in our study.

This is a sizable challenge, particularly in ecosystems transcending international borders, where monitoring and conservation of long-range migratory species and their habitats are logistically and financially problematic. Here, using tools borrowed from epidemiology, we elucidated common drivers underlying species declines within a marine ecosystem, much in the way epidemiological analyses evaluate risk factors for negative health outcomes to better inform decisions. Thus, we identified ecological traits and dietary specializations associated with species declines in a community of marine predators that could be reflective of ecosystem change. To do so, we integrated count data from winter surveys collected in long-term marine bird monitoring programs conducted throughout the Salish Seaa transboundary large marine ecosystem in North America's Pacific Northwest. We found that decadal declines in winter counts were most prevalent among pursuit divers such as alcids (Alcidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae) that have specialized diets based on forage fish, and that wide-ranging species without local breeding colonies were more prone to these declines. Although a combination of factors is most likely driving declines of diving forage fish specialists, we propose that changes in the availability of low-trophic prey may be forcing wintering range shifts of diving birds in the Salish Sea. Such a synthesis of long-term trends in a marine predator community not only provides unique insights into the types of species that are at risk of extirpation and why, but may also inform proactive conservation measures to counteract threatsinformation that is paramount for species-specific and ecosystem-wide conservation. Evaluacion de las Correlaciones Ecologicas de las Declinaciones de Aves Marinas para Informar a la Conservacion Marina Resumen La identificacion de los conductores del cambio ambiental en los grandes ecosistemas marinos es esencial para su conservacion y manejo efectivo. Esto es un reto bastante grande, particularmente en los ecosistemas que trascienden fronteras internacionales, cuando el monitoreo y la conservacion de especies migratorias de amplio rango y sus habitats son logistica y financieramente problematicos.

We extended such an ecomorphological approach to a multi-scale analysis of a Neotropical bat assemblage and its constituent guilds (aerial and gleaning insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores) to describe their structure at different spatial scales and determine the relative importance of inter-specific competition, habitat filtering, or stochastic processes shaping such structures. We measured the occupied morphological space (size) defined by wing and skull morphology independently and the nearest-neighbour distance (structure) among species within these spaces at each spatial scale. Observed patterns were compared with random expectations derived from null models for statistical inference. When controlling for species richness and regional sampling effects in the null models, we did not find a significant effect of spatial scale in the morphological structure of the studied bat assemblage and guilds. Morphological structure followed the same patterns across scales as those expected from random drawings of sample size alone. Similar results were obtained regardless of morphological complex (wing and skull) and guilds.

To address these issues, studies have been increasingly focusing on functions of fish that are linked to their main ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are indeed known to control other organisms through predation, mediate nutrient fluxes, and can act as ecosystem engineers. Here for each of the key functions played by fish, we present the functional traits that have already been used to assess them. We include traits measurable from observations on living individuals, morphological features measured on preserved organisms or traits categorized using information from the literature, and we discuss their respective advantages and limitations. We then list future research directions to foster a more complete functional approach for fish ecology that needs to incorporate functional traits describing, food provisioning and cultural services while accounting more frequently for intraspecific variability.

"Villellas, J; Garcia, MB",2013,The role of the tolerance-fecundity trade-off in maintaining intraspecific seed trait variation in a widespread dimorphic herb,PLANT BIOLOGY,"Coexistence of species with different seed sizes is a long-standing issue in community ecology, and a trade-off between fecundity and stress tolerance has been proposed to explain co-occurrence in heterogeneous environments. Here we tested an intraspecific extension of this model: whether such trade-off also explains seed trait variation among populations of widespread plants under stress gradients. We collected seeds from 14 populations of Plantago coronopus along the Atlantic coast in North Africa and Europe. This herb presents seed dimorphism, producing large basal seeds with a mucilaginous coat that facilitates water absorption (more stress tolerant), and small apical seeds without coats (less stress tolerant). We analysed variation among populations in number, size and mucilage production of basal and apical seeds, and searched for relationships between local environment and plant size. Populations under higher stress (higher temperature, lower precipitation, lower soil organic matter) had fewer seeds per fruit, higher predominance of basal relative to apical seeds, and larger basal seeds with thicker mucilaginous coats. These results strongly suggest a trade-off between tolerance and fecundity at the fruit level underpins variation in seed traits among P. coronopus populations. However, seed production per plant showed the opposite pattern to seed production per fruit, and seemed related to plant size and other life-cycle components, as an additional strategy to cope with environmental variation across the range. The tolerance-fecundity model may constitute, under stress gradients, a broader ecological framework to explain trait variation than the classical seed size-number compromise, although several fecundity levels and traits should be considered to understand the diverse strategies of widespread plants to maximise fitness in each set of local conditions.",10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00684.x,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,1,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = seed number, size, miclage production ",

We analyzed the seasonal pattern of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of different crustacean zooplankton taxa to determine food sources, preferred habitats, and trophic positions of species throughout one year. The cladocerans Daphnia longispina galeata gr., Diaphanosoma brachyurum, and Eubosmina longispina were grouped into a primary consumer functional group from their delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures, but while the former two species shared the same food sources, the latter exhibited a more selective feeding strategy. Cyclopoid copepods occupied a distinct functional group from the other secondary consumers, being the most N-15 enriched group in the lake. The delta N-15 signature of calanoid copepods showed trophic enrichment in comparison to Daphnia and Eubosmina and linear mixing model results confirmed a predator-prey relationship.

Here, we have built an integrated model which is able to link climate, physical features of territory and inter-specific competition at aiming to simulate potential distribution of eight plant species (Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens, Fraxinus ornus, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer campestre, Acer obtusatum, Ostrya carpinifolia and Carpinus betulus) either at actual climate conditions or future ones (B1 and A2 climatic scenarios; IPCC, 2013). The integrated model is based on innovative methodological approach, which combined statistical tools (Principal Component Analyses and Discretization) and two-dimensional grid based model to consider the interactive effects of climate and inter-specific competition on plant species distribution. The study case was given by geographical spatialisation of the I.V. for each considered plant species, in the overall Italian territory. The simulations had always occurred by taking into consideration both expected climate change and inter-specific competition under highly complexity terrains. The results substantially differed from other studies that used only environmental predictors for estimating potential plant distributions. Variations in the I.V. distribution seemed to be due to variations of relative competitive abilities of plants, reducing both local extinctions of some species in Southern and Central Italy and migration toward North. Furthermore, our simulations suggested that under pressure of climate change the competitive ability of plant species will be likely affected by reducing the effects of competitive asymmetry.

(Am. Nat. 132, 404-416, 1988), but not without controversy. We re-evaluate some of the conclusions of this paper and the controversial discussions that followed. Problems with the quality and the interpretation of the data, some of which have been identified by previous authors, are seen in two main areas. First, the historical (phylogenetic) analysis relied on the use of a traditional (''Linnean'') classification of the genus Cicindela to infer relationships among taxa. This is insufficient to study transformation of characters involved in defensive strategies such as benzaldehyde production, habitat type, and body coloration. Also, it precludes any studies of covariation and association among these characters during the evolution of Cicindela. Second, the types of ecological data that have been used to make inferences about the evolution of defensive strategies are problematic. In particular, the use of ''habitat type'' may not be appropriate because the various character states have not been specified in the context of predation, and because the habitat type is of questionable relevance to other traits involved in predator defense and escape. We also question previous approaches which used Pearson et al.'s (1988) data to construe chemical defenses as adaptations to particular environmental conditions. We argue that the first problem can be overcome with specific knowledge of phylogenetic relationships of the taxa under study, while resolution of the second problem requires identifying characters that are more relevant to the selective regime experienced by tiger beetles. We conclude that integrating ecological and phylogenetic data in cicindelid and carabid studies will yield stronger evidence for the patterns and processes underlying character change in these groups.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Vogler, AP; Kelley, KC",1998,Covariation of defensive traits in tiger beetles (genus Cicindela): A phylogenetic approach using mtDNA,EVOLUTION,"Inferences about the evolution of defensive strategies in tiger beetles (genus Cicindela) have been contentious largely due to the lack of a phylogenetic hypothesis for the group. We used a dataset that includes measures of chemical defense, habitat association, and body coloration for a representative sample of North American Cicindela (Pearson et al. 1988) to reassess, within a phylogenetic context, the problem of covariation in defensive strategies. We reconstructed a phylogenetic hypothesis from mtDNA for a total of 44 Cicindela and seven outgroup taxa using 1896 base pairs from three segments of the mitochondrial genome. Characters involved in predator deterrence and escape were optimized onto this phylogeny. Although most taxa producing large amounts of benzaldehyde fall into two monophyletic clades, numerous changes in the level of benzaldehyde secretion across the genus suggest that this parameter is poorly conserved phylogenetically. In contrast to previous studies, we also found little support for correlated character changes in benzaldehyde secretion and habitat type, a presumed indicator of the selective regime. Aposematic coloration of the abdomen was restricted to a single monophyletic group of taxa producing large amounts of benzaldehyde. Bright iridescent coloration, implicated in predator evasion during flight, was only loosely correlated with the phylogenetic affinities of taxa and appears to be part of a defensive strategy not usually acting in combination with chemical defenses. Our study of character covariation clarifies earlier analyses of the adaptive significance of benzaldehyde defense, which were inconclusive without a phylogenetic hypothesis.",10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb01652.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,no env filtering,

We used the variation of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in 643 segments of whiskers as a temporal record of past diets and established isotopic dietary niches for 36 adult leopards (18 males, 18 females). Based on a variance analysis for stable carbon isotope ratios, we found that between-individual variation was larger than within-individual variation, indicating a high degree of overall specialization within the studied leopards. Female adult leopards exhibited larger isotopic dietary niche widths than male adult leopards. Isotopic niche width did not vary with body mass, body length or age.

"Voss, RS; Fleck, DW",2011,MAMMALIAN DIVERSITY AND MATSES ETHNOMAMMALOGY IN AMAZONIAN PERU PART 1: PRIMATES,BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,"This report is the first installment of a monographic study of mammalian diversity and ethnomammalogy in a sparsely inhabited rainforest region between the Yavari and Ucayali rivers in northeastern Peru. Our study is based on several large collections of mammals (totaling about 3500 specimens) made at various localities in this region between 1926 and 2003, and on our long-term ethnobiological and linguistic fieldwork with the Matses, a Panoan-speaking group of indigenous Amazonians who still obtain most of their dietary protein by hunting mammals. Our primary objectives are to document the species richness of the regional fauna through taxonomic analysis of collected specimens, and to assess the detail and accuracy of Matses knowledge of mammalian natural history by linguistic analysis of recorded interviews. The regional primate fauna is definitely known to consist of at least 14 species documented by collected specimens and/or repeated sightings of taxa with visually conspicuous diagnostic traits. This fauna includes three atelids (Alouatta seniculus, Ate/es belzebuth, Lagothrix lagothricha), eight cebids (Aotus nancymaae, Callimico goeldii, callithrix pygmaea, Cebus albifrons, Cebus Saguinus Saguinus mystax, Saimiri sciureus), and three pitheciids (Cacajao calms, Callicebus cupreus, Pithecia monachus). All 14 species are known to occur sympatrically at one inventory site, but Goeldi's monkey (Callimico goeldii) is rare and uakaris (Cacajao calms) seem to be patchily distributed, so some local faunas may have only 12 or even fewer species. This regional fauna is unique because neighboring interfluvial regions lack some species that are present in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve, and because some species that are present in neighboring interfluvial regions are not known to occur between the Yavari and the Ucayali. Matses knowledge about primate natural history is clearly correlated with size and cultural importance. For example, information obtained from standardized interviews about spicier monkeys (Ate/es belzebuth, a large game species) can be parsed into 86 observations about its ecology and/or behavior, whereas interviews about pygmy marmosets (Callithrix pygmaea, a small nongame species) contain only nine observations on these topics. Item-by-item comparisons of Matses observations about spider monkeys with the published results of scientific field research suggests that the Matses are generally accurate observers of primate natural history, a conclusion that is additionally supported by comparing community patterns of resource use compiled from our interview data with community-ecological studies of primate faunas in the scientific literature. Most exceptions (discrepancies between Matses observations and the scientific literature) can be explained by cultural inattention to small nongame species. Although these results suggest that archiving native Amazonian knowledge about mammalian natural history might be a cost-effective alternative to lengthy fieldwork for some research objectives, there are significant linguistic barriers than can inhibit effective cross-cultural communication. Among the Matses, these include a surprisingly large number of zoologically redundant names (synonyms and hyponyms). Relevant primate examples are discussed in substantive detail.",NA,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

To date, there have been no analyses of how extensively community ecology theory appears in the empirical restoration literature. 2. We address this knowledge gap with the first quantitative assessment of the extent to which community ecology concepts appear in empirical restoration literature by analysing the use of community ecology theories, concepts and conceptually derived tools in the design and interpretation of 1,000+ experimental ecological restoration studies over time (20 years) across all global regions. We also gauge general trends in author demographics, focal ecosystems and taxa targeted by these studies. 3.

"Wake, DB",2006,Problems with species: Patterns and processes of species formation in salamanders,ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN,"How many species one recognizes within a given taxon remains a difficult question, especially when morphology is relatively stable or when clinal variation is present, thus complicating diagnosis. I accept the general lineage concept of species, and my goal is to recognize historically distinct evolutionary lineages that are likely to remain distinct. Here I analyze this task with respect to patterns of species formation in two genera of plethodontid salamanders in California. Ensatina is a ring species complex surrounding the Central Valley of California. At present it is a single species with seven subspecies that are linked by apparent clinal variation in intergrade zones, but there are also some narrow hybrid zones where morphologically and ecologically differentiated forms interact. In contrast, Batrachoseps, which has much the same distribution, has about 20 species in California, most occurring in sympatry with Ensatina. Divergence in the two taxa is based on two fundamentally different phenomena, and yet there are some common themes. Adaptive divergence in coloration is the dominant theme in Ensatina, whereas differentiation is largely perceived at the molecular level in Batrachoseps. Yet both have evolved in the same region and have been affected by many of the same climatic and earth historical phenomena. Within the Ensatina complex, different adaptations related to predator avoidance have evolved. Coloration has diverged in different directions in coastal and inland populations, even though genetic interactions continue to take place. Where coastal populations meet other coastal populations, ecologically and morphologically similar populations merge genetically, even if well differentiated in molecular traits. In contrast, where the ring is crossed and where ecologically and morphologically differentiated populations meet, they hybridize narrowly or are sympatric and behave as if they are species. Within the ring-like distribution, clinal patterns of variation occur. The current polytypic taxonomy is retained, even though it is problematic, because alternatives are even less appropriate. In contrast, where genetically differentiated populations of Batrachoseps meet they typically do not merge. Instead, they replace one another spatially, in part because they are so similar ecologically.

"Walker, SC",2015,Indirect gradient analysis by Markov-chain Monte Carlo,PLANT ECOLOGY,"Classical gradient analysis continues to be used to explore and test theories and models in community ecology. Yet the foundations of classical gradient analysis were developed at a time when computational power was limited, relative to current computational power. I argue that this history has left a lasting legacy on the field. Consequently, many gradient analyses do not to take advantage of current computer technology. Here I show how to use computationally intensive Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods to improve gradient analyses of presence-absence community data. The methods that I use were developed by quantitative social scientists in the early 1990s, and therefore tested and efficient software already exists for practical data analysis. As an example, I analyze the classic dune meadow vegetation data. A main advantage of the Bayesian approach to indirect gradient analysis is that, unlike essentially all classical indirect methods, it is able to make empirically testable probabilistic predictions of observed species occurrence patterns. The Bayesian approach also poses challenges for statistical ecology. In particular, the development of Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods for a wider class of Bayesian indirect gradient analysis models would permit more flexible approaches to generating probabilistic predictions.",10.1007/s11258-015-0467-7,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The Mechanics of Mandibular Symphysis Proportions in Crocodiles,PLOS ONE,"Background: Crocodilians exhibit a spectrum of rostral shape from long snouted (longirostrine), through to short snouted (brevirostrine) morphologies. The proportional length of the mandibular symphysis correlates consistently with rostral shape, forming as much as 50% of the mandible's length in longirostrine forms, but 10% in brevirostrine crocodilians. Here we analyse the structural consequences of an elongate mandibular symphysis in relation to feeding behaviours.Methods/Principal Findings: Simple beam and high resolution Finite Element (FE) models of seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads simulating biting, shaking and twisting. Using beam theory, we statistically compared multiple hypotheses of which morphological variables should control the biomechanical response. Brevi- and mesorostrine morphologies were found to consistently outperform longirostrine types when subject to equivalent biting, shaking and twisting loads. The best predictors of performance for biting and twisting loads in FE models were overall length and symphyseal length respectively; for shaking loads symphyseal length and a multivariate measurement of shape (PC1 - which is strongly but not exclusively correlated with symphyseal length) were equally good predictors. Linear measurements were better predictors than multivariate measurements of shape in biting and twisting loads. For both biting and shaking loads but not for twisting, simple beam models agree with best performance predictors in FE models.Conclusions/Significance: Combining beam and FE modelling allows a priori hypotheses about the importance of morphological traits on biomechanics to be statistically tested. Short mandibular symphyses perform well under loads used for feeding upon large prey, but elongate symphyses incur high strains under equivalent loads, underlining the structural constraints to prey size in the longirostrine morphotype. The biomechanics of the crocodilian mandible are largely consistent with beam theory and can be predicted from simple morphological measurements, suggesting that crocodilians are a useful model for investigating the palaeobiomechanics of other aquatic tetrapods.",10.1371/journal.pone.0053873,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Broad,Herps,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,,traits = a bunch of morphological ones about the head/rostrum,

Theory predicts that predictable environmental variation selects for both increased within-and across-generation responses. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical tests of this prediction. We explored the relationship between within-versus across-generation plasticity by evaluating the influence of predator cues on the life-history traits of Daphnia ambigua. We measured the duration of predator-induced transgenerational effects, determined when transgenerational responses are induced, and quantified the cues that activate transgenerational plasticity. We show that predator exposure during embryonic development causes earlier maturation and increased reproductive output. Such effects are detectable two generations removed from predator exposure and are similar in magnitude in response to exposure to cues emitted by injured conspecifics. Moreover, all experimental contexts and traits yielded a negative correlation between within-versus across-generation responses. That is, responses to predator cues within- and across-generations were opposite in sign and magnitude. Although many models address transgenerational plasticity, none of them explain this apparent negative relationship between within- and across-generation plasticities.

I sampled the aquatic insect community in control and treatment reaches before and during the 3-mo water diversions.

This derivation explicitly represents two key biotic factors, food supply (I) and predator abundance (R), which appear as a risk ratio (R/I) that facilitates modelling of changes in trophic circumstances and analysis of historical data. The same general recruitment relationship is expected whether the juvenile life history is simple or involves a complex sequence of stanzas; in the complex case, the Beverton-Holt parameters represent weighted averages or integrals of risk ratios over the stanzas. The relationship should also apply in settings where there is complex, mesoscale variation in habitat and predation risk, provided that animals sense this variation and move about so as to achieve similar survival at all mesoscale rearing sites. The model predicts that changes in food and predation risk can be amplified violently in settings where juvenile survival rate is low, producing large changes in recruitment rates over time.",10.1023/A:1008991021305,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Broad,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,0,0,0,,,1,Single,0,0,0,0,1,,traits  = survival rate,

Here, we aimed to assess the generality of the SDH using both leaf and absorptive root traits and phylogenetic diversity at a large scale.MethodsWe examined the changes in the trait and phylogenetic diversity of six leaf and absorptive root traits along a soil fertility gradient from tropical to boreal forests. Trait and phylogenetic convergence and divergence were tested by the null model approach.ResultsLeaf economic traits (i.e. specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration) and root tissue density (RTD) exhibited a coordinated response to soil fertility gradient, shifting from convergence toward species with conservative leaf traits and low RTD under infertile condition to high trait divergence under fertile soil. Similarly, community phylogenetic structure varied from convergence to divergence along the soil fertility gradient. However, variation in other traits was not consistent with the SDH prediction.ConclusionsThe SDH depends on the trait's ecological role, and RTD is the most consistent root trait with leaf economic traits that reflect community assembly along soil fertility gradient.

"Wang, X; Fan, M; Hao, L",2016,Adaptive evolution of foraging-related trait in intraguild predation system,MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES,"This paper considers a tri-trophic food chain in which the top predator (intraguild predator) also feeds on the basal resource. We refer to the model as intraguild predation. We analyze its dynamics from an evolutionary perspective. The attack rate or foraging effort of the middle species (intraguild prey) for the basal resources is assumed to be evolvable and is also assumed to be traded off with the vulnerability to being attacked by the top predator: We focus on the analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of the attack rate using the adaptive dynamics approximation of mutation limited evolution. In particular, the critical function analysis is applied. This study reveals that the evolutionary dynamics of the intraguild predation system is completely characterized by the concavity of the trade-off function and admits trichotomous dynamic scenarios: (1) when the trade-off function is more concave than the critical function, an evolutionary singular strategy exists and is a repeller; (2) when the trade-off function is less concave than the critical function, the evolutionary singular strategy is convergence stable and turns into an evolutionary branching point, in which case the monomorphic intraguild prey will split into two different types; (3) when the trade-off function is convex, the evolutionary singular strategy turns into a continuous stable strategy and is uninvadable. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the adaptive foraging behavior may strongly influence the community stability. Consequently, it may promote the diversity of intraguild prey and the persistence of the system on the evolutionary timescale, which highlight a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the intricate interplay between ecological and evolutionary force. This modeling approach provides a venue for research on indirect effects from an evolutionary perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Until recently, few studies have examined the spatial variation of PD and FD in natural communities. Yet the relationships between PD and FD and area (termed PDAR and FDAR), like the analogous species-area relationship (SAR), have received less attention and may provide insights into the mechanisms that shape the composition and dynamics of ecological communities. In this study, we used four spatial point process models to evaluate the likely roles of the random placement of species, habitat filtering, dispersal limitation, and the combined effects of habitat filtering and dispersal limitation in producing observed PDARs and FDARs in two large, fully mapped temperate forest research plots in northeast China and in north-central USA. We found that the dispersal limitation hypothesis provided a good approximation of the accumulation of PD and FD with increasing area, as it did for the species area curves. PDAR and FDAR patterns were highly correlated with the SAR. We interpret this as evidence that species interactions, which are often influenced by phylogenetic and functional similarity, may be relatively unimportant in structuring temperate forest tree assemblages at this scale. However, the scale-dependent departures of the PDAR and FDAR that emerged for the dispersal limitation hypothesis agree with operation of competitive exclusion at small scales and habitat filtering at larger scales.

Stochastic dilution is a consequence of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity where the identities of the nearest neighbors of individuals of a given species are largely unpredictable. Under such circumstances, the outcome of deterministic species interactions may vary greatly among individuals of a given species. Consequently, nonrandom patterns in the biotic neighborhoods of species, which might be expected from coexistence or community assembly theory (e.g., individuals of a given species are neighbored by phylogenetically similar species), are weakened or do not emerge, resulting in statistical independence of species spatial distributions. We used data on phylogenetic and functional similarity of tree species in five large forest dynamics plots located across a gradient of species richness to test predictions of the stochastic dilution hypothesis. To quantify the biotic neighborhood of a focal species we used the mean phylogenetic (or functional) dissimilarity of the individuals of the focal species to all species within a local neighborhood. We then compared the biotic neighborhood of species to predictions from stochastic null models to test if a focal species was surrounded by more or less similar species than expected by chance. The proportions of focal species that showed spatial independence with respect to their biotic neighborhoods increased with total species richness. Locally dominant, high-abundance species were more likely to be surrounded by species that were statistically more similar or more dissimilar than expected by chance. Our results suggest that stochasticity may play a stronger role in shaping the spatial structure of species rich tropical forest communities than it does in species poorer forests. These findings represent an important step towards understanding the factors that govern the spatial configuration of local biotic communities. The stochastic dilution effect is a simple geometric mechanism that can explain why species' spatial distributions in species-rich communities approximate independence from their biotic neighborhood, even if deterministic niche processes are in effect.",10.1890/14-2357.1,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Temperate Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = maximum height, leaf area, specific leaf area, wood density, leaf nitrogen, and leaf phosphorus",

Investigations of functional beta diversity, on the other hand, have not been conducted at local scales in a spatially explicit way. In this study, we provide a powerful methodology based on recent advances in spatial point pattern analysis using fully mapped data of large and small trees in two large temperate forest plots. This approach allowed us to assess the relative importance of different ecological processes and mechanisms for explaining patterns of local phylogenetic and functional beta diversity. For both forests and size classes, we found a clear hierarchy of scales: habitat filtering accounted for patterns of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity at larger distances (150-250 m), dispersal limitation accounted for the observed decline in beta diversity at distances below 150 m, and species interactions explained small departures from functional and phylogenetic beta diversity at the immediate plant-neighborhood scale (below 20 m). Thus, both habitat filtering and dispersal limitation influenced the observed patterns in phylogenetic and functional beta diversity at local scales. This result contrasts with a previous study from the same forests, where dispersal limitation alone approximated the observed species beta diversity for distances up to 250 m. In addition, species interactions were relatively unimportant for predicting phylogenetic and functional beta diversity.

"Wang, YP; Chen, SH; Ding, P",2011,"Testing multiple assembly rule models in avian communities on islands of an inundated lake, Zhejiang Province, China",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aim A fundamental question in community ecology is whether general assembly rules determine the structure of natural communities. Although many types of assembly rules have been described, including Diamond's assembly rules, constant body-size ratios, favoured states, and nestedness, few studies have tested multiple assembly rule models simultaneously. Therefore, little is known about the relative importance of potential underlying factors such as interspecific competition, inter-guild competition, selective extinction and habitat nestedness in structuring community composition. Here, we test the above four assembly rule models and examine the causal basis for the observed patterns using bird data collected on islands of an inundated lake. Location Thousand Island Lake, China. Methods We collected data on presence-absence matrices, body size and functional groups for bird assemblages on 42 islands from 2007 to 2009. To test the above four assembly rule models, we used null model analyses to compare observed species co-occurrence patterns, body-size distributions and functional group distributions with randomly generated assemblages. To ensure that the results were not biased by the inclusion of species with extremely different ecologies, we conducted separate analyses for the entire assemblage and for various subset matrices classified according to foraging guilds. Results The bird assemblages did not support predictions by several competitively structured assembly rule models, including Diamond's assembly rules, constant body-size ratios, and favoured states. In contrast, bird assemblages were highly significantly nested and were apparently shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness. The nestedness of bird assemblages was not a result of passive sampling or selective colonization. These results were very consistent, regardless of whether the entire assemblage or the subset matrices were analysed. Main conclusions Our results suggest that bird assemblages were shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness, rather than by interspecific or inter-guild competition.

However, links between an individual's positions on behavioral vs. ecological axes of variation remain relatively unstudied in the wild. In the course of fieldwork on a remote floodplain in tropical Australia, we quantified boldness and ecological traits in 86 free-ranging (radio-tracked) monitor lizards (Varanus panoptes). These large (up to 7 kg) lizards exhibited a spectrum of boldness, as reflected in correlated scores of responses to approach, handling, and novel prey. Bolder lizards had larger core home ranges and higher mating success and spent more time in areas of high predator abundance, and their seasonal regimes of predation-induced mortality differed from those of shyer lizards. Thus, behavioral differences among lizards underpin much of the variation in ecological traits and individual fitness within this population.

To investigate the relevant importance of these two mechanisms, a series of pot experiments were performed in which the competitive relationships of eight species of grass were estimated in monoculture, in pair-wise comparisons and by the impact of their removal on the remaining community. Although superficially above-ground biomass appeared to be a good predictor of competitive ability, more detailed analysis revealed that size was ineffective as a predictor of a species' impact on a community. In contrast there was evidence that complementarity was important in determining species-species interactions both at the level of pairs of species and even more so at community level.

Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example.

A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model.

In this paper, we build on recent equivalences between the maximum entropy formalism and Poisson regression to show that CATS is equivalent to a generalized linear model for abundance, with species traits as predictor variables. Main advantages gained by access to the machinery of generalized linear models can be summarized as advantages in interpretation, model checking, extensions and inference. A more difficult issue, however, is the development of valid methods of inference for single-site data, as species correlation in abundance is not accounted for in CATS (whether specified as a regression or via maximum entropy). This issue can be circumvented for multisite data using design-based inference. These points are illustrated by example - our plant abundances were found to violate the implicit Poisson assumption of CATS, but a negative binomial regression had much improved fit, and our model was extended to multisite data in order to directly model the environment-trait interaction. Violations of the Poisson assumption were strong and accounting for them qualitatively changed results, presumably because larger counts had undue influence when overdispersion had not been accounted for.

The Phoenicopteriformes (flamingos), Psittaciformes (parrots) and Procellariiformes (petrels and shearwaters) had the longest mean maximum life spans (> 30 years), and the Passeriformes (perching birds), Podicipediformes (grebes) and Piciformes (woodpeckers) had the shortest mean maximum life spans (< 10 years).

Male reproductive success did not vary significantly with body size, tail length, condition, home range size, or the number of microsatellite loci at which males were heterozygous, nor with other features of their genetic profiles. However, we found evidence of positive assortative mating by size in the marsh in which receptive females were not spatially clumped. Also, males that were most active during the mating season were more successful, particularly where females were not clumped. We failed to find evidence of selection acting on male size through variance in reproductive successs, indicating that sexual selection does not have an important influence on sexual size dimorphism in this species (males are smallere than females).

"Webber, QMR; Vander Wal, E",2018,An evolutionary framework outlining the integration of individual social and spatial ecology,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological environment, which could explain variation in fitness. 2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics. 3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment.",10.1111/1365-2656.12773,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Weber, MG; Keeler, KH",2013,The phylogenetic distribution of extrafloral nectaries in plants,ANNALS OF BOTANY,"Understanding the evolutionary patterns of ecologically relevant traits is a central goal in plant biology. However, for most important traits, we lack the comprehensive understanding of their taxonomic distribution needed to evaluate their evolutionary mode and tempo across the tree of life. Here we evaluate the broad phylogenetic patterns of a common plant-defence trait found across vascular plants: extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), plant glands that secrete nectar and are located outside the flower. EFNs typically defend plants indirectly by attracting invertebrate predators who reduce herbivory. Records of EFNs published over the last 135 years were compiled. After accounting for changes in taxonomy, phylogenetic comparative methods were used to evaluate patterns of EFN evolution, using a phylogeny of over 55 000 species of vascular plants. Using comparisons of parametric and non-parametric models, the true number of species with EFNs likely to exist beyond the current list was estimated. To date, EFNs have been reported in 3941 species representing 745 genera in 108 families, about 12 of vascular plant species and approx. 21 of families. They are found in 33 of 65 angiosperm orders. Foliar nectaries are known in four of 36 fern families. Extrafloral nectaries are unknown in early angiosperms, magnoliids and gymnosperms. They occur throughout monocotyledons, yet most EFNs are found within eudicots, with the bulk of species with EFNs being rosids. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support the repeated gain and loss of EFNs across plant clades, especially in more derived dicot families, and suggest that EFNs are found in a minimum of 457 independent lineages. However, model selection methods estimate that the number of unreported cases of EFNs may be as high as the number of species already reported. EFNs are widespread and evolutionarily labile traits that have repeatedly evolved a remarkable number of times in vascular plants. Our current understanding of the phylogenetic patterns of EFNs makes them powerful candidates for future work exploring the drivers of their evolutionary origins, shifts, and losses.",10.1093/aob/mcs225,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We then outline generalizable steps for integrating methods of phylogenetic and historical biogeographical analyses into studies of biotic assembly. ResultsWe present a framework that can be applied to any biotic assemblage amenable to phylogenetic and historical biogeographical analyses, can accommodate changes in spatial extent and temporal scale, and will facilitate comparison of assembly processes across biotas. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of an historical approach for providing context to ecological influences on evolutionary processes, such as trait evolution. Main conclusionsBy focusing on reconstructing the histories of individual lineages, an historical approach to assembly analysis can reveal the timing and underlying processes guiding biotic assembly, making it possible to disentangle the roles of history and ecology in the assembly process.",10.1111/jbi.12747,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

"Weiher, E; Clarke, GDP; Keddy, PA",1998,"Community assembly rules, morphological dispersion, and the coexistence of plant species",OIKOS,"In order to find and define any assembly rules for communities, we must first investigate the patterns among species assemblages. We used a series of null models to test for patterns in wetland plant composition al the level of species, functional guilds, and traits. At the species level, we found significant checkerboard and nestedness patterns. Three functional guilds had some tendency to contribute a constant percentage to species richness, but after Bonferroni correction there was no significant pattern. Coexisting plant species showed no consistent overall pattern of morphological dispersion. However, when we considered each of 11 traits in turn, we found that 4 traits were overdispersed and 3 were underdispersed. Thus there are morphological assembly rules that constrain wetland plant community composition. These results reconcile contrasting views of community assembly. Communities can be simultaneously structured by a tension between two forces: abiotic external forces that constrain certain traits within limits and biotic internal forces that tend to keep coexisting species from being too similar. Because our sites vary along a fertility/disturbance gradient, we also investigated how trait dispersion varies in space. Trait dispersion increases with soil Fertility; soil phosphorus explains about 36% of the variance in mean nearest neighbor distance.

A PATH-ANALYSIS OF THE ECOLOGICAL FACTORS BEHIND SELECTION,EVOLUTION,"We examined phenotypic selection exerted by natural enemies on the gall-making fly Eurosta solidaginis in an extensive field study of 16 populations, spanning four generations. Gall-makers that induce small galls are vulnerable to the attack of Eurytoma gigantea. This imposes upward directional selection on gall size. Insectivorous birds, predominantly the downy woodpecker, are more likely to attack larvae that induce large galls than small ones, and this imposes downward directional selection. We used path analysis to explore the relative contributions of these natural enemies to the net directional selection on gall size. The path models further examined several ecological factors that influence selection intensity through their effects on parasitoid and bird attack rates. Net directional selection varied more strongly with E. gigantea attack than bird attack. Competitive interactions among birds and the three parasitoid species, including E. gigantea, were evidenced by low winter bird attack rates in fields where a high proportion of galls contained the overwintering parasitoids. Eurytoma gigantea attack was heavier in fields where mean gall size was small and bird attack heavier in fields where mean gall size was large. Neither birds nor E. gigantea showed simple density-dependent attack.

The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research.First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the 'main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity-stability theory.Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness.Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above-than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances.Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle.Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above-and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions.Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes.Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse 'High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services.A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort ( in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments.To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Although the nature of the pelagic habitat and the main phytoplankton taxa and ecology are relatively similar in both marine and freshwater systems, the lines of research have evolved, at least in part, separately. We compare and contrast the approaches adopted in marine and freshwater ecosystems with respect to phytoplankton functional traits. We note differences in study goals relating to functional trait use that assess community assembly and those that relate to ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycling that affect the type of characteristics assigned as traits to phytoplankton taxa. Specific phytoplankton traits relevant for ecological function are examined in relation to herbivory, amplitude of environmental change and spatial and temporal scales of study. Major differences are identified, including the shorter time scale for regular environmental change in freshwater ecosystems compared to that in the open oceans as well as the type of sampling done by researchers based on site-accessibility. Overall, we encourage researchers to better motivate why they apply trait-based analyses to their studies and to make use of process-driven approaches, which are more common in marine studies. We further propose fully comparative trait studies conducted along the habitat gradient spanning freshwater to brackish to marine systems, or along geographic gradients.

"Weithoff, G; Rocha, MR; Gaedke, U",2015,Comparing seasonal dynamics of functional and taxonomic diversity reveals the driving forces underlying phytoplankton community structure,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"In most biodiversity studies, taxonomic diversity is the measure for the multiplicity of species and is often considered to represent functional diversity. However, trends in taxonomic diversity and functional diversity may differ, for example, when many functionally similar but taxonomically different species co-occur in a community. The differences between these diversity measures are of particular interest in diversity research for understanding diversity patterns and their underlying mechanisms. We analysed a temporally highly resolved 20-year time series of lake phytoplankton to determine whether taxonomic diversity and functional diversity exhibit similar or contrasting seasonal patterns. We also calculated the functional mean of the community in n-dimensional trait space for each sampling day to gain further insights into the seasonal dynamics of the functional properties of the community. We found an overall weak positive relationship between taxonomic diversity and functional diversity with a distinct seasonal pattern. The two diversity measures showed synchronous behaviour from early spring to mid-summer and a more complex and diverging relationship from autumn to late winter. The functional mean of the community exhibited a recurrent annual pattern with the most prominent changes before and after the clear-water phase. From late autumn to winter, the functional mean of the community and functional diversity were relatively constant while taxonomic diversity declined, suggesting competitive exclusion during this period. A further decline in taxonomic diversity concomitant with increasing functional diversity in late winter to early spring is seen as a result of niche diversification together with competitive exclusion. Under these conditions, several different sets of traits are suitable to thrive, but within one set of functional traits only one, or very few, morphotypes can persist. Taxonomic diversity alone is a weak descriptor of trait diversity in phytoplankton. However, the combined analysis of taxonomic diversity and functional diversity, along with the functional mean of the community, allows for deeper insights into temporal patterns of community assembly and niche diversification.",10.1111/fwb.12527,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Plankton,Lake,1,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = size, shape, phagotrophy, motility, demand for silica, ",
"WELLBORN, GA",1994,SIZE-BIASED PREDATION AND PREY LIFE-HISTORIES - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF FRESH-WATER AMPHIPOD POPULATIONS,ECOLOGY,"A prior survey of Michigan populations of a freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca, indicated that populations occur as one of two morphotypes that differ in body size and life history traits. Population types, which may represent separate species, are associated with distinct habitat types. Generally, lakes with centrarchid fish contain a small-bodied form, and fishless ponds and marshes contain a large-bodied form. In this comparative study of two Hyalella populations, I examine the potential role of size-biased feeding by major predators in maintaining, and perhaps generating, the pattern of association between Hyalella morphotype and habitat type. In Duck Lake (centrarchid fish present), overall mortality generally increased with body size in each of two study years, and adult mortality exceeded juvenile mortality. The opposite pattern was observed in a nearby fishless habitat, Duck Marsh, where mortality generally declined with size, so that juvenile mortality exceeded adult mortality. To determine the degree to which size-biased predation might cause the observed mortality patterns, I used stomach content analysis to assess prey size preferences of fish in the lake habitat and laboratory foraging trials to examine size-biased predation by invertebrate predators from the marsh. Fish predators displayed a strong tendency to prey on larger, adult Hyalella. Size preferences exhibited by larval dragonflies, the principal invertebrate predators in the marsh habitat, depended on predator body size, with small larvae preferring juvenile Hyalella and the largest larvae preferring adults. In general, size-selective predation by major predators in each habitat appeared to contribute importantly to overall mortality patterns, the exception being the marsh habitat in a year of low predator density.Observed differences in life history traits between populations are in close agreement with predictions derived from life history models addressing the influence of size-biased mortality on the evolution of reproductive allocation, size at maturity, and egg size. Life history characteristics of Hyalella were measured both on field-collected individuals and on individuals reared for approximately two generations in replicated predator-free artificial ponds. In field samples, the lake Hyalella population exhibited a smaller mean adult body size, smaller size at maturity, smaller egg size, and higher size-specific fecundity and reproductive investment than the marsh population. These life history differences were also observed in the artificial pond experiment, indicating that these traits are genetically based and nonplastic.",10.2307/1941614,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Other,Lake,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = size at maturity, egg size",

However, mostly mutualistic and antagonistic interactions of living organisms have been studied, whereas detritivore networks and their successional changes are largely unexplored. We studied the interactions of saproxylic (deadwood-dependent) beetles with their dead host trees. In a large-scale experiment, 764 logs of 13 tree species were exposed to analyse network structure of three trophic groups of saproxylic beetles over 3 successional years. We found remarkably high specialization of deadwood-feeding xylophages and lower specialization of fungivorous and predatory species. During deadwood succession, community composition, network specialization and network robustness changed differently for the functional groups. To reveal potential drivers of network specialization, we linked species' functional traits to their network roles, and tested for trait matching between plant (i.e. chemical compounds) and beetle (i.e. body size) traits. We found that both plant and animal traits are major drivers of species specialization, and that trait matching can be more important in explaining interactions than neutral processes reflecting species abundance distributions. High network specialization in the early successional stage and decreasing network robustness during succession indicate vulnerability of detritivore networks to reduced tree species diversity and beetle extinctions, with unknown consequences for wood decomposition and nutrient cycling.",10.1098/rspb.2017.0198,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Weng, Ensheng; Farrior, Caroline E.; Dybzinski, Ray; Pacala, Stephen W.",2017,Predicting vegetation type through physiological and environmental interactions with leaf traits: evergreen and deciduous forests in an earth system modeling framework,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Earth system models are incorporating plant trait diversity into their land components to better predict vegetation dynamics in a changing climate. However, extant plant trait distributions will not allow extrapolations to novel community assemblages in future climates, which will require a mechanistic understanding of the trade-offs that determine trait diversity. In this study, we show how physiological trade-offs involving leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf lifespan, leaf nitrogen, and leaf respiration may explain the distribution patterns of evergreen and deciduous trees in the temperate and boreal zones based on (1) an evolutionary analysis of a simple mathematical model and (2) simulation experiments of an individual-based dynamic vegetation model (i.e., LM3-PPA). The evolutionary analysis shows that these leaf traits set up a trade-off between carbon-and nitrogen-use efficiency at the scale of individual trees and therefore determine competitively dominant leaf strategies. As soil nitrogen availability increases, the dominant leaf strategy switches from one that is high in nitrogen-use efficiency to one that is high in carbon-use efficiency or, equivalently, from high-LMA/long-lived leaves (i.e., evergreen) to low-LMA/short-lived leaves (i.e., deciduous). In a region of intermediate soil nitrogen availability, the dominant leaf strategy may be either deciduous or evergreen depending on the initial conditions of plant trait abundance (i.e., founder controlled) due to feedbacks of leaf traits on soil nitrogen mineralization through litter quality. Simulated successional patterns by LM3-PPA from the leaf physiological trade-offs are consistent with observed successional dynamics of evergreen and deciduous forests at three sites spanning the temperate to boreal zones.",10.1111/gcb.13542,Y,0,0,0,0,0,1,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Broad,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"traits = leaf mass/unit area, leaf lifespan, leaf N, leaf respiration",

The best known classification is based on Curtis' continuum index (CI), calculated using the presence of indicator species thought centered on different portions of an underlying moisture gradient. Direct evidence of the extent to which CI reflects differences in moisture availability has been lacking, however. Many factors that increase moisture availability (e.g., soil depth, silt content) also increase nutrient supply and decrease soil mechanical impedance; the ecological effects of the last have rarely been considered in any ecosystem. Decreased soil mechanical impedance should increase the availability of soil moisture and nutrients by reducing the root costs of retrieving both. Here we assess the relative importance of soil moisture, nutrient supply, and mechanical impedance in determining prairie composition and structure. We used leaf delta C-13 of C-3 plants as a measure of growing-season moisture availability, cation exchange capacity (CEC) x soil depth as a measure of mineral nutrient availability, and penetrometer data as a measure of soil mechanical impedance. Community composition and structure were assessed in 17 remnant prairies in Wisconsin which vary little in annual precipitation. Ordination and regression analyses showed that delta C-13 increased with CI toward ""drier"" sites, and decreased with soil depth and% silt content. Variation in delta C-13 among remnants was 2.0 parts per thousand, comparable to that along continental gradients from ca. 500-1500 mm annual rainfall. As predicted, LAI and average leaf height increased significantly toward ""wetter"" sites. CI accounted for 54% of compositional variance but delta C-13 accounted for only 6.2%, despite the strong relationships of delta C-13 to CI and CI to composition.

Behavioral ecology aims to elucidate mechanisms of organisms' response to their environment, but often lacks the context of natural conditions and the surrounding landscape or riverscape. Bringing together the relative strengths of these two fields-context in the case of riverscapes and mechanism in the case of behavioral ecology-can provide fisheries managers and conservation biologists with improved predictions of fish response to anthropogenic impacts such as habitat degradation, landscape fragmentation, and climate change. Existing research on fish behavior incorporating a riverscape perspective includes the study of fishmigration and dispersal, habitat selection, and reproduction and life history strategies. The merging of these disciplines is termed 'behaviorscapes' and a program of research would adhere to four principles: (1) study fish populations or communities in a natural setting, (2) account for landscape and riverscape context, (3) incorporate a refined understanding of fish behavior, and (4) forge linkages between individual behavior and population or community demographics. Several potential directions for future research exist, including developing or improving technologies to map internal heterogeneity of rivers; making explicit links between that heterogeneity and fish behavior through observations or experiments; and employing an iterative approach to using ecological knowledge, a priori hypotheses, and precise spatial analysis to bridge the pattern-process divide.

We estimated plant community phylogeny from rbcL gene sequences to quantify change in phylogenetic structure during succession. Mean phylogenetic distance among co-occurring trees increased with total basal area per plot, a proxy for forest age. Significant phylogenetic clustering was detected in secondary forest whereas primary forest was significantly over-dispersed relative to null expectations. We examined the sensitivity of these patterns to various methods of branch length estimation and phylogenetic uncertainty. Power to detect community phylogenetic patterns when equal branch lengths were assumed was weak in comparison to direct molecular and time-calibrated measures of divergence. Inferred change during forest succession was also robust to phylogenetic uncertainty so long as temporal information was incorporated in estimates of divergence.

"Whitney, James E.; Whittier, Joanna B.; Paukert, Craig P.; Olden, Julian D.; Strecker, Angela L.",2017,Forecasted range shifts of arid-land fishes in response to climate change,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,"Climate change is poised to alter the distributional limits, center, and size of many species. Traits may influence different aspects of range shifts, with trophic generality facilitating shifts at the leading edge, and greater thermal tolerance limiting contractions at the trailing edge. The generality of relationships between traits and range shifts remains ambiguous however, especially for imperiled fishes residing in xeric riverscapes. Our objectives were to quantify contemporary fish distributions in the Lower Colorado River Basin, forecast climate change by 2085 using two general circulation models, and quantify shifts in the limits, center, and size of fish elevational ranges according to fish traits. We examined relationships among traits and range shift metrics either singly using univariate linear modeling or combined with multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that trophic and dispersal traits were associated with shifts at the leading and trailing edges, respectively, although projected range shifts were largely unexplained by traits. As expected, piscivores and omnivores with broader diets shifted upslope most at the leading edge while more specialized invertivores exhibited minimal changes. Fishes that were more mobile shifted upslope most at the trailing edge, defying predictions. No traits explained changes in range center or size. Finally, current preference explained multivariate range shifts, as fishes with faster current preferences exhibited smaller multivariate changes. Although range shifts were largely unexplained by traits, more specialized invertivorous fishes with lower dispersal propensity or greater current preference may require the greatest conservation efforts because of their limited capacity to shift ranges under climate change.",10.1007/s11160-017-9479-9,Y,0,1,0,0,0,1,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,River,1,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,1,0,,,0,Multiple,1,Climate Change,0,0,1,1,"trait = IUCN listing,thermal perference, critical thermal maximum, spawning temperature, fluvial dependence, current preference, max body length, shape factor, swim factor, trophic guild, diet breadth, fecundiyt, reproductive guild.

Species have traits that allow them to respond to their environment. Our current knowledge on environment to species traits relationships is limited in spite of its potential importance for understanding community assembly and ecosystem function. The aim of our study was to examine the relative roles of environmental and spatial variables for the small-scale variation in Collembola (springtail) communities in a Dutch salt marsh. We used a trait-based approach in combination with spatial statistics and variance partitioning, between environmental and spatial variables, to examine the important ecological factors that drive community composition. Turnover of trait diversity across space was lower than for species diversity. Most of the variation in community composition was explained by small-scale spatial variation in topography, on a scale of 4-6 m, most likely because it determines the effect of inundation, which restricts where habitat generalists can persist. There were only small pure spatial effects on species and trait diversity, indicating that biotic interactions or dispersal limitation probably were less important for structuring the community at this scale. Our results suggest that for springtails, life form (i.e. whether they live in the soil or litter or on the surface/in vegetation) is an important and useful trait to understand community assembly. Hence, using traits in addition to species identity when analysing environment-organism relationships results in a better understanding of the factors affecting community composition.",10.1007/s00442-015-3345-z,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Other,Salt Marsh,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body length, antennal to body length ratio, life form, moisture preference, habitat width",

While there is evidence for these relationships across global data sets, they are often too broad in scale and do not consider the particularities of local to regional species pools. This decreases their usefulness for developing predictive models at scales relevant for conservation and management. We tested for trade-offs between traits and relationships with environmental gradients in trees and shrubs sampled across southern African savannas and explored evidence for acquisitive versus conservative resource-use strategies using a phylogenetically explicit approach. We found a distinct trade-off between two major poles of specialization indicative of acquisitive (high leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf N:P, specific leaf area and average leaf area) and conservative resource-use strategies (high leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), tensile strength and leaf dry matter content). Although we found that trait variance and species occurrence were constrained by phylogeny, phylogenetically informed analyses did not contradict non-phylogenetic analyses, strengthening relationships in most cases. The high intrasite trait variability and weak relationships with soils and climate may in part be explained by the high levels of deciduousness and disturbance (i.e. fire and herbivory) inherent in African savannas.Synthesis.

However, explaining the evolution of complex traits such as body size is difficult because a plethora of other traits influence body size. Here I review what we know about the evolution of body size in a group of island reptiles and try to generalize about the mechanisms that shape body size. Galapagos marine iguanas occupy all 13 larger islands in this Pacific archipelago and have maximum island body weights between 900 and 12 000 g. The distribution of body sizes does not match mitochondrial clades, indicating that body size evolves independently of genetic relatedness. Marine iguanas lack intra- and inter-specific food competition and predators are not size-specific, discounting these factors as selective agents influencing body size. Instead I hypothesize that body size reflects the trade-offs between sexual and natural selection. We found that sexual selection continuously favours larger body sizes. Large males establish display territories and some gain over-proportional reproductive success in the iguanas' mating aggregations. Females select males based on size and activity and are thus responsible for the observed mating skew. However, large individuals are strongly selected against during El Nimo-related famines when dietary algae disappear from the intertidal foraging areas. We showed that differences in algae sward ('pasture') heights and thermal constraints on large size are causally responsible for differences in maximum body size among populations. I hypothesize that body size in many animal species reflects a trade-off between foraging constraints and sexual selection and suggest that future research could focus on physiological and genetic mechanisms determining body size in wild animals. Furthermore, evolutionary stable body size distributions within populations should be analysed to better understand selection pressures on individual body size.",10.1098/rspb.2005.3205,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

The aquatic insects that live in these habitats are strongly influenced by 2 main groups of constraints, physicochemical and biological factors. Taxa particularly well-represented in temporary running waters are the Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and tipulid and chironomid Diptera. With the exception of Ephemeroptera, all these groups are common also in temporary lentic waters, but the latter also support many species of Odonata, together with culicid, ceratopogonid and ephydrid Diptera. In general, however, the diversity of aquatic insects is lower in temporary than in permanent waters. Seasonal succession of species is commonplace in temporary waters, affecting food web structure. Adaptations to drought are reviewed, and traits common to the most successful tara include a highly flexible life cycle, temperature-linked development, possession of a diapausing or otherwise protected egg, and high powers of dispersal. A trend towards terrestrialisation of immature stages is noted amongst at least some members of even strongly aquatic taxa. Several directions for future research are discussed including study of the controlling influence of the biological environment on the fauna and the former's interaction with physicochemical influences, temporal variation in the structure of food webs, and genetic analyses of populations. A recommendation is made for greater quantification in data collection particularly on seasonal changes in species abundance, their life histories, and trophic relationships, as this will allow greater opportunity for modelling the community dynamics of these ecologically distinct habitats.

In the niche model, each species has three traits, niche position, diet position and feeding range. Here, a new probabilistic niche model, which allows the maximum likelihood set of trait values to be estimated for each species, is applied to the food web of the Benguela fishery. We also developed the allometric niche model, in which body size is used as the niche dimension. About 80% of the links in the empirical data are predicted by the probabilistic niche model, a significant improvement over recent models. As in the niche model, species are uniformly distributed on the niche axis. Feeding ranges are exponentially distributed, but diet positions are not uniformly distributed below the predator. Species traits are strongly correlated with body size, but the allometric niche model performs significantly worse than the probabilistic niche model. The best-fit parameter set provides a significantly better model of the structure of the Benguela food web than was previously available. The methodology allows the identification of a number of taxa that stand out as outliers either in the model's poor performance at predicting their predators or prey or in their parameter values.

However, co-occurrence patterns are rarely studied across multiple ecosystems or multiple scales of biological organization within the same study. Here we outline an approach to produce co-occurrence analyses that are focused at three different scales: co-occurrence patterns between ecosystems at the community scale, modules of co-occurring microorganisms within communities, and co-occurring pairs within modules that are nested within microbial communities. To demonstrate our co-occurrence analysis approach, we gathered publicly available 16S rRNA amplicon datasets to compare and contrast microbial co-occurrence at different taxonomic levels across different ecosystems. We found differences in community composition and co-occurrence that reflect environmental filtering at the community scale and consistent pairwise occurrences that may be used to infer ecological traits about poorly understood microbial taxa. However, we also found that conclusions derived from applying network statistics to microbial relationships can vary depending on the taxonomic level chosen and criteria used to build co-occurrence networks.

Theory predicts that behavioral and coloration conspicuousness should vary in tandem along the conspicuousness spectrum for antipredator strategies to be effective. Here we used visual modeling of contrast and behavioral observations to examine the conspicuousness of four populations of the granular poison frog, Oophaga granulifera, which exhibits almost continuous variation in dorsal color. The patterns of geographic variation in color, visual contrast, and behavior support a gradient of overall conspicuousness along the distribution of O. granulifera. Red and green populations, at the extremes of the color distribution, differ in all elements of color, contrast, and behavior, strongly reflecting aposematic and cryptic strategies. However, there is no smooth cline in any elements of behavior or coloration between the two extremes. Instead populations of intermediate colors attain intermediate conspicuousness by displaying different combinations of aposematic and cryptic traits.

Much of this complexity is commonly attributed to stochastic factors that have very high-degrees of freedom. Orthodox study of the evolution of these simple networks has generally been limited in its ability to explain complexity, since it restricts evolutionary adaptation to an inertia-free process with few degrees of freedom in which only gradual, moderately complex behaviors are possible. We propose a model inspired by particle-mediated field phenomena in classical physics in combination with fundamental concepts in adaptation, which suggests that small but high-dimensional chaotic dynamics near to the adaptive trait optimum could help explain complex properties shared by most ecological datasets, such as aperiodicity and pink, fractal noise spectra. By examining a simple predator-prey model and appealing to real ecological data, we show that this type of complexity could be easily confused for or confounded by stochasticity, especially when spurred on or amplified by stochastic factors that share variational and spectral properties with the underlying dynamics.",10.1103/PhysRevE.95.042401,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

"Wilson, HM; Flint, PL; Powell, AN; Grand, JB; Moran, CL",2012,"Population Ecology of Breeding Pacific Common Eiders on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska",WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS,"Populations of Pacific common eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska declined by 50-90% from 1957 to 1992 and then stabilized at reduced numbers from the early 1990s to the present. We investigated the underlying processes affecting their population dynamics by collection and analysis of demographic data from Pacific common eiders at 3 sites on the YKD (1991-2004) for 29 site-years. We examined variation in components of reproduction, tested hypotheses about the influence of specific ecological factors on life-history variables, and investigated their relative contributions to local population dynamics. Reproductive output was low and variable, both within and among individuals, whereas apparent survival of adult females was high and relatively invariant (0.89 +/- 0.005). All reproductive parameters varied across study sites and years. Clutch initiation dates ranged from 4 May to 28 June, with peak (modal) initiation occurring on 26 May. Females at an island study site consistently initiated clutches 3-5 days earlier in each year than those on 2 mainland sites. Population variance in nest initiation date was negatively related to the peak, suggesting increased synchrony in years of delayed initiation. On average, total clutch size (laid) ranged from 4.8 to 6.6 eggs, and declined with date of nest initiation. After accounting for partial predation and non-viability of eggs, average clutch size at hatch ranged from 2.0 to 5.8 eggs. Within seasons, daily survival probability (DSP) of nests was lowest during egg-laying and late-initiation dates. Estimated nest survival varied considerably across sites and years (mean 0.55, range: 0.06-0.92), but process variance in nest survival was relatively low (0.02, CI: 0.01-0.05), indicating that most variance was likely attributed to sampling error. We found evidence that observer effects may have reduced overall nest survival by 0.0-0.36 across site-years. Study sites with lower sample sizes and more frequent visitations appeared to experience greater observer effects. In general, Pacific common eiders exhibited high spatio-temporal variance in reproductive components. Larger clutch sizes and high nest survival at early initiation dates suggested directional selection favoring early nesting. However, stochastic environmental effects may have precluded response to this apparent selection pressure. Our results suggest that females breeding early in the season have the greatest reproductive value, as these birds lay the largest clutches and have the highest probability of successfully hatching. We developed stochastic, stage-based, matrix population models that incorporated observed spatio-temporal (process) variance and co-variation in vital rates, and projected the stable stage distribution (w) and population growth rate (lambda). We used perturbation analyses to examine the relative influence of changes in vital rates on lambda and variance decomposition to assess the proportion of variation in lambda explained by process variation in each vital rate. In addition to matrix-based lambda, we estimated lambda using capture-recapture approaches, and log-linear regression. We found the stable age distribution for Pacific common eiders was weighted heavily towards experienced adult females (>= 4 yr of age), and all calculations of l indicated that the YKD population was stable to slightly increasing (lambda(matrix) 1.02, CI: 1.00-1.04); lambda(reverse-capture-recapture) 1.05, CI: 0.99-1. 11; lambda(log-linear) 1.04, CI: 0.98-1.10). Perturbation analyses suggested the population would respond most dramatically to changes in adult female survival (relative influence of adult survival was 1.5 times that of fecundity), whereas retrospective variation in lambda was primarily explained by fecundity parameters (60%), particularly duckling survival (42%). Among components of fecundity, sensitivities were highest for duckling survival, suggesting this vital rate may be a current restriction to further population growth. Increasing adult survival would have the largest positive effects on population growth, but practical ways to influence this vital rate are currently limited. Given that eider laying dates and nest fates may be closely tied to those of sympatrically nesting species, we hypothesize that management actions facilitating early nesting and targeting other species (e. g., increasing overall potential for predator-swamping) may have positive, concurrent effects on nesting common eiders. If enhancing population growth is the objective and assuming the population is not currently at carrying capacity, we recommend an adaptive management approach. This approach would begin with focused efforts towards increasing reproductive output, with particular emphasis on strategies to increase both fecundity and nest survival, such as predator control on breeding grounds, followed by evaluation of population response. However, we conducted our modeling efforts under assumptions of density independence, whereas density-dependent mechanisms may have played an important role in the historic decline and subsequent stabilization of our population at a new, lower equilibrium. In an adaptive-management context, our results can be used to test additional (density-related) models; our predicted response would be compared with actual population response to prescribed management manipulations. Failure of the population to positively respond to increases in vital rates and negative correlations among vital rates would serve as evidence of density-dependent regulation. Rejection of the density-independent model would support management actions focused on habitat improvement.

"WINEMILLER, KO",1991,ECOMORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION IN LOWLAND FRESH-WATER FISH ASSEMBLAGES FROM 5 BIOTIC REGIONS,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"This study investigates the relationships among species diversity, community structure, and convergent evolution among divergent fish faunas. Morphological traits can be used as surrogates for ecological data in the comparative study of community niche relationships. In the present study I examined 30 morphological features related to the ecology of the dominant fish species from lowland stream and backwater habitats in five widely separated geographic regions: nearctic Alaska, temperate North America, Central America, South America, and tropical Africa. The study regions exhibited a general gradient of species richness from a minimum of 6 dominant species at one of the high-latitude sites (65-degrees-N) to a maximum of 43 numerically dominant species at a neotropical site (8-degrees-N). Fishes from Alaskan sites near the edge of the polar circle tended to be larger than fishes at other sites. Mean values for most morphological characters varied little between regions, indicating similar faunal centroids in morphological space. Morphological diversification within fish assemblages was estimated from species similarities based on Euclidean distances plus species projections on the principal axes from multivariate analysis. The total morphological space encompassed by ichthyofaunas in both stream and backwater sites was generally concordant with the latitudinal and species-richness gradient, with low-diversity nearctic assemblages exhibiting little morphological diversification relative to high-diversity tropical faunas. The Central American assemblages showed a greater range of ecomorphological diversification than African assemblages that contained a few more species, and this pattern may be related to greater seasonal stability at the Central American site. Phenetic patterns of dispersion reflect ecological relationships in which greater numbers of coexisting species are associated with higher levels of niche diversification and ecological specialization, leading to enhanced resource partitioning. Without additional ecological information, a community morphological analysis cannot directly determine whether or not increased ecological specialization is associated with the addition of new resources on the fringes of resource space or with increased subdivision of previously utilized core resources. Based on ecological information gathered concurrently with the fishes used in this analysis, I conclude that close species packing in morphological space is associated with niche generalists rather than with niche compression. With the possible exception of the two high-latitude sites, assemblages that contained more fish species generally did not exhibit tighter packing in niche space than species-poor assemblages, and this result was observed for comparisons both within and between regions. In contrast with several earlier studies, I interpret the lack of correlation between species richness and the average minimum distance between species in assemblage morphospace as being entirely consistent with the observed expansion of morphospace with species richness and latitude. Morphological patterns show that average spacing is held more or less constant as the variety of ecomorphological configurations increases in more-speciose fish assemblages. Even though morphological characters reflect community relationships, tight packing near the center of faunal morphospace actually indicates the opposite of species packing (niche compression) in the traditional sense of resource-utilization curves. The analysis supports the thesis that species interactions are important determinants of community morphological features, particularly in species-rich tropical regions. Relative to assemblages in the other four regions, the two Alaskan fish assemblages were hyperdispersed within a comparatively small morphological space. The Alaskan fish assemblages probably formed via geologically recent, and perhaps repeated, colonizations of polar freshwaters by species with evolutionary histories in more diverse southern and coastal fish faunas. I interpret evidence of greater niche diversification at lower latitudes within a habitat type as being derived primarily from the influence of competition and predation, whereas differences between habitats within regions seems to be associated with the combined effects of biotic interactions and differences in habitat volume and heterogeneity. Even though different regions within ecomorphological space were dominated by different fish orders, numerous ecomorphological convergences and several one-for-one ecological equivalents were identified within different biotic regions.",10.2307/2937046,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,Broad,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,,couldn't get traits but know they're morphologoical from abstract

An organism's growth parameters are expected to depend on environmental constraints, such as predation risk and food supply. However, antipredator responses, food intake, and thus growth of an animal may be mediated by behavioural traits, which are likely to differ among developmental stages. In this study, it was investigated how the relationship between growth and behavioural antipredator responses changes during ontogeny in the time-constrained dragonfly species Libellula depressa, and which factors influenced specific behavioural decisions at different points in ontogeny.2. The results revealed that behavioural strategies differed between larval developmental sages, depending on associations between larval growth, food supply, and predation risk. Early in ontogeny, faster development was correlated with high larval activity and high food supply. This resulted in high activity levels under high food conditions irrespectively of predator presence, and under low food supply in predator absence only. In the intermediate stage of development, all larvae displayed a high activity level, which was correlated in general with fast development. However, growth later in ontogeny was not only influenced by the activity level, but also by predator presence and food supply, with larvae reared under high food supply and/or in presence of predators attaining a higher final mass. Thus, not only the way in which larval growth parameters and behaviour are related changed during development, but also whether the factors influenced larval growth and behaviour. Once the larvae reached the ultimate stage of development, in which they overwinter, behavioural patterns observed were consistent with model predictions.3. It is advocated that behavioural plasticity of prey organisms in different developmental stages should be analysed in the context of associated growth variables.",10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00902.x,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Wollenberg, KC; Veith, M; Lotters, S",2014,Expanding the understanding of local community assembly in adaptive radiations,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Communities are thought to be assembled by two types of filters: by the environment relating to the fundamental niche and by biotic interactions relating to the realized niche. Both filters include parameters related to functional traits and their variation along environmental gradients. Here, we infer the general importance of environmental filtering of a functional trait determining local community assembly within insular adaptive radiations on the example of Caribbean Anolis lizards. We constructed maps for the probability of presence of Anolis ecomorphs (ecology-morphology-behavior specialists) on the Greater Antilles and overlaid these to estimate ecomorph community completeness (ECC) over the landscape. We then tested for differences in environmental parameter spaces among islands for real and cross-fitted ECC values to see whether the underlying assembly filters are deterministic (i.e., similar among islands). We then compared information-theoretic models of climatic and landscape parameters among Greater Antillean islands and inferred whether body mass as functional trait determines ECC. We found areas with high ECC to be strongly correlated with environmental filters, partly related to elevation. The environmental parameters influencing high ECC differed among islands. With the exception of the Jamaican twig ecomorph (which we suspect to be misclassified), smaller ecomorphs were more restricted to higher elevations than larger ones which might reflect filtering on the basis of differential physiological restrictions of ecomorphs. Our results in Anolis show that local community assembly within adaptive island radiations of animals can be determined by environmental filtering of functional traits, independently from species composition and realized environmental niche space.",10.1002/ece3.908,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Herps,Seasonal Tropical Forest,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = body dize, relative limb and tail length, number of lamellae on the toe pad, color",

As knowledge of grassland insect communities is limited, the lag between the initiation of restoration and the ability of these new habitats to contribute to such processes is unclear. Using ten data sets, ranging from 3 to 14 years, we investigate the lag between restoration and the establishment of phytophagous beetle assemblages typical of species rich grasslands. We used traits and ecological characteristics to determine factors limiting beetle colonisation, and also considered how food-web structure changed during restoration. For sites where seed addition of host-plants occurred the success in replicating beetle assemblages increased over time following a negative exponential function. Extrapolation beyond the existing data set tentatively suggested that success would plateau after 20 years, representing a c. 60% increase in assemblage similarity to target grasslands. In the absence of seed addition, similarity to the target grasslands showed no increase over time. Where seed addition was used the connectance of plant-herbivore food webs decreased over time, approaching values typical of species rich grasslands after c. 7 years. This trend was, however, dependent on the inclusion of a single site containing data in excess of 6 years of restoration management. Beetles not capable of flight, those showing high degrees of host-plant specialisation and species feeding on nationally rare host plants take between 1 and 3 years longer to colonise. Successful grassland restoration is underpinned by the establishment of host-plants, although individual species traits compound the effects of poor host-plant establishment to slow colonisation. The use of pro-active grassland restoration to mitigate against future environmental change should account for lag periods in excess of 10 years if the value of these habitats is to be fully realised.

Which environmental factors influence resource polymorphism in lakes?",EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,"Background: The mechanisms causing resource polymorphism are not well understood, but likely include frequency-dependent selection. However, other selection mechanisms could also explain the development of resource polymorphism. Comparative analyses of polymorphic and monomorphic systems are uncommon, making it difficult to distinguish the effects of geography, frequency-dependent selection, niche expansion, and species interactions. Detailing ecological conditions associated with the development of resource polymorphism is necessary to discern demographic and environmental processes that may cause it. Goal: Test for environmental correlations with (a) the presence of resource polymorphism and (b) the degree of differentiation in polymorphic systems, to evaluate the hypotheses that the development of resource polymorphism results from (1) frequency dependence, (2) expansion to include a zooplanktivorous niche, or (3) lower survivorship due to predation on intermediate trait values. Trends in prey consumption, as they related to the presence of polymorphism and limnetic lake characteristics, were also analysed. Organism: Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) populations from lakes sampled in 1994-2004 across Iceland. Methods: Random forest and multiple regression models assessing the presence and degree of resource polymorphism using environmental variables reflecting physical, chemical, and biological conditions. Prey consumption was fitted to the presence of polymorphism and brown trout abundance in negative binomial generalized linear models. The proportion of individuals consuming zooplankton within monomorphic versus polymorphic populations was also measured to test the idea that more widespread zooplankton consumption reflects niche expansion. Results: In Iceland, polymorphic populations tended to occur in cooler lakes with few brown trout (Salmo trutta), a trophic competitor, and in lakes where Arctic charr consumed more zooplankton. Lakes with greater limnetic habitat, fewer nutrients, and greater potential to consume zooplankton appeared to promote resource polymorphism, thereby supporting the presence of niche expansion. The overall results supported the frequency dependence hypothesis, as well as the niche expansion hypothesis in most cases. However, morphs that differed in consumption of fish or chironomid pupae rather than zooplankton were also evident, indicating that mechanisms other than niche expansion may also be important.

Here, we compare the relative effects of hydrology, physical habitat, and co-occurring fish functional traits on the contemporary (1950-1990) distribution of the American eel Anguilla rostrata in six Mid-Atlantic (USA) rivers. To do so, we implement a null model approach that compares conditions at sites of known American eel presence to a random sample of sites throughout a broader landscape, allowing us to identify variables that may have the strongest influences on American eel distribution. Results suggest that, within this subset of the American eel's geographic range, the functional characteristics of locally co-occurring fishes and habitat fragmentation by dams may have the strongest influences on American eel distribution, compared to other predictor variables included in the analysis. Given the widespread distribution and complex biology of this species, we caution that our results may not apply to all American eel subpopulations or life stages. Nonetheless, the observed importance of co-occurring fish functional traits may inform American eel conservation and, more generally, provide a means to incorporate biotic influences in research on species' distributions.",10.1111/ecog.03782,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,0,0,1,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = fecundity per female per spawning season, incubation time from embryo fertilization to hatch, length of spawning season, locomotion mode, accelerators, swimming type",

"Woodward, G; Hildrew, AG",2002,Food web structure in riverine landscapes,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Most research on freshwater (and other) food webs has focused on apparently discrete communities, in well-defined habitats at small spatial and temporal scales, whereas in reality food webs are embedded in complex landscapes, such as river corridors. Food web linkages across such landscapes may be crucial for ecological pattern and process, however. Here, we consider the importance of large scale influences upon lotic food webs across the three spatial dimensions and through time. 2. We assess the roles of biotic factors (e.g. predation, competition) and physical habitat features (e.g. geology, land-use, habitat fragmentation) in moulding food web structure at the landscape scale. As examples, external subsidies to lotic communities of nutrients, detritus and prey vary along the river corridor, and food web links are made and broken across the land-water interface with the rise and fall of the flood. 3. We identify several avenues of potentially fruitful research, particularly the need to quantify energy flow and population dynamics. Stoichiometric analysis of changes in C : N : P nutrient ratios over large spatial gradients (e.g. from river source to mouth, in forested versus agricultural catchments), offers a novel method of uniting energy flow and population dynamics to provide a more holistic view of riverine food webs from a landscape perspective. Macroecological approaches can be used to examine large-scale patterns in riverine food webs (e.g. trophic rank and species-area relationships). New multivariate statistical techniques can be used to examine community responses to environmental gradients and to assign traits to individual species (e.g. body-size, functional feeding group), to unravel the organisation and trophic structure of riverine food webs.",10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00908.x,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Broad,River,0,1,0,1,1,Multiple,3,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = stable isotopes, body size, coloration, predator avoidance, competitive ability",

In migratory birds, density-dependence is most often studied during the breeding season, yet we still lack a robust understanding of the reproductive traits through which density influences individual reproductive success. We used 27-yr of detailed, individual-level productivity data from an island-breeding population of Savannah sparrows Passerculus sandwichensis to evaluate effects of local and total annual population density on female reproductive success. Local density (number of neighbors within 50 m of a female's nest) had stronger effects on the number of young fledged than did total annual population density. Females nesting in areas of high local density were more likely to suffer nest predation and less likely to initiate and fledge a second clutch, which led to fewer young fledged in a season. Fledging fewer young subsequently decreased the likelihood of a female recruiting offspring into the breeding population in a subsequent year. Collectively, these results provide insight into the scale and reproductive mechanisms mediating density-dependent reproductive success and fitness in songbirds.",10.1002/ecy.1911,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Recent research has shown that plant responses to climate change are phylogenetically conserved such that species within some lineages are more productive than those within other lineages in changing environments. However, it remains unclear how phylogenetic patterns in plant responses to changing abiotic conditions may be altered by another agent of global change, the introduction of non-native species. Using a system of 28 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species belonging to two subgenera, Symphyomyrtus and Eucalyptus, we hypothesized that productivity responses to abiotic agents of global change (elevated CO2 and increased soil N) are unique to lineages, but that novel interactions with a non-native species mediate these responses. We tested this hypothesis by examining productivity of 1) native species monocultures and 2) mixtures of native species with an introduced hardwood plantation species, Eucalyptus nitens, to experimentally manipulated soil N and atmospheric CO2. Consistent with past research, we found that N limits productivity overall, especially in elevated CO2 conditions. However, monocultures of species within the Symphyomyrtus subgenus showed the strongest response to N (gained 127% more total biomass) in elevated CO2 conditions, whereas those within the Eucalyptus subgenus did not respond to N. Root: shoot ratio (an indicator of resource use) was on average greater in species pairs containing Symphyomyrtus species, suggesting that functional traits important for resource uptake are phylogenetically conserved and explaining the phylogenetic pattern in plant response to changing environmental conditions. Yet, native species mixtures with E. nitens exhibited responses to CO2 and N that differed from those of monocultures, supporting our hypothesis and highlighting that both plant evolutionary history and introduced species will shape community productivity in a changing world.",10.1371/journal.pone.0114596,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Past work, including many studies of marine food webs, has primarily documented the existence of indirect effects and how particular examples arise. Future challenges include (1) developing methods for the systematic detection of indirect effects, (2) documenting the functions describing different classes of interaction modifications, (3) exploring methods to predict indirect effects, including measurement of interaction strengths among species, (4) integrating time-scale differences into the theory of indirect effects, and (5) linking indirect effects and environmental variability.

Near-future climate predictions indicate that salinity will decrease in many shallow coastal areas due to increased precipitation; however, few studies have addressed this issue. The ability of ecosystems to cope with future changes will depend on species' capacities to acclimatise or adapt to new environmental conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of a strong salinity gradient (the Baltic Sea system - Baltic, Kattegat, Skagerrak) on plasticity and adaptations in the euryhaline barnacle Balanus improvisus. We used a common-garden approach, where multiple batches of newly settled barnacles from each of three different geographical areas along the Skagerrak-Baltic salinity gradient were exposed to corresponding native salinities (6, 15 and 30 PSU), and phenotypic traits including mortality, growth, shell strength, condition index and reproductive maturity were recorded.Results: We found that B. improvisus was highly euryhaline, but had highest growth and reproductive maturity at intermediate salinities. We also found that low salinity had negative effects on other fitness-related traits including initial growth and shell strength, although mortality was also lowest in low salinity. Overall, differences between populations in most measured traits were weak, indicating little local adaptation to salinity. Nonetheless, we observed some population-specific responses - notably that populations from high salinity grew stronger shells in their native salinity compared to the other populations, possibly indicating adaptation to differences in local predation pressure.Conclusions: Our study shows that B. improvisus is an example of a true brackish-water species, and that plastic responses are more likely than evolutionary tracking in coping with future changes in coastal salinity.",10.1186/1471-2148-14-156,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Marine,Other,Broad,1,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = mortality, growth, shell strength, condition index and reproductive maturity, salinity tolerance",

Here, we examine how aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) respond to climate, soil and community structure across alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. We found that both ANPP and PUE showed nonlinear patterns along water availability and site altitude variation, which together accounted for 80.3% and 68.8% of variation in ANPP and PUE, respectively, by optimal generalized additive models. Functional trait divergence (FTD) and community weighted mean (CWM) of plant functional traits were as important as plant species diversity (PSD) for explaining the nonlinear productivity-climate relationship. These findings were confirmed by results from principal component analyses and structural equation models.

Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them.

Location The eastern USA. Methods We coupled a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) with nine species-specific plant traits and a continental-scale forest inventory dataset to perform our analyses. Mass effects were estimated using the next grain size up as the metacommunity (or the eastern USA at the subregion grain, and also at the 1 degrees grid cell grain in a fourth analysis). Permutation tests were conducted to test the significance of trait constraints. The Kullback-Leibler divergence index was used to decompose the information content in each assemblage SRA. Results Trait constraints were significant in predicting community structures at coarse scales, but were largely not significant at fine or medium scales. At the 0.07 ha grain little of the variation in local SRA can be explained by either trait constraints or a regional SRA. At the 1 degrees grain c. 61% of the variation could be accounted for by a regional SRA represented by subregions. At the subregion grain c. 74% of the variation could be accounted for by trait constraints and the SRA of the entire study area. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the relative importance of community assembly processes is scale dependent. Estimated mass effects predominated at small spatial scales where environmental gradients were weak. Trait-based selection was hard to detect at small scales and was strongest at large scales where environmental gradients are stronger.

We additionally reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the sampled butterfly species and investigated morphology-elevation relationships within an evolutionary framework. Butterfly assemblages were consistently darker and larger at higher elevations across three replicate locations.

Using phylogenetic-based and functional trait-based methods jointly to explore these processes along environmental gradients are useful ways to explain the change of assembly mechanisms under changing world. Our study combined these methods to test assembly processes in wide range gradients of elevation and other habitat environmental factors. We collected our data at 40 plots in Taibai Mountain, China, with more than 2,300m altitude difference in study area and then measured traits and environmental factors. Variance partitioning was used to distinguish the main environment factors leading to phylogeny and traits change among 40 plots. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to colligate other environment factors. Community assembly patterns along environmental gradients based on phylogenetic and functional methods were studied for exploring assembly mechanisms. Phylogenetic signal was calculated for each community along environmental gradients in order to detect the variation of trait performance on phylogeny. Elevation showed a better explanatory power than other environment factors for phylogenetic and most traits' variance. Phylogenetic and several functional structure clustered at high elevation while some conserved traits overdispersed. Convergent tendency which might be caused by filtering or competition along elevation was detected based on functional traits. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf nitrogen content along PCA 1 axis showed conflicting patterns comparing to patterns showed on elevation. LDMC exhibited the strongest phylogenetic signal.

Differences among the three fish species in the temporal variation in abundance of each age class (mainly 1- and 2-year age classes) indicated that the temporal pattern of utilization of the seagrass meadow were different among them. In the semi-quantitative dietary analysis, two prey categories, i.e., taxonomic group (order and suborder) and functional group, were used to explain the variation in prey composition with size-dependent changes. The six prey functional groups were classified based on the ecological traits of the prey, i.e., trophic level, size, and life type (habitat and behavior). Ontogenetic shifts in prey of the three fish species could be fully explained by a combination of the two prey categories, and not by the use of only one category (taxonomic or functional group). The pattern of ontogenetic shifts in prey differed among the fish species and size (age) classes.

Rapid adaptation can result from either rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity, but their effects on population dynamics are seldom compared directly. Here we examine theoretically the effects of rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity of antipredatory defense on predator-prey dynamics. Our analyses reveal that phenotypic plasticity tends to stabilize population dynamics more strongly than rapid evolution. It is therefore important to know the mechanism by which phenotypic variation is generated for predicting the dynamics of rapidly adapting populations. We next examine an advantage of a phenotypically plastic prey genotype over the polymorphism of specialist prey genotypes. Numerical analyses reveal that the plastic genotype, if there is a small cost for maintaining it, cannot coexist with the pairs of specialist counterparts unless the system has a limit cycle. Furthermore, for the plastic genotype to replace specialist genotypes, a forced environmental fluctuation is critical in a broad parameter range. When these results are combined, the plastic genotype enjoys an advantage with population oscillations, but plasticity tends to lose its advantage by stabilizing the oscillations. This dilemma leads to an interesting intermittent limit cycle with the changing frequency of phenotypic plasticity.",10.1086/661241,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Hairworms (phylum Nematomorpha) require both aquatic and terrestrial hosts to complete their life cycle. Although hairworm host competencies have been tested in laboratory experiments, knowledge of the paratenic hosts (aquatic insect larvae) in their natural habitats is limited. This study clarified the species of aquatic insect larvae that are primarily infected by hairworms as paratenic hosts over a year in a mountain stream in central Honshu, Japan. The monthly prevalence and mean abundance of hairworm cysts were high in Ephemera japonica larvae (Ephemeridae: Ephemeroptera) throughout the study period (20.0-88.9 and 0.2-36.8%, respectively). These high prevalence and abundance values may be attributable to their filter-feeding behavior as well as their depositional habitat use. The hairworms also infected leptophlebiids (Ephemeroptera; scrapers), the perlid Calineulia sp., the chloroperlid Haploperla japonica (Plecoptera; predators), and chironomids (Diptera; filter-feeders or predators). The abundance of the cysts tended to be high in aquatic insects inhabiting pools rather than riffles, and the seasonality reflects the reproductive season of the hairworms as well as the phenology of their paratenic hosts. Filter-feeding ephemeropterans inhabiting pools were the major paratenic host of the hairworms in our study site, although their universality and effectiveness as the transporter to definitive hosts remain unclear.",10.1645/15-887,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

In the null model, species traits were constrained between the maximum and minimum trait values of observed communities to test the principle of limiting similarity between co-existing species by testing for even spacing of traits. We analysed traits characterizing growth strategies of stems, leaves and twigs, measured at the level of individuals in situ. Results After accounting for variations in trait range, it became evident that six out of eight traits showed significantly uneven spacing within some plots, notably towards the forest end of the gradient, i.e. under increased competition pressure among woody plants. The Wilcoxon rank test showed that seven out of eight traits were significantly unevenly spaced within plots.

Random intercept and random slope models of different explanatory variables were compared with respect to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).Important FindingsSurvival rates differed largely between the 10 shrub species, ranging from 26% to 91% for Ardisia crenata and Distylium buxifolium, respectively. Irrespective of species identity, single abiotic factors explained up to 5% of species survival, with a negative effect of altitude and slope inclination and a positive effect of the topsoil carbon to nitrogen ratio, which pointed to drought as the major cause of shrub mortality. In contrast, neither tree nor shrub richness affected shrub survival at this early stage of the experiment. Among the biotic predictors, only herb layer species richness and cover of the dominant fern species (Dicranopteris pedata) affected shrub survival. Overall, our models that included all variables could explain about 65% in shrub survival, with environmental variables being most influential, followed by shrub species identity, while tree species diversity (species richness and identity) and herb layer characteristics contributed much less. Thus, in this early stage of the experiment the biotic interactions among shrubs and between shrubs and trees have not yet overruled the impact of abiotic environmental factors.",10.1093/jpe/rtw099,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Increasingly, ecologists are using functional and phylogenetic approaches to quantify the relative importance of stochastic, abiotic filtering and biotic filtering processes shaping the pattern of species co-occurrence. A remaining challenge in functional and phylogenetic analyses of tropical tree communities is to successfully integrate the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree communities across spatial and size scales and habitats in a single analysis. 2. We analysed the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree assemblages in a 20-ha tropical forest dynamics plot in south-west China. Because the influence of biotic interactions may become more apparent as cohorts age, on local scales, and in resource-rich environments, we perform our analyses across three size classes, six spatial scales and six distinct habitat types, using 10 plant functional traits and a molecular phylogeny for the >400 tree taxa found in the plot. 3. All traits, except leaf area and stem-specific resistance, had significant, albeit weak phylogenetic signal. For canopy species, phylogenetic clustering in small and medium size classes turned to phylogenetic overdispersion in the largest size class and this change in dispersion with size was found in each habitat type and across all spatial scales. On fine spatial scales, functional dispersion changed from clustering to overdispersion with increasing size classes. However, on larger spatial scales assemblages were functionally clustered for all size classes and habitats. 4. Phylogenetic and functional structure across spatial and size scales and habitats gave strong support for a deterministic model of species co-occurrence rather than for a neutral model. The results also support the hypothesis that abiotic determinism is more important at larger scales, while biotic determinism is more important on smaller scales within habitats.",10.1111/1365-2435.12176,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Seasonal Tropical Forest,0,1,0,1,0,Multiple,2,1,0,1,,,0,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = leaf area, SLA, leaf chlorophyll content, LDMC, leaf thickness, max height, stem specific resistance, seed mass, life form, seed dormancy",

However, previous models often abstracted away the physical manifestation of the focal animals such that the influence of getting stuck in a crowded herd on individual adaptation was less intensively investigated. Here, we propose an evolutionary model to simulate the adaptation of egoistic social prey to predation given that individual mobility is strictly restrained by the presence of other conspecifics. In our simulated evolutionary races, agents were set to either be confined by neighbours or move to empty cells on the lattice, and the behavioural traits of those less exposed were selected and inherited. Our analyses show that under this crowded environment, cohesive and steady herds were consistently replaced by morphing and moving aggregates via the attempt of border agents to share predation risk with the inner members. This kind of collective motion emerges purely from the competition among selfish individuals regardless of any group benefit. Our findings reveal that including the crowding effect with the selfish herd scenario permits additional diversity in the predicted outcomes and imply that a wider set of collective animal behaviours are explainable purely by individual-level selection.",10.1038/s41598-019-43179-6,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Variability in species composition, composed by differences in species richness (nestedness) and/or species replacement, may be caused by niche availability and environmental selection. A field survey was carried out in Tibetan plateau on 38 lakes. Tibetan plateau lakes, located at high elevation, are harsh ecosystems characterized by low temperatures, low available nutrients, high UV amount, and strong salinity gradients. Only well-adapted species can survive in these environments. We therefore hypothesized that environmental filtering was the main factor determining phytoplankton assemblage structure in these lakes, and that species nestedness largely contributed to beta-diversity. Spatial analysis showed that both environmental variables and broad-scale spatial variables accounted for the variation of phytoplankton assemblages. In particular, phytoplankton was mainly shaped by spatially structured environmental heterogeneity, which resulted in low alpha-diversity and high beta-diversity. In contrast to our assumption, species turnover contributed to the majority of beta-diversity of the studied assemblages.

Therefore, new approaches, such as plant trait-based methods, are urgently needed to replace PFT schemes when predicting the distribution of vegetation and investigating vegetation sensitivity. As an important direction towards constructing next-generation DGVMs based on plant functional traits, we propose a novel approach for modelling vegetation distributions and analysing vegetation sensitivity through trait-climate relationships in China. The results demonstrated that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) trained with a LMA-N-mass-LAI data combination yielded an accuracy of 72.82% in simulating vegetation distribution, providing more detailed parameter information regarding community structures and ecosystem functions.

A lot of ecologists consider that this is unreasonable, because intraspecific variation significantly affects various ecological dynamics. However, it is not feasible to record the traits of each plant individually at every community site. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine in which circumstances it is most important to account for intraspecific trait variations. We conducted analyses using a trait-based niche-neutral continuum model integrating inter-and intraspecific variance. Then we tested the model through three popular community pattern indexes generated from four kinds of community assembly processes. The results showed that it was more important to consider intraspecific variations in plant communities with large niche overlaps. In such cases, including intraspecific variation increases the number of species and strongly affects the community's abundance structure. In contrast, when there is strong niche differentiation, the contribution of plant intraspecific variation could be neglected. In addition, the species richness and rank-abundance curve were insensitive to the magnitude of intraspecific variation, but plant trait distribution increased exponentially when intraspecific variation was included.

Increasingly, the community ecology and modelling studies recognize that current PFT scheme is not sufficient for simulating ecological processes. Recent advances in the study of plant functional traits (FTs) in community ecology provide a novel and feasible approach for the improvement of PFT-based DGVMs. This paper reviews the development of current DGVMs over recent decades. After characterizing the advantages and disadvantages of the PFT-based scheme, it summarizes trait-based theories and discusses the possibility of incorporating FTs into DGVMs. More importantly, this paper summarizes three strategies for constructing next-generation DGVMs with FTs. Finally, the method's limitations, current challenges and future research directions for FT theory are discussed for FT theory. We strongly recommend the inclusion of several FTs, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), carbon isotope composition of leaves (Leaf C-13), the ratio between leaf-internal and ambient mole fractions of CO2 (Leaf C-i/C-a), seed mass and plant height. These are identified as the most important in constructing DGVMs based on FTs, which are also recognized as important ecological strategies for plants. The integration of FTs into dynamic vegetation models is a critical step towards improving the results of DGVM simulations; communication and cooperation among ecologists and modellers is equally important for the development of the next generation of DGVMs.",10.1177/0309133315582018,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

We sought to identify correlative links between species richness and size diversity, focusing on size diversity as one component of functional diversity. These links could be used to extend individual, size-based models to predict patterns of species richness. We used the distribution of the sizes of individuals in a community - the individual-size distribution (ISD) - as a measure of size diversity, and constructed Bayesian regression models with species richness as the response variable and ISDs as the predictor variables. We used two methods to include ISDs in our analyses. First, we summarized the ISD with five common diversity indices and used these indices as predictor variables in our analyses. Second, we used functional data analysis to include the entire ISD (a continuous function) as a predictor variable in our analyses. Analyses of diversity indices identified consistent, positive associations between species richness and size diversity. Analyses of entire ISDs revealed that these associations were driven by numbers of small- and medium-sized individuals. In general, a combination of diversity indices predicted species richness as well as or better than continuous ISDs. However, models with ISDs as predictor variables were less sensitive to technical details of model fitting (e.g. discretization method) than those based on diversity indices, and the use of ISDs avoids the arbitrary selection of one or several diversity indices.

The structure of these links and their strengths have major consequences for the dynamics and stability of food webs. The existence and strength of particular trophic links has often been assessed using observational data on changes in species abundance through time. Here we show that very strong links can be completely missed by these kinds of analyses when changes in population abundance are accompanied by contemporaneous rapid evolution in the prey or host species. Experimental observations, in rotifer-alga and phage-bacteria chemostats, show that the predator or pathogen can exhibit large-amplitude cycles while the abundance of the prey or host remains essentially constant. We know that the species are tightly linked in these experimental microcosms, but without this knowledge, we would infer from observed patterns in abundance that the species are weakly or not at all linked. Mathematical modeling shows that this kind of cryptic dynamics occurs when there is rapid prey or host evolution for traits conferring defense against attack, and the cost of defense (in terms of tradeoffs with other fitness components) is low. Several predictions of the theory that we developed to explain the rotifer-alga experiments are confirmed in the phage-bacteria experiments, where bacterial evolution could be tracked.

However, individual species are simultaneously positioned in various types of interactions. The ways in which different network types are merged and entangled, and the variations in network structures between different sympatric networks, require full elucidation. Incorporating interaction types and disentangling complex networks is crucial, because the integration of various network architectures has the potential to alter the stability and co-evolutionary dynamics of the whole network. To reveal how different types of interaction networks are entangled, we focused on the interaction between birds and flowers of temperate plants in Japan, where flower-feeding birds are mainly generalist passerines, acting as pollinators and predators of flowers. Using long-term monitoring data, we investigated the flower-feeding episodes of birds. We constructed the whole network (WN) between birds and plants, separating the network into mutualistic and antagonistic sub-networks (MS and AS, respectively). We investigated structural properties of the three quantified networks and species-level characteristics of the main bird species. For bird species, we evaluated dietary similarity, dietary specialization and shifts of feeding behaviour relative to plant traits. Our results indicate that WN comprises entangled MS and AS, sharing considerable proportions of bird and plant assemblages. We observed distinctive differences in the network structural properties between the two sub-networks. In comparison with AS, MS had lower numbers of bird and plant species, showed lower specialization and modularity and exhibited higher nestedness. At the species level, the Japanese white-eye acted as pollinator, while the brown-eared bulbul acted as both pollinator and predator for large numbers of flowers, based on its behavioural plasticity. Overall, the pattern of avian feeding behaviour was influenced by flower size and plant origin. Birds showed nectarivory for plants with medium-sized flowers and exotic origins.

We discuss a population-dynamic approach which plays a central role in the analysis of evolutionary processes. The basic principle is that the phenotypes with the greatest long-term average growth rate will dominate the entire population. The calculation of long-term average growth rates for populations under temporal stochasticity can be highly cumbersome. However, for a discrete non-overlapping population, it is identical to the geometric mean of the growth rates (geometric mean fitness), which is usually different from the simple arithmetic mean of growth rates. Evolutionary outcomes based on geometric mean fitness are often very different from the predictions based on the usual arithmetic mean fitness. In this paper we illustrate the concept of geometric mean fitness in a few simple models. We discuss its implications for the adaptive evolution of phenotypes, e.g. foraging under predation risks and clutch size. Next, we present an application: the risk-spreading egg-laying behaviour of the cabbage white butterfly, and develop a two-patch population dynamic model to show how the optimal solution diverges from the usual arithmetic mean approach. The dynamics of these stochastic models cannot be predicted from the dynamics of simple deterministic models.

In freshwater fishes, inter-population variation in male phenotype is often associated with differences in predation intensity, but these effects can be difficult to disentangle from environmental influences.2. The western rainbowfish Melanotaenia australis exhibits marked sexual dimorphism - females are plain with a slender body, while males have striking coloration and are deeper in the body. Male traits differ in expression among populations, but this has not been described or explored in the literature.3. This paper describes a study designed to test for geographic structuring of male phenotype in M. australis and to determine whether between-population variation in male phenotype is attributable to variation in predation regime, after accounting for environment.4. We collected data describing habitat, and the size, activity and abundance of predators at sites containing M. australis populations. We then used photography, spectrometry and geometric morphometrics to describe colour pattern, spectral reflectance and body shape in males from these populations. Finally, we used permutation-based multivariate statistics to partition variance in these traits according to environment and predation regime.5. Downstream environments posed higher predation risk to M. australis. Furthermore, males from these sites consistently exhibited larger cheek spots and fewer coloured lateral stripes than those from upstream sites. Variation in predation regime accounted for a significant proportion of the total variance in these traits (30 center dot 9%), after controlling for the effects of environment.6. Variation in predation regime did not explain variation in reflectance or shape. Environmental variation, however, explained a significant portion of the total variance in reflectance (74 center dot 9%), and there was a strong trend towards it explaining a portion of the total variance in body shape (34 center dot 9%).7. We conclude that natural selection by predators may be an important determinant of the evolution of colour pattern variation in M. australis, but not of that of body shape or colour reflectance.8.

"Yuan, Chi; Chesson, Peter",2015,The relative importance of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect in the lottery model,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,"Although it is likely that many coexistence mechanisms contribute to maintenance of species diversity, most approaches to understanding species coexistence proceed as if only one mechanism would be present. In studies of species coexistence in a temporally fluctuating environment, the storage effect, believed to be the most important coexistence mechanism, has been the focus. Although a different coexistence mechanism-relative nonlinearity-is also predicted to arise frequently with environmental variation, its effect has been overshadowed by the storage effect. The relatively nonlinear growth rates on which the mechanism depends arise simply from differences in life history traits. Many kinds of temporal variation can then interact with these nonlinearity differences to create the relative nonlinearity coexistence mechanism. Much is unknown about when this mechanism is important and its total neglect is not justified. Here, we use the lottery model to provide a much needed quantitative assessment of the relative and combined effects of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Our analysis takes advantage of recently developed techniques for quantifying coexistence mechanisms when multiple mechanisms operate in concert. We find that relative nonlinearity is able to contribute substantially to species coexistence in the lottery model when two conditions are satisfied: (1) species must differ greatly in their adult death rates, (2) sensitivity of recruitment to environmental variation must be greater for species with larger adult death rates. In addition, relative nonlinearity has a critical role in compensating for a weakened storage effect when there is high correlation between species in their responses to the varying environment. In some circumstances relative nonlinearity is stronger than the storage effect or is even the sole mechanism of coexistence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Incorporating the patchy heterogeneous structure, variation partitioning allowed us to specifically evaluate the fine-scale neutral processes produced by spatial autocorrelation within habitat patches, and the broad-scale dispersal limitations between patches. Only the second subset of spatial variables was significant; dispersal limitation was relatively low between habitat patches of varzea lakes. An analysis of functional ecology allowed an empirical description of the functional mechanisms of alpha and beta niche differentiation, and an assessment of the phylogenetic signal. The trait-convergence assembly pattern among habitat patches indicated that fish in turbid river channels were better adapted to low light than fish in transparent black and clear water bodies. Also, fish in varzea lakes had a wider ecological range; this association indicated phylogenetic niche conservatism. The trait-divergence assembly pattern was almost expressed by body weight and was prominent in varzea lakes; combined with ecological range and sensory adaptation, this association indicated a marginal phylogenetic signal. These results suggest the radiation of species-rich clades with a high degree of sensory adaptation may have occurred in the seasonal environment of varzea lakes. This resulted in larger ecological distribution and innovative life histories tightly synchronized with periodic flooding.

Our analyses demonstrate significant linkages between community size structure and ecosystem functioning, and the effects of warming on these links. Specifically, we show that carbon fluxes were significantly influenced by seasonal variation in temperature, and yielded activation energies remarkably similar to those predicted based on the temperature dependencies of individual-level photosynthesis and respiration.

Nevertheless, information regarding vertebrate ecology in tropical RF is scarce. The studies of bats in riparian habitats have been mostly focused on insectivorous assemblages in non-tropical regions. We contrasted the occurrence of frugivorous bats between RF and upland dry forest (UDF) in a Neotropical dry forest region and evaluated how vegetation structure modulates frugivorous bat presence and abundance. We sampled bat ensembles and vegetation structure in three UDF and three RF sites in Jalisco, Mexico. Bat ensembles and populations were analysed with generalized linear models, including as independent factors: (1) habitat and (2) vegetation attributes. In 72 nights we captured 840 bats belonging to seven species. No effect of habitat type or vegetation structure on species richness was found, but habitat type did affect bat species composition and abundance. Moreover, vegetation structural traits affected frugivorous bat abundance. Frugivore abundance was higher in RF than in UDF probably because RF provides greater resources and more roosting sites. Riparian forests also present more canopy cover and accessible flight spaces. Our results support the importance of RF for frugivorous bats in terms of abundance and composition. Additionally, the lack of differences in species richness between UDF and RF highlights the importance of both habitats for maintaining frugivorous bats, as well as the related ecosystem processes and services in tropical dry forest landscapes.",10.1017/S0266467416000572,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Zayed, A; Constantin, SA; Packer, L",2007,Successful Biological Invasion despite a Severe Genetic Load,PLOS ONE,"Understanding the factors that influence the success of ecologically and economically damaging biological invasions is of prime importance. Recent studies have shown that invasive populations typically exhibit minimal, if any, reductions in genetic diversity, suggesting that large founding populations and/or multiple introductions are required for the success of biological invasions, consistent with predictions of the propagule pressure hypothesis. Through population genetic analysis of neutral microsatellite markers and a gene experiencing balancing selection, we demonstrate that the solitary bee Lasioglossum leucozonium experienced a single and severe bottleneck during its introduction from Europe. Paradoxically, the success of L. leucozonium in its introduced range occurred despite the severe genetic load caused by single-locus complementary sex-determination that still turns 30% of female-destined eggs into sterile diploid males, thereby substantially limiting the growth potential of the introduced population. Using stochastic modeling, we show that L. leucozonium invaded North America through the introduction of a very small number of propagules, most likely a singly-mated female. Our results suggest that chance events and ecological traits of invaders are more important than propagule pressure in determining invasion success, and that the vigilance required to prevent invasions may be considerably greater than has been previously considered.",10.1371/journal.pone.0000868,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

Due to the differences of evolutionary and genetic backgrounds, the formation mechanism of blue shell egg are divergent in different poultries. By using the high-throughput sequencing, the oviduct shell gland of blue egg shell ducks and white egg shell ducks were studied to enrich and analyze microRNAs (miRNAs) and its target genes involved in formation of blue shell egg traits. The analysis result of sequencing data quality showed the GC content of each sample was not less than 42.60%, and the proportion of clean reads that was ?30 bases (Q30) was not less than 89.02%. Compared with the chicken (Gallus gallus) genome sequence (Gallus_gallus-4.0, GCF_000002315.3) using the miRDeep2 software, all 269 miRNAs were screened in the shell gland of blue shelled ducks and white shelled ducks, including known 245 miRNAs and new 24 miRNAs. Based on the expression of miRNAs in each sample, the correlation analysis was performed between the all of each samples. The result showed that the correlation coefficient were higher between all of the shell gland samples in blue and white shelled ducks (r>0.99), which suggested that miRNAs expression profiles might be similar in the shelled gland of blue and white shelled ducks. Compared with white shelled ducks, the shell gland of blue shelled ducks had 169 differently expressed miRNAs, including 85 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated, and total 4 872 target genes were obtained, but the miRNAs were not significant difference (P>0.05). The Top Gene Ontology (TopGO) analysis of target genes showed that molecules function including heme binding (count=23, P=0.008) were existed, and most of them were accompanied by function of electron and Fe2+ transport. In addition, the analysis of differently expressed miRNAs found that biliverdin synthetic gene-heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and a large number of organic matter transport and metabolism genes were predicted by gga-miR-133b, gga-miR-193b-3p and gga-miR-449a (log2 (fold change (FC)) >1, P>0.05).

Over the past decade ecologists have increasingly sought to quantify phylogenetic signals in environmental niche preferences and, especially, traits to help uncover the mechanisms driving plant community assembly. However, relatively little is known about how phylogenetic patterns in environmental niches and traits compare, leaving significant uncertainty about the ecological implications of trait-based analyses. We examined phylogenetic signals within known environmental niches of 64 species, at seedling and adult life stages, in a Chinese tropical forest, to test whether local environmental niches had consistent relationships with phylogenies. Our analyses show that local environmental niches are highly phylogenetically labile for both seedlings and adult trees, with closely related species occupying niches that are no more similar than expected by random chance.

Disentangling ecological processes that influence community assembly and species diversity across spatial scales remains a major goal of community ecology. Community assembly processes influence spatial patterns of species diversity through their interactions with key functional traits. Hence, quantifying spatial patterns of functional trait diversity (FD) represents a useful tool for disentangling the relative importance of abiotic filtering, biotic interactions, random assembly and dispersal limitation across spatial scales. 2. Here, we measured 12 traits of 112 study species in a 20-ha fully mapped subtropical forest plot. The individuals of the 112 study species account for 99% of all living stems with diameter at breast height >= 1 cm. We studied important functional traits related to physiological processes of plants including resource acquisition (e.g. CO2 assimilation rate and leaf nutrient concentration) and drought tolerance (e.g. stem hydraulic conductivity and leaf turgor loss point). Additionally, species abundance, spatial locations (x-and y-coordinates for each individual of the 112 study species) as well as topographic and soil variables that represent potentially important attributes of the physical environment of the plot were also included in our dataset. 3. We employed two FD-based tests (comparing FD within communities to those from random communities, distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) and redundancy analysis-based variance partitioning), and one spatial analysis (inhomogeneous bivariate pair correlation analysis) to quantify the spatial patterns of FD of the plot at multiple spatial scales (400, 900, 1,600, 2,500 and 10,000 m(2)). 4. We demonstrate that abiotic filtering is the major determinant responsible for trait convergence at relatively small scales (400, 900 and 1,600 m(2)), whereas dispersal limitation becomes dominant, causing the weakening of trait convergence at relatively large scales (2,500 and 10,000 m(2)). 5.

These forests are characterized by decreasing light but increasing water availability during succession, and the fern communities correspondingly differ in species composition. We tested community assembly using functional trait distributions and found that habitat filtering and exclusion of weak competitive traits among coexisting species jointly explain fern shade tolerance as measured by photosynthetic capacity (PR), photosynthetic nutrient efficiency (PNUE and PPUE) and water use efficiency as measured by carbon isotope ratio (CIR), and constitute important determinants of fern community assembly in all three forests.

Analyses of beta diversity in a phylogenetic context could provide an excellent opportunity for testing many of these hypotheses. We analyzed the patterns of phylogenetic beta diversity in tropical tree communities in Panama to test several community assembly hypotheses. In particular, the degree to which the phylogenetic dissimilarity between communities can be explained by geographical or environmental distance can yield support for stochastic or deterministic assembly processes, respectively. Therefore, we examined: (i) the existence of distance decay of phylogenetic similarity among communities and its degree of departure from that expected under a null model; and (ii) the relative importance of geographical versus environmental distance in predicting the phylogenetic dissimilarity of communities. We found evidence that the similarity in the phylogenetic composition of communities decayed with geographical distance and environmental gradients. Null model evidence showed that beta diversity in the study system was phylogenetically non-random.

The Hun-Tai River Basin was extensively sampled four times for macroinvertebrate community and environmental variables during one year. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) were used to reveal the aggregation patterns of the 355 samples. Three community types (i.e., clusters) were found (at the family level) based on the community composition, which showed a clearly gradient by combining them with the representative environmental variables: minimally impacted source area, intermediately anthropogenic impacted sites, and highly anthropogenic impacted downstream area, respectively. This gradient was corroborated by the decreasing trends in density and diversity of macroinvertebrates. Distance from source, total phosphorus and water temperature were identified as the most important variables that distinguished the delineated communities. In addition, the sampling season, substrate type, pH and the percentage of grassland were also identified as relevant variables. These results demonstrated that macroinvertebrates communities are structured in a hierarchical manner where geographic and water quality prevail over temporal (season) and habitat (substrate type) features at the basin scale. In addition, it implied that the local-scale environment variables affected macroinvertebrates under the longitudinal gradient of the geographical and anthropogenic pressure. More than one family was identified as the indicator for each type of community. Abundance contributed significantly for distinguishing the indicators, while Baetidae with higher density indicated minimally and intermediately impacted area and lower density indicated highly impacted area. Therefore, we suggested the use of abundance data in community patterning and classification, especially in the identification of the indicator taxa. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It was confirmed by our study on spatial succession of both plant and arthropod communities along a linear transect of natural grassland. Both auto-correlation and cross-correlation analyses revealed that the succession of plant and arthropod communities exhibited a significant spatial correlation, and the spatial correlation for plant community succession was stronger than arthropod community succession. Theoretically it should be reasonable to infer a site's community composition from the last site in the linear transect.

An algorithm (i.e., Importance Detection Method (IDM)) for determining the relative importance of input variables was proposed. The relative importance for plant families Gramineae, Compositae and Leguminosae, and arthropod orders Homoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera, were detected and analyzed using IDM. ANNSSM performed better than multivariate linear regression and ordinary differential equation, while ordinary differential equation exhibited the worst performance in the simulation and prediction of spatial succession of biological communities. A state transition probability model (STPM) was proposed to simulate the state transition process of biological communities. STPM performed better than multinomial logistic regression in the state transition modeling. We suggested a novel multi-model framework, i.e., the joint use of ANNSSM and STPM, to predict the spatial succession of biological communities. In this framework, ANNSSM and STPM can be separately used to simulate the continuous and discrete dynamics.",10.1007/s10661-008-0574-1,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,

A key issue in invasion ecology has been how to quantify the contribution of species invasiveness and habitat invasibility separately. Conventional approaches, such as comparing the differences in traits and/or impacts of species between native and/or invaded ranges, do not determine the extent to which the performance of invaders is due to either the effects of species traits or habitat characteristics. Here we explore the interaction between two of the most widespread earthworm invaders in the world (Asian Amynthas agrestis and European Lumbricus rubellus) and study the effects of species invasiveness and habitat invasibility separately through an alternative approach of ""third habitat"" in Tennessee, USA. We propose that feeding behaviors of earthworms will be critical to invasion success because trophic ecology of invasive animals plays a key role in the invasion process. We found that (1) the biomass and isotopic abundances (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of A. agrestis were not impacted by either direct effects of L. rubellus competition or indirect effects of L. rubellus-preconditioned habitat; (2) A. agrestis disrupted the relationship between L. rubellus and soil microorganisms and consequently hindered litter consumption by L. rubellus; and (3) compared to L. rubellus, A. agrestis shifted its diet more readily to consume more litter, more soil gram-positive (G+) bacteria (which may be important for litter digestion), and more non-microbial soil fauna when soil microorganisms were depleted. In conclusion, A. agrestis showed strong invasiveness through its dietary flexibility through diet shifting and superior feeding behavior and its indirectly negative effect of habitat invasibility on L. rubellus via changes in the soil microorganism community. In such context, our results expand on the resource fluctuation hypothesis and support the superior competitor hypothesis.

The variability of traits, however, is often difficult to trace back in nature. Here, we analyzed stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen inmuscle samples of 88 S. chinensis stranded in the PRE from 2004 to 2016 to investigate the ecological changes occurring in the dolphins. Stable isotope analysis revealed the existence of two sub-aggregations of S. chinensis in the PRE. Generalized additive models showed significant decreasing trends in both carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures over time, indicating the habitat changes and dietary shifts, possibly due to the influence of increased coastal developments and fishing activities in the PRE. Diet modeling suggests that the proportional contribution of higher trophic-level prey decreased in the S. chinensis diet over time, while increased consumption of lower trophic-level prey was observed. This shift was related to depletion of higher trophic-level prey caused by overfishing. Although S. chinensis could temporarily compensate for the lost energy supply through feeding plasticity (revealed by the negligible differences of isotope niche width among different stranding periods), long-term depletion in prey availability may cause long-lasting negative effects on this dolphin population. This study highlights the crucial relationships between fishery management and dolphin conservation, providing scientific evidence for the long-termprotection of this threatened species in the PRE region.

Spatial factors (e.g., river connectivity, directionality, and man-made dams) may play a key role in influencing the metacommunity structure of rotifers because of their small body size and weak mobility. In contrast, local environmental factors (e.g., physicochemical habitat) may be more important to crustaceans due to their larger body size and stronger mobility. We sampled zooplankton and environmental factors during wet and dry seasons from 47 sites along the Ying River in China to assess the roles of the spatial and environmental factors in structuring zooplankton metacommunities. We used Moran's eigenvector map and asymmetric eigenvector map to model the influences of river connectivity, directionality, and man-made dams on zooplankton metacommunity structure. We then used partial redundancy analysis to identify individual and interactive effects of spatial and environmental factors on both the entire zooplankton assemblages and two zooplanlcton groups of different body sizes and mobility. A total of 101 taxa were identified and taxa richness was higher in the wet season (72) than in the dry season (58). Zooplankton assemblages were primarily dominated by rotifers. For the dry season, environmental factors such as total nitrogen, water temperature, and pH explained a significant portion of variation in zooplankton community; river connectivity was more important than river directionality to zooplankton metacommunity structure. For the wet season, spatial factors were more influential than environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen and water transparency; river directionality played an important role in influencing the spatial structures of both environmental condition and zooplankton metacommunity. We also found significant effects of man-made dams on zooplankton metacommunity structure. Spatial factors are more influential in structuring small body size and weak mobility rotifer communities, while environmental factors are more important in determining the variation of crustaceans due to their larger body size and stronger mobility. We concluded that river connectivity and directionality should be considered as key factors for better understanding the spatial processes of planktonic passive dispersers in river networks.

However, our understanding of the linkages between root chemical traits and community chemical diversity and assembly is still in its infancy. Environmental filtering and niche differentiation are two opposite driving forces of community assembly based on deterministic niche processes. We hypothesize that environmental filtering is a strong driver of root chemical assembly at a large spatial scale, whereas biogeochemical niche differentiation drives root chemical traits divergence among co-occurring species at site scale. We analysed the concentrations of 15 elements in the fine roots of 281 species across five forest types of China. Discriminant analysis was used to measure the degree of similarity of root chemical traits at the community level and biogeochemical niche differentiation at the species level. Root chemical traits at the community level showed a systematic shift along environmental gradients. The growth rate-related dimension represented by root P and Ca was the most important niche dimension associated with community root chemical assembly, driven by large-scale environmental filters, particularly soils and climate. Biogeochemical niche differentiation of co-occurring species could be a consequence of reducing nutrient competition, especially the competition for nitrogen.

Stable isotope analyses (C-13 and N-15) were also used to determine the association between individual trophic ecology and intraspecific functional trait variability. We observed that functional traits were highly variable within the population (mean coefficient variation: 15.62%+/- 1.78% SE) and predominantly different between age classes. In addition, functional and trophic niche overlap between age classes was extremely low. Differences in functional niche between age classes were associated with strong changes in trophic niche occurring during ontogeny while, within age classes, differences among individuals were likely driven by trophic specialization. Each age class filled only a small portion of the total functional niche of the population and age classes occupied distinct portions in the functional space, indicating the existence of ontogenetic specialists with different functional roles within the population.

These findings are consistent with predictions from trait-based analysis which predict that phytoplankton groups with high maximum growth rates (mu(max)) and high nutrient uptake rates (V-max) readily take advantage of the addition of limiting nutrients. Changes in phytoplankton community structure, if persistent, could trigger changes of particular organic matter fluxes and alter the micro-food web cycles and bottom oxygen consumption.",10.1371/journal.pone.0088732,N,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,,,,,Multiple,0,,,,,,,Multiple,,,,,0,,,
"Zhou, XL; Wang, YS; Zhang, PF; Guo, Z; Chu, CJ; Du, GZ",2016,The effects of fertilization on the trait-abundance relationships in a Tibetan alpine meadow community,JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,"Aims Comparisons of the trait-abundance relationships from various habitat types are critical for community ecology, which can offer us insights about the mechanisms underlying the local community assembly, such as the relative role of neutral vs. niche processes in shaping community structure. Here, we explored the responses of trait-abundance relationships to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilization in an alpine meadow. Methods Five fertilization treatments (an unfertilized control and additions of N, P, K and NPK respectively) were implemented using randomized block design in an alpine Tibetan meadow. Species relative abundance (SRA), plant above-ground biomass and species richness were measured in each plot. For 24 common species, we measured species functional traits: saturated height, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in each treatment but seed size only in the unfertilized control. Standard major axis (SMA) regression and phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) analysis were used to analyse species trait-abundance relationships in response to different fertilization treatments. Important Findings Positive correlations between SRA and saturated height were raised following N, P and NPK fertilizations, which indicated an increase in light competition in these plots. In P fertilized plots, SRA was also positively correlated with LDMC because tall grasses with a nutrients conservation strategy often have a relative competitive advantage in capturing limited light and soil nutrients. In K fertilized plots, neither the trait-abundance relationships nor above-ground biomass or species richness significantly differed from that in the control, which suggests that K was not a limiting resource in our study site. These significant correlations between species traits and relative abundance in fertilized treatment suggest that trait-based selection plays an important role in determining species abundance within local communities in alpine meadows.",10.1093/jpe/rtv043,Y,0,0,1,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Plants,Alpine,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = saturated height, specific leaf

Two foraging guilds are apparent: a specialist sit-and-wait (Agama impalearis, Tarentola mauritanica et Saurodactylus brosseti) and a generalist one (Eumeces algeriensis, Chalcides polylepis, Acanthodactylus erythrurus and Mesalina simoni). The studied lizard species differentiate from each other in substrate use relatively to their respective adaptive morphological traits. A. impalearis and T. mauritanica occur mainly in rocky areas, E. algeriensis and M. simoni appear mostly on rocky and pebbly-bare ground substrates, A. erythrurus and C. polylepis are found on sandy-pebbly substrates while S. brosseti occurs in pebbly soils. By contrast, there were large overlaps in the taxonomic composition of their diets which are numerically dominated by Formicidae, Isoptera, Coleoptera and Araneidae with different proportions according to lizard species. However, important prey-size differences between species allowed to reduce trophic overlap. A selectivity analysis of lizard diet revealed patterns of prey selection based on criteria inherent either to predator (foraging behaviour, morphological constraints) or prey (size, abundance and activity). Results suggest that spatial and trophic segregation along with taxonomic divergence make possible the coexistence of these lizard species.",unkown_32,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Herps,Alpine,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,traits = foraging guild,

Prey capture sequences, especially in invertebrates, are supposed to be quite invariant. In cuttlefish, the attack includes three components: attention, positioning, and seizure. The previous studies indicated some variability in these components and we quantified it under the hypothesis that it could relate to personality differences. We, therefore, analysed predation sequences of adult cuttlefish to test their association with personality traits in different contexts. Nineteen subjects were first exposed to an ""alert"" and a ""threat"" test and then given a live prey, for 10 days. Predation sequences were scored for components of the attack, locomotor and postural elements, body patterns, and number of successful tentacle ejections (i.e. seizure). PCA analysis of predatory patterns identified three dimensions accounting for 53.1%, 15.9%, and 9.6% of the variance and discriminating individuals based on ""speed in catching prey"", ""duration of attack behaviour"", and ""attention to prey"". Predation rate, success rate, and hunting time were significantly correlated with the first, second, and third PCA factors, respectively. Significant correlations between capture patterns and responsiveness in the alert and threat tests were found, highlighting a consistency of prey capture patterns with measures of personality in other contexts.

"Zorzal-Almeida, S; Soininen, J; Bini, LM; Bicudo, DC",2017,Local environment and connectivity are the main drivers of diatom species composition and trait variation in a set of tropical reservoirs,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. A metacommunity is defined as a set of local communities that are connected by dispersal and are controlled by environmental drivers operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Although diatom ecology has been studied extensively in temperate and lotic ecosystems, knowledge of tropical lentic systems is more limited. 2. We evaluated how planktonic and surface-sediment diatom communities, including trait-based communities, were structured by environmental, spatial and land-use variables in tropical reservoirs. Diatoms were sampled in seven reservoirs (31 sites in total) in south-east Brazil, from the surface sediment and the plankton in summer and winter. 3. Diatom communities responded primarily to a trophic gradient and secondarily to a light-availability gradient. Connectivity was also a strong predictor, whereas land use had a weaker influence on community variation. Our results further suggested that surface-sediment and planktonic diatom groups were structured by similar environmental variables. Trait-based analysis also indicated that these communities were related to environmental and spatial factors. 4. We conclude that (1) trophic state, light availability and connectivity were the main drivers of diatoms in this set of tropical reservoirs, resulting in spatially structured communities; (2) patterns for surface-sediment diatoms resembled both summer and winter diatom communities in the plankton; and (3) the effects of the explanatory variables (local environment, connectivity and land use) varied among the different biological datasets (i.e. when organised taxonomically, or according to growth morphology, cell size or trophic preference). We emphasize that studies in tropical reservoirs should take spatial variables into account, due to the connectivity of the sites.",10.1111/fwb.12966,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Plankton,River,0,1,0,0,1,Multiple,2,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = growth morphology, cell size and trophic‐status",
"Zu, JA; Mimura, M; Takeuchi, Y",2011,Adaptive evolution of foraging-related traits in a predator-prey community,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"In this paper, with the method of adaptive dynamics and geometric technique, we investigate the adaptive evolution of foraging-related phenotypic traits in a predator-prey community with trade-off structure. Specialization on one prey type is assumed to go at the expense of specialization on another. First, we identify the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching in predator phenotype. Generally, if there is a small switching cost near the singular strategy, then this singular strategy is an evolutionary branching point, in which predator population will change from monomorphism to dimorphism. Second, we find that if the trade-off curve is globally convex, predator population eventually branches into two extreme specialists, each completely specializing on a particular prey species. However, if the trade-off curve is concave-convex-concave, after branching in predator phenotype, the two predator species will evolve to an evolutionarily stable dimorphism at which they can continue to coexist. The analysis reveals that an attractive dimorphism will always be evolutionarily stable and that no further branching is possible under this model. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among the largest and most controversial of these projects is the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex being constructed on the Xingu River, a major Amazon tributary in Brazil. Despite the potentially large impacts, almost no baseline ecological data are available for the river's diverse ichthyofauna. This study uses ecomorphology and stable isotope analysis to explore the functional and trophic relationships among four of the dominant families within the Xingu River rapids (Loricariidae, Cichlidae, Anostomidae, and Serrasalmidae). Morphological analysis revealed clear separation of these families based on functional traits associated with microhabitat use and foraging strategies, with the Loricariidae and Cichlidae displaying greatest functional diversity. The four families analyzed were not clearly differentiated in isotopic space defined by delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Considerable overlap was observed among isotopic niches and all four families primarily assimilated material originating from phytomicrobenthos (assumed to be mainly benthic algae). Differences between morphological and trophic diversity within families provide insight into how this diverse assemblage may be partitioning niche space, which in turn has implications for population responses to hydrologic alteration.",10.1007/s10641-016-0506-9,Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,Single,Freshwater,Fish,River,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = standard length, snout length eye position, eye diameter, body depth, dorsal fin length, peduncle length, peduncle depth, dorsal fin height, anal fin length, anal fin ehight, caudal fin length, interorbital distance, body width, caudal penuncle width, head length and height, gape width, caudal fin depth, mouth position",

Effects of CWM and FDis individually support the biomass ratio hypothesis and the niche complementarity hypothesis. However, there is little empirical evidence on the relative roles of CVVM traits and FDis in explaining the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in grassland ecosystems. We measured plant functional traits in the 34 most abundant species across 24 sites along a restoration gradient of sandy grassland (mobile dune, semi-fixed dune, fixed dune, and grassland) in Horgin Sand Land, northern China. Thereafter, we calculated the CWM traits, the functional divergence of each single trait (FDvar) and the trait dispersion of multiple traits (FDis). We also measured the C and N storage in plant, litter, root, and soil. Using a stepwise multiple regression analysis, we further assessed which of the functional diversity components best explained C and N storage in the sandy grassland restoration. We found consistent links between C or N storage and leaf traits related to plant resource use strategy. However, the CWM of plant height was retained as an important predictor of C and N storage in plant, litter, soil, and total ecosystem in the final multiple models. CWMs of specific leaf area and plant height best predicted soil C and N storage and total ecosystem N storage. FDis was one of good predictors of litter C and N storage as well as total ecosystem C storage. These results suggest that ecosystem C and N pools in the sandy grassland restoration are primarily associated with the traits of the most abundant species in communities, thereby supporting the biomass ratio hypothesis. The positive associations of FDis with C storage in litter and total ecosystem provide evidence to support the niche complementarity hypothesis. Both functional traits of dominant species and traits' dispersion in plant communities could contribute to explaining total ecosystem C storage. Thus, single- and multi-trait indices of functional composition play a crucial role in predicting C storage in sandy grasslands.",10.3389/fpls.2016.00189,Y,0,1,0,0,1,0,Multiple,Terrestrial,Plants,Grassland,0,1,0,0,0,Single,1,1,0,0,,,0,Single,0,0,0,0,1,1,"traits = plant height,SLA,LDMC,leaf

"Zwolak, R",2018,How intraspecific variation in seed-dispersing animals matters for plants,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,"Seed dispersal by animals is a complex phenomenon, characterized by multiple mechanisms and variable outcomes. Most researchers approach this complexity by analysing context-dependency in seed dispersal and investigating extrinsic factors that might influence interactions between plants and seed dispersers. Intrinsic traits of seed dispersers provide an alternative way of making sense of the enormous variation in seed fates. I review causes of intraspecific variability in frugivorous and granivorous animals, discuss their effects on seed dispersal, and outline likely consequences for plant populations and communities. Sources of individual variation in seed-dispersing animals include sexual dimorphism, changes associated with growth and ageing, individual specialization, and animal personalities. Sexual dimorphism of seed-dispersing animals influences seed fate through diverse mechanisms that range from effects caused by sex-specific differences in body size, to influences of male versus female cognitive functions. These differences affect the type of seed treatment (e.g. dispersal versus predation), the number of dispersed seeds, distance of seed dispersal, and likelihood that seeds are left in favourable sites for seeds or seedlings. The best-documented consequences of individual differences associated with growth and ageing involve quantity of dispersed seeds and the quality of seed treatment in the mouth and gut. Individual specialization on different resources affects the number of dispersed plant species, and therefore the connectivity and architecture of seed-dispersal networks. Animal personalities might play an important role in shaping interactions between plants and dispersers of their seeds, yet their potential in this regard remains overlooked. In general, intraspecific variation in seed-dispersing animals often influences plants through effects of these individual differences on the movement ecology of the dispersers. Two conditions are necessary for individual variation to exert a strong influence on seed dispersal. First, the individual differences in traits should translate into differences in crucial characteristics of seed dispersal. Second, individual variation is more likely to be important when the proportions of particular types of individuals fluctuate strongly in a population or vary across space; when proportions are static, it is less likely that intraspecific differences will be responsible for changes in the dynamics and outcomes of plant-animal interactions. In conclusion, focusing on variation among foraging animals rather than on species averages might bring new, mechanistic insights to the phenomenon of seed dispersal. While this shift in perspective is unlikely to replace the traditional approach (based on the assumption that all important variation occurs among species), it provides a complementary alternative to decipher the enormous variation observed in animal-mediated seed dispersal.",10.1111/brv.12377,Y,1,0,0,0,0,0,Single,Terrestrial,Broad,Broad,0,0,0,0,1,Single,1,0,0,0,1,,1,Multiple,0,0,0,1,1,1,traits = seed dispersal.
