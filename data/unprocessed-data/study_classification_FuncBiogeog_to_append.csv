A global ocean atlas of eukaryotic genes,"While our knowledge about the roles of microbes and viruses in the ocean has increased tremendously due to recent advances in genomics and metagenomics, research on marine microbial eukaryotes and zooplankton has benefited much less from these new technologies because of their larger genomes, their enormous diversity, and largely unexplored physiologies. Here, we use a metatranscriptomics approach to capture expressed genes in open ocean Tara Oceans stations across four organismal size fractions. The individual sequence reads cluster into 116 million unigenes representing the largest reference collection of eukaryotic transcripts from any single biome. The catalog is used to unveil functions expressed by eukaryotic marine plankton, and to assess their functional biogeography. Almost half of the sequences have no similarity with known proteins, and a great number belong to new gene families with a restricted distribution in the ocean. Overall, the resource provides the foundations for exploring the roles of marine eukaryotes in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.",10.1038/s41467-017-02342-1,2018,J,"Carradec, Q; Pelletier, E; Da Silva, C; Alberti, A; Seeleuthner, Y; Blanc-Mathieu, R; Lima-Mendez, G; Rocha, F; Tirichine, L; Labadie, K; Kirilovsky, A; Bertrand, A; Engelen, S; Madoui, MA; Meheust, R; Poulain, J; Romac, S; Richter, DJ; Yoshikawa, G; Dimier, C; Kandels-Lewis, S; Picheral, M; Searson, S; Jaillon, O; Aury, JM; Karsenti, E; Sullivan, MB; Sunagawa, S; Bork, P; Not, F; Hingamp, P; Raes, J; Guidi, L; Ogata, H; de Vargas, C; Iudicone, D; Bowler, C; Wincker, P",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Note: approach to approximating and measuring community, but not linking traits to environmental filtering.

Community trait structure in phytoplankton: seasonal dynamics from a method for sparse trait data,"The distribution of functional traits in communities, and how trait distributions shift over time and space, is critical information for understanding community structure, the maintenance of diversity, and community effects on ecosystem function. It is often the case that traits tightly linked to ecological performance, such as physiological capacities, are laborious to measure and largely unknown for speciose communities; however, these traits are particularly important for unraveling the mechanistic basis of community structure. Here I develop a method combining sparse trait data with a statistical niche model to infer trait distributions for phytoplankton communities and how they vary over 10 yr in the western English Channel. I find that community-average nitrate affinity, light-limited growth rate, and maximum growth rate all show major seasonal patterns, reflecting alternate limitation by light vs. nitrogen. Trait diversity exhibits a variety of patterns distinct from community trait means, which suggests complex regulation of functional diversity. Patterns such as these are important for predicting how ocean ecosystems will respond to global change, and for developing trait-based models of emergent community structure. The statistical approach used here could be applied to any kind of organism, if it exhibits strong relationships between traits and statistical niche estimates.",10.1002/ecy.1581,2016,J,"Edwards, KF",ECOLOGY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,marine,phytoplankton,temperate Eastern Atlantic Ocean,specific nitrate affinity; light?limited growth ability; maximum growth rate,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
"Australian Tropical and Subtropical Rain Forest Community Assembly: Phylogeny, Functional Biogeography, and Environmental Gradients","To compare community assemblage patterns in tropical northeastern and subtropical central eastern Australia across selected gradients and scales, we tested the relationship of species traits with phylogenetic structure, and niche breadth. We considered phylogenetic relationships across current-day species in assemblages in relation to rain forest species pool sizes, and trait values along gradients including elevation and latitude. Trait values were quantified across scales for seed size, leaf area, wood density and maximum height at maturity for 1137 species and 596 assemblages using trait gradient analysis (TGA). Local assemblages of subtropical species had narrower trait ranges, and higher niche breadth values than corresponding assemblages of tropical species. Leaf size and seed size increased at low latitudes, and community phylogenetic structure was most strongly correlated with seed traits in the subtropics, reflecting dispersal and re-colonization processes. Elevation accounted for little of the variance in community phylogenetic structure or trait variation across local and regional scales. Stable moist forest areas retained many species from ancestral rain forest lineages across a range of temporally conserved habitats; species within assemblages were less related; and rain forest assemblages had higher functional diversity, but lower niche breadth. This suggests that on average, assemblages of species in stable areas had greater trait variation and narrower distributions. Historic and recent rain forest contraction and re-expansion can result in recolonized areas that are dominated by species that are more related (phylogenetically) than by chance, have smaller, widely dispersed seeds, and greater niche breadth (broader distributions).",10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00861.x,2012,J,"Kooyman, R; Rossetto, M; Allen, C; Cornwell, W",BIOTROPICA,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CB
BHPMF-a hierarchical Bayesian approach to gap-filling and trait prediction for macroecology and functional biogeography,"Aim Functional traits of organisms are key to understanding and predicting biodiversity and ecological change, which motivates continuous collection of traits and their integration into global databases. Such trait matrices are inherently sparse, severely limiting their usefulness for further analyses. On the other hand, traits are characterized by the phylogenetic trait signal, trait-trait correlations and environmental constraints, all of which provide information that could be used to statistically fill gaps. We propose the application of probabilistic models which, for the first time, utilize all three characteristics to fill gaps in trait databases and predict trait values at larger spatial scales. Innovation For this purpose we introduce BHPMF, a hierarchical Bayesian extension of probabilistic matrix factorization ( PMF). PMF is a machine learning technique which exploits the correlation structure of sparse matrices to impute missing entries. BHPMF additionally utilizes the taxonomic hierarchy for trait prediction and provides uncertainty estimates for each imputation. In combination with multiple regression against environmental information, BHPMF allows for extrapolation from point measurements to larger spatial scales. We demonstrate the applicability of BHPMF in ecological contexts, using different plant functional trait datasets, also comparing results to taking the species mean and PMF. Main conclusions Sensitivity analyses validate the robustness and accuracy of BHPMF: our method captures the correlation structure of the trait matrix as well as the phylogenetic trait signal-also for extremely sparse trait matrices-and provides a robust measure of confidence in prediction accuracy for each missing entry. The combination of BHPMF with environmental constraints provides a promising concept to extrapolate traits beyond sampled regions, accounting for intraspecific trait variability. We conclude that BHPMF and its derivatives have a high potential to support future trait-based research in macroecology and functional biogeography.",10.1111/geb.12335,2015,J,"Schrodt, F; Kattge, J; Shan, HH; Fazayeli, F; Joswig, J; Banerjee, A; Reichstein, M; Bonisch, G; Diaz, S; Dickie, J; Gillison, A; Karpatne, A; Lavorel, S; Leadley, P; Wirth, CB; Wright, IJ; Wright, SJ; Reich, PB",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Note: methods paper,COLE: Agree with this not relevant classification,CB
Geographical Patterns of Functional Diversity of South American Anurans,"A critical step in designing efficient spatial prioritization plans is to find the best network of sites that preserve multiple biodiversity facets. Conservation biogeography has increasingly been using functional diversity (FD) as an alternative metric to describe how trait diversity is distributed throughout space. FD can be promptly related to the function played by species in a community, better than taxonomic diversity. Here, we mapped multiple dimensions of functional diversity of South American anurans that describe functional richness (FRich), evenness (FEve), dispersion (FDis), and rarity (Frar) at the regional scale, as well as geographical restrictiveness and body size. FRich was higher in the Amazon basin, Guianas, Tropical Andes, and the central portion of the Atlantic Forest, whereas lower values appear in Patagonia and the Atacama Desert. FEve and FDis were homogeneously distributed throughout the continent, with lowest values in southern Patagonia, Pacific slope of the southern Tropical Andes, and Atacama Desert, while the highest values were found in the Atlantic slope of the southern Tropical Andes. Patterns of functional distinctiveness and uniqueness were similar and highlighted northwestern Argentina and areas with many endemic and functionally unique species.

Scaling from Traits to Ecosystems: Developing a General Trait Driver Theory via Integrating Trait-Based and Metabolic Scaling Theories,"Aim: More powerful tests of biodiversity theories need to move beyond species richness and explicitly focus on mechanisms generating diversity via trait composition. The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However, a general theory of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature), has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory, it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term 'Trait Driver Theory' or TDT. It shows that the shape and dynamics of trait and size distributions can be linked to fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several theoretical studies and recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences ecosystem processes across an elevational gradient and a 140-year-long ecological experiment. We show that TDT provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then 'scale up' to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, TDT offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change.",10.1016/bs.aecr.2015.02.001,2015,S,"Enquist, BJ; Norberg, J; Bonser, SP; Violle, C; Webb, CT; Henderson, A; Sloat, LL; Savage, VM","ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH, VOL 52: TRAIT-BASED ECOLOGY - FROM STRUCTURE TO FUNCTION",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,"Co, USA; sagebrush scrub and alpine forest",SLA,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Conservation assessment of the Peruvian Andes and Amazon based on mapped forest functional diversity,"Ongoing tropical deforestation and forest degradation, combined with climate change, call for improved forest functional and biological diversity mapping to support increasingly tactical decision-making for conservation action. We combine a new map of forest canopy functional and biological composition with extensive protected area and indigenous land allocation data to quantify current protections and opportunities for new protections throughout the Peruvian Andes and Amazon region, a global biodiversity hotspot. The analysis is based on a map of 36 distinct Forest Functional Classes (FFC) covering > 76 million ha of forest at 1-ha spatial resolution. We find that while 42.6% of forests are under some form of protection, the percentage of protections applied to any particular FFC ranges from 20% to 69%. Under-represented FFCs are in the submontane and montane Andes, and in the northwestern Amazonian lowlands. Nationally-administered protections are uneven across the 36 FFCs, and regionally- and locally-administered protections are biased to relatively few mapped forest classes. Indigenous lands contain a relatively even distribution of FFC protections, providing the most FFC protection per unit forest area in Peru. Without the current portfolio of indigenous lands, the network of nationally-, regionally-, and locally-administered protected areas would greatly under-represent multiple functionally and biologically distinct FFCs throughout Peru. Mapping canopy functional diversity can support tactical approaches to protect a wider variety of forest types in a time of rapid environmental change.",10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.008,2017,J,"Asner, GP; Martin, RE; Tupayachi, R; Llactayo, W",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,tropical forests globally,foliar N; foliar water; leaf mass per unit area; foliar defense compounds; foliar P; foliar CA,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Common latitudinal gradients in functional richness and functional evenness across marine and terrestrial systems,"Functional diversity s an important aspect of biodiversity, but its relationship to species diversity in time and space is poorly understood. Here we compare spatial patterns of functional and taxonomic diversity across marine and terrestrial system, to identify commonalities in their respective ecological and evolutionary drivers. We placed species-level ecological traits into comparable multi-dimensional frameworks for two model systems, marine bivalves and terrestrial birds, and used global species-occurrence data to examine the distribution of functional diversity with latitude and longitude. In both systems, tropical faunas show high total functional richness (FR) but low functional evenness (FE) (i.e. the tropics contain a highly skewed distribution of species among functional groups). Functional groups that persist toward the poles become more uniform in species richness, such that FR declines and FE rises with latitude in both systems. Temperate assemblages are more functionally even than tropical assemblages subsampled to temperate levels of species richness, suggesting that high species richness in the tropics reflects a high degree of ecological specialisation within a few functional groups and /or factors that favour high recent speciation or reduced extinction rates in those groups.",10.1098/rspb.2019.0745,2019,J,"Schumm, M; Edie, SM; Collins, KS; Gomez-Bahamon, V; Supriya, K; White, AE; Price, TD; Jablonski, D",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Note: patterns of evenness and richness in FD, rather than trait-based relationships with filtering","COLE: agree, they use traits, but then create their functional groups from those traits which I don't think is in line with our premise of traits individually AND as groups being filtered",CB

Large-scale biogeographical patterns of bacterial antibiotic resistome in the waterbodies of China,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are widespread in aquatic environments, but we know little about their biogeographical distribution and occurrence at national scales. Here we analyzed the patterns of ARGs from 42 natural waterbodies (natural lakes and reservoirs) across China using high-throughput approaches. The major ARGs were multidrug genes and the main resistance mechanism was the efflux pump. Although the absolute abundance of ARGs (gene copies/L) in the south/central waterbodies was similar to the northern waterbodies, the normalized abundance of ARGs (ARGs/16S rRNA gene copy number) was higher in the south/central waterbodies than in the north (mainly because of the aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes). Human activities strongly correlated with the normalized abundance of ARGs. The composition of ARGs in the waterbodies of south/central China was different from that in the north, and ARGs showed a distance-decay relationship. Anthropogenic factors had the most significant effects on this spatial distribution of ARG composition, followed by the spatial, bacterial and physicochemical factors. These indicate that the ARGs exhibited biogeographical patterns and that multiple ecological mechanisms - such as environmental selection (human activities and local physicochemical parameters) and dispersal limitation - influence distribution of ARGs in these waters. In general, our results provide a valuable ecological insight to explain the large-scale dispersal patterns in ARGs, thereby having potential applications for both public health and environmental management.",10.1016/j.envint.2018.05.023,2018,J,"Liu, LM; Su, JQ; Guo, YY; Wilkinson, DM; Liu, ZW; Zhu, YG; Yang, J",ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,bacteria,multiple (lake and reservoir),antibiotic resistant genes,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Functional-biogeography of the reef fishes of the islands of the Gulf of California: Integrating functional divergence into marine conservation,"The Gulf of California (GC) is a semi-closed sea in the Tropical Eastern Pacific and is recognised as a highly diverse marine ecosystem. Despite this status, this region is still poorly studied in comparison to other marine hotspots. To start filling this gap, we attempt to provide a global overview of reef-fish diversity around the numerous islands of the region. We evaluated species richness, the abundance and biomass, and the functional diversity of the fish assemblages for the major islands of the GC. We first highlight that the southwestern part of the central GC is the hotspot of reef-fishes diversity within the GC, in terms of species richness, functional diversity, and fish abundance. We then found out an important functional divergence between fish assemblages of northern and southern regions. The fish biomass of each region is dominated by different species, characterised by different ecological traits (the opposite of functional convergence). This functional divergence may be explained by an important oceanographic heterogeneity along the latitudinal axis of the GC. The northern part shows larger climate fluctuations while the southern part is more tropical and climatically stable. Such functional divergence is a biodiversity facet to take into account when determining the sites to focus conservation action. In the GC, this criterion allows the importance of some sites to be highlighted to preserve the legacy of the reef-fishes, despite their lower diversity levels. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Functional biogeography: Stoichiometry and thresholds for interpreting nutrient limitation in aquatic plants,"Atmospheric N pollution may shift nutrient limitations in aquatic autotrophs from N to P or cause an intensification of P limitation in formerly pristine areas. Small changes in nutrient supply in oligotrophic lakes and rivers could lead to large changes in relative plant growth and yield with possible knock on effects on ecosystem carbon cycling through changes in the decomposition rate of their tissue. Previous biogeographical studies have shown inconsistent responses of plant nutrient tissue content and stoichiometry (functional traits) to external nutrient availability. Here we used a single species, Juncus bulbosus, to test the interplay between plant tissue nutrient (content and stoichiornetry) and external environmental factors (local and catchment scale). We developed a comparative approach applicable globally to assess the thresholds for nutrient limitation in aquatic plants in the wild. Phosphorus in Juncus bulbosus tissue was negatively related to sediment organic matter (Fe root plaque limiting P uptake) and catchment vegetation cover (less P leaching to lakes). Our comparative approach revealed that the lack of increase in N plant tissue along the strong gradient in external N concentration may be explained by P limitation and strict plant tissue N:P ratio. Our comparative approach further showed that the nutrient content and stoichiometry ofJuncus bulbosus was similar to other submerged aquatic plants growing in nutrient poor aquatic ecosystems. In southern Norway, mass development of Juncus bulbosus may be primarily triggered by changes in P availability, rather than CO2 or inorganic N, as previously thought, although co-limitations are also possible. If so, the mass development of Juncus bulbosus in oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems could be an early indicator of increasing P fluxes through these ecosystems which are less limited by N due to high atmospheric N deposition.

Latitudinal variation of leaf stomatal traits from species to community level in forests: linkage with ecosystem productivity,"To explore the latitudinal variation of stomatal traits from species to community level and their linkage with net primary productivity (NPP), we investigated leaf stomatal density (SDL) and stomatal length (SLL) across 760 species from nine forest ecosystems in eastern China, and calculated the community-level SD (SDC) and SL (SLC) through species-specific leaf area index (LAI). Our results showed that latitudinal variation in species-level SDL and SLL was minimal, but community-level SDC and SLC decreased clearly with increasing latitude. The relationship between SD and SL was negative across species and different plant functional types (PFTs), but positive at the community level. Furthermore, community-level SDC correlated positively with forest NPP, and explained 51% of the variation in NPP. These findings indicate that the trade-off by regulating SDL and SLL may be an important strategy for plant individuals to adapt to environmental changes, and temperature acts as the main factor influencing community-level stomatal traits through alteration of species composition. Importantly, our findings provide new insight into the relationship between plant traits and ecosystem function.",10.1038/srep14454,2015,J,"Wang, RL; Yu, GR; He, NP; Wang, QF; Zhao, N; Xu, ZW; Ge, JP",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,forests across China,leaf stomatal density; leaf stomatal length,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,COLE: recommend removing short forms from traits,CB
Functional biogeography of oceanic islands and the scaling of functional diversity in the Azores,"Analyses of species-diversity patterns of remote islands have been crucial to the development of biogeographic theory, yet little is known about corresponding patterns in functional traits on islands and how, for example, they may be affected by the introduction of exotic species. We collated trait data for spiders and beetles and used a functional diversity index (FRic) to test for nonrandomness in the contribution of endemic, other native (also combined as indigenous), and exotic species to functional-trait space across the nine islands of the Azores. In general, for both taxa and for each distributional category, functional diversity increases with species richness, which, in turn scales with island area. Null simulations support the hypothesis that each distributional group contributes to functional diversity in proportion to their species richness. Exotic spiders have added novel trait space to a greater degree than have exotic beetles, likely indicating greater impact of the reduction of immigration filters and/or differential historical losses of indigenous species. Analyses of species occurring in native-forest remnants provide limited indications of the operation of habitat filtering of exotics for three islands, but only for beetles. Although the general linear (not saturating) pattern of trait-space increase with richness of exotics suggests an ongoing process of functional enrichment and accommodation, further work is urgently needed to determine how estimates of extinction debt of indigenous species should be adjusted in the light of these findings.",10.1073/pnas.1218036111,2014,J,"Whittaker, RJ; Rigal, F; Borges, PAV; Cardoso, P; Terzopoulou, S; Casanoves, F; Pla, L; Guilhaumon, F; Ladle, RJ; Triantis, KA",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,invertebrates,oceanic islands (Azores),body size; web use; web architecture; foraging strategy; prey range; vertical stratification; period of activity; feeding guild; wing morphology,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,invasion,,COLE here a trait used is 'circadian activity' but 'period of activity' is used below - would pick one of those as I think they probably mean the same thing,CB
Predicting species' range limits from functional traits for the tree flora of North America,"Using functional traits to explain species' range limits is a promising approach in functional biogeography. It replaces the idiosyncrasy of species-specific climate ranges with a generic trait-based predictive framework. In addition, it has the potential to shed light on specific filter mechanisms creating large-scale vegetation patterns. However, its application to a continental flora, spanning large climate gradients, has been hampered by a lack of trait data. Here, we explore whether five key plant functional traits (seed mass, wood density, specific leaf area (SLA), maximum height, and longevity of a tree)-indicative of life history, mechanical, and physiological adaptations-explain the climate ranges of 250 North American tree species distributed from the boreal to the subtropics. Although the relationship between traits and the median climate across a species range is weak, quantile regressions revealed strong effects on range limits. Wood density and seed mass were strongly related to the lower but not upper temperature range limits of species. Maximum height affects the species range limits in both dry and humid climates, whereas SLA and longevity do not show clear relationships. These results allow the definition and delineation of climatic ""no-go areas"" for North American tree species based on key traits. As some of these key traits serve as important parameters in recent vegetation models, the implementation of trait-based climatic constraints has the potential to predict both range shifts and ecosystem consequences on a more functional basis. Moreover, for future trait-based vegetation models our results provide a benchmark for model evaluation.",10.1073/pnas.1300673111,2014,J,"Stahl, U; Reu, B; Wirth, C",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,North American forests,seed mass; wood density; SLA; maximum height; longevity,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,climate change,,,CB
"Forest canopy height co-determines taxonomic and functional richness, but not functional dispersion of mammals and birds globally","Aims Taller forest canopies may harbour higher biodiversity by providing more and varied resources. No previous studies have assessed whether forest canopy height shapes the taxonomic and functional diversity of terrestrial vertebrates at global and regional scales. Here, we examine the roles of forest canopy height and other environmental variables in shaping global and regional patterns of species richness and functional diversity of mammals and birds. Location Global. Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Terrestrial mammals and birds. Methods Global forest canopy height data at 1 km spatial resolution were used to measure forest vertical structure. Species richness, functional richness and functional dispersion of mammals and birds were calculated using range maps and trait data. Spatial simultaneous autoregressive error models were used to evaluate associations between species richness and functional diversity and their predictors, including mean canopy height, standard deviation of canopy height, net primary productivity, current climate and historical climate stability, topography and human activities. Results The mean canopy height emerged as one of two predictors most associated with the species richness and functional richness of mammal. However, mean canopy height had little explanatory power for functional dispersion. Mean annual temperature and net primary productivity contributed most to explain global-scale mammal and bird functional dispersion. At the regional scale, mean canopy height, net primary productivity and mean annual temperature were the variables most associated with the species richness and functional diversity of mammals and birds. Main conclusions Forest canopy height is an important predictor of species richness and functional diversity of terrestrial vertebrates at both global and regional scales, at a similar overall level to productivity and temperature.

Global biogeography of microbial nitrogen-cycling traits in soil,"Microorganisms drive much of the Earth's nitrogen (N) cycle, but we still lack a global overview of the abundance and composition of the microorganisms carrying out soil N processes. To address this gap, we characterized the biogeography of microbial N traits, defined as eight N-cycling pathways, using publically available soil metagenomes. The relative frequency of N pathways varied consistently across soils, such that the frequencies of the individual N pathways were positively correlated across the soil samples. Habitat type, soil carbon, and soil N largely explained the total N pathway frequency in a sample. In contrast, we could not identify major drivers of the taxonomic composition of the N functional groups. Further, the dominant genera encoding a pathway were generally similar among habitat types. The soil samples also revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of bacteria carrying the pathways required for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, a little-studied N process in soil. Finally, phylogenetic analysis showed that some microbial groups seem to be N-cycling specialists or generalists. For instance, taxa within the Deltaproteo bacteria encoded all eight N pathways, whereas those within the Cyanobacteria primarily encoded three pathways. Overall, this trait-based approach provides a baseline for investigating the relationship between microbial diversity and N cycling across global soils.",10.1073/pnas.1601070113,2016,J,"Nelson, MB; Martiny, AC; Martiny, JBH",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,bacteria,soil microbes globablly,nitrification; N fixation; denitrification; dissimilatory nitrate to nitrite reduction; dissimilatory nitrite to ammonia reduction; assimilatory nitrate to nitrite reduction; assimilatory nitrite to ammonia reduction; ammonia assimilation,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Additional review: global biogeographic patterns, but no environmental drivers assessed","COLE: agree with the classification, I think the habitat type, soil C etc, could be viewed as 'environmental variables' through which there is filering for the the nitrogen traits",CB
Functional biogeography and host specificity of bacterial communities associated with the Marine Green Alga Ulva spp.,"Bacterial communities play an essential role for the function of marine macroalgae. Recent work has shown that bacterial communities associated with individual macroalgae possess on a local scale a functional core that is likely derived from diverse members of functional guilds. It is not known whether such functional cores also exist across large spatial scales or between closely related host species. To address this, we studied here the bacterial communities on three species of the green macroalgal genus Ulva from different geographic locations. While the taxonomic composition was too variable to describe a community core, we identified genes that were enriched across all Ulva samples as compared to the communities of the surrounding seawater. Of these core functions, 70% were consistently found and independent of the Ulva species and biogeography, while the remaining functions (similar to 30%) are possibly involved in local or host-specific adaptations.

Large-scale climatic and geophysical controls on the leaf economics spectrum,"Leaf economics spectrum (LES) theory suggests a universal trade-off between resource acquisition and storage strategies in plants, expressed in relationships between foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthesis. However, how environmental conditions mediate LES trait interrelationships, particularly at large biospheric scales, remains unknown because of a lack of spatially explicit data, which ultimately limits our understanding of ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and biogeochemical cycles. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and geospatial modeling to generate, to our knowledge, the first biospheric maps of LES traits, here centered on 76 million ha of Andean and Amazonian forest, to assess climatic and geophysical determinants of LES traits and their interrelationships. Elevation and substrate were codominant drivers of leaf trait distributions. Multiple additional climatic and geophysical factors were secondary determinants of plant traits. Anticorrelations between N and LMA followed general LES theory, but topo-edaphic conditions strongly mediated and, at times, eliminated this classic relationship. We found no evidence for simple P-LMA or N-P trade-offs in forest canopies; rather, we mapped a continuum of N-P-LMA interactions that are sensitive to elevation and temperature. Our results reveal nested climatic and geophysical filtering of LES traits and their interrelationships, with important implications for predictions of forest productivity and acclimation to rapid climate change.",10.1073/pnas.1604863113,2016,J,"Asner, GP; Knapp, DE; Anderson, CB; Martin, RE; Vaughn, N",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,tropical forests,N; P; leaf mass per area,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,climate change,,COLE: recommend removing short forms from traits,CB
Climate-driven changes in functional biogeography of Arctic marine fish communities,"Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.",10.1073/pnas.1706080114,2017,J,"Frainer, A; Primicerio, R; Kortsch, S; Aune, M; Dolgov, AV; Fossheim, M; Aschan, MM",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,marine,fish,Arctic Ocean,feeding ecology; water column position; salinity; temperature; depth; body length; fecundity; longevity; egg size; age at maturity; length at maturity; growth rate; number of prey types; number of predators; omnivory,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,climate change,Note: qualitiative predictions,,CB
Functional Biogeography of Ocean Microbes Revealed through Non-Negative Matrix Factorization,"The direct ""metagenomic'' sequencing of genomic material from complex assemblages of bacteria, archaea, viruses and microeukaryotes has yielded new insights into the structure of microbial communities. For example, analysis of metagenomic data has revealed the existence of previously unknown microbial taxa whose spatial distributions are limited by environmental conditions, ecological competition, and dispersal mechanisms. However, differences in genotypes that might lead biologists to designate two microbes as taxonomically distinct need not necessarily imply differences in ecological function. Hence, there is a growing need for large-scale analysis of the distribution of microbial function across habitats. Here, we present a framework for investigating the biogeography of microbial function by analyzing the distribution of protein families inferred from environmental sequence data across a global collection of sites. We map over 6,000,000 protein sequences from unassembled reads from the Global Ocean Survey dataset to 8214 protein families, generating a protein family relative abundance matrix that describes the distribution of each protein family across sites. We then use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to approximate these protein family profiles as linear combinations of a small number of ecological components. Each component has a characteristic functional profile and site profile. Our approach identifies common functional signatures within several of the components. We use our method as a filter to estimate functional distance between sites, and find that an NMF-filtered measure of functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than a comparable PCA-filtered measure. We also find that functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than with geographic distance, in agreement with prior studies. We identify similar protein functions in several components and suggest that functional co-occurrence across metagenomic samples could lead to future methods for de-novo functional prediction. We conclude by discussing how NMF, and other dimension reduction methods, can help enable a macroscopic functional description of marine ecosystems.",10.1371/journal.pone.0043866,2012,J,"Jiang, XP; Langille, MGI; Neches, RY; Elliot, M; Levin, SA; Eisen, JA; Weitz, JS; Dushoff, J",PLOS ONE,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CB
A trait-based understanding of wood decomposition by fungi,"As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27% of the in situ variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history tradeoff that was previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediatedwood decomposition rates.",10.1073/pnas.1909166117,2020,J,"Lustenhouwer, N; Maynard, DS; Bradford, MA; Lindner, DL; Oberle, B; Zanne, AE; Crowther, TW",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,fungi,North American forests,decomposition rate; temperature niche minimum; temperature niche maximum; optimal temperature; temperature niche width; moisture niche minimum; moisture niche maximum; optimal moisture; moisture niche width; competitive ranking; offensive ability; defensive ability; extension rate; hyphal density; beta-glucosidase; cellulase; acid phosphatase; chitinase; leucine aminopeptidase; phenol oxidase II; peroxidase; pheno oxidase I,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Geographic scale and disturbance influence intraspecific trait variability in leaves and roots of North American understorey plants,"Considering intraspecific trait variability (ITV) in ecological studies has improved our understanding of species persistence and coexistence. These advances are based on the growing number of leaf ITV studies over local gradients, but logistical constraints have prevented a solid examination of ITV in root traits or at scales reflecting species' geographic ranges. We compared the magnitude of ITV in above- and below-ground plant organs across three spatial scales (biophysical region, locality and plot). We focused on six understorey species (four herbs and two shrubs) that occur both in disturbed and undisturbed habitats across boreal and temperate Canadian forests. We aimed to document ITV structure over broad ecological and geographical scales by asking: (a) What is the breadth of ITV across species range-scale? (b) What proportion of ITV is captured at different spatial scales, particularly when local scale disturbances are considered? and (c) Is the variance structure consistent between analogous leaf and root traits, and between morphological and chemical traits? Following standardized methods, we sampled 818 populations across 79 forest plots simultaneously, including disturbed and undisturbed stands, spanning four biophysical regions (similar to 5,200 km). Traits measured included specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL) and leaf and root nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Mg, Ca). We used variance decomposition techniques to characterize ITV structure across scales. Our results show that an important proportion of ITV occurred at the local scale when sampling included contrasting environmental conditions resulting from local disturbance. A certain proportion of the variability in both leaf and root traits remained unaccounted for by the three sampling scales included in the design (36% on average), with the largest amount for SRL (54%). Substantial differences in magnitude of ITV were found among the six species, and between analogous traits, suggesting that trait distribution was influenced by species strategy and reflects the extent of understorey environment heterogeneity. Even for species with broad geographical distributions, a large proportion of within-species trait variability can be captured by sampling locally across ecological gradients. This has practical implications for sampling design and trait selection for both local studies and continental-scale modelling.

Testing the environmental filtering concept in global drylands,"1. The environmental filtering hypothesis predicts that the abiotic environment selects species with similar trait values within communities. Testing this hypothesis along multiple -and interacting gradients of climate and soil variables constitutes a great opportunity to better understand and predict the responses of plant communities to ongoing environmental changes. 2. Based on two key plant traits, maximum plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), we assessed the filtering effects of climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality), soil characteristics (soil pH, sand content and total phosphorus) and all potential interactions on the functional structure and diversity of 124 dryland communities spread over the globe. The functional structure and diversity of dryland communities were quantified using the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of plant trait distributions. 3. The models accurately explained the observed variations in functional trait diversity across the 124 communities studied. All models included interactions among factors, i.e. climate-climate (9% of explanatory power), climate-soil (24% of explanatory power) and soil-soil interactions (5% of explanatory power). Precipitation seasonality was the main driver of maximum plant height, and interacted with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Soil pH mediated the filtering effects of climate and sand content on SLA. Our results also revealed that communities characterized by a low variance can also exhibit low kurtosis values, indicating that functionally contrasting species can co-occur even in communities with narrow ranges of trait values. 4. Synthesis. We identified the particular set of conditions under which the environmental filtering hypothesis operates in drylands world-wide. Our findings also indicate that species with functionally contrasting strategies can still co-occur locally, even under prevailing environmental filtering. Interactions between sources of environmental stress should be therefore included in global trait-based studies, as this will help to further anticipate where the effects of environmental filtering will impact plant trait diversity under climate change.",10.1111/1365-2745.12735,2017,J,"Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Y; Gross, N; Maestre, FT; Maire, V; de Bello, F; Fonseca, CR; Kattge, J; Valencia, E; Leps, J; Liancourt, P",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,dryland plants globally,SLA; maximum plant height,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Global Change Multiple,,,CB
"Climate, soil and plant functional types as drivers of global fine-root trait variation","1. Ecosystem functioning relies heavily on below-ground processes, which are largely regulated by plant fine-roots and their functional traits. However, our knowledge of fine-root trait distribution relies to date on local-and regional-scale studies with limited numbers of species, growth forms and environmental variation. 2. We compiled a world-wide fine-root trait dataset, featuring 1115 species from contrasting climatic areas, phylogeny and growth forms to test a series of hypotheses pertaining to the influence of plant functional types, soil and climate variables, and the degree of manipulation of plant growing conditions on species fine-root trait variation. Most particularly, we tested the competing hypotheses that fine-root traits typical of faster return on investment would be most strongly associated with conditions of limiting versus favourable soil resource availability. We accounted for both data source and species phylogenetic relatedness. 3. We demonstrate that: (i) Climate conditions promoting soil fertility relate negatively to fine-root traits favouring fast soil resource acquisition, with a particularly strong positive effect of temperature on fine-root diameter and negative effect on specific root length (SRL), and a negative effect of rainfall on root nitrogen concentration; (ii) Soil bulk density strongly influences species fine-root morphology, by favouring thicker, denser fine-roots; (iii) Fine-roots from herbaceous species are on average finer and have higher SRL than those of woody species, and N-2-fixing capacity positively relates to root nitrogen; and (iv) Plants growing in pots have higher SRL than those grown in the field. 4. Synthesis. This study reveals both the large variation in fine-root traits encountered globally and the relevance of several key plant functional types and soil and climate variables for explaining a substantial part of this variation. Climate, particularly temperature, and plant functional types were the two strongest predictors of fine-root trait variation. High trait variation occurred at local scales, suggesting that wide-ranging below-ground resource economics strategies are viable within most climatic areas and soil conditions.",10.1111/1365-2745.12769,2017,J,"Freschet, GT; Valverde-Barrantes, OJ; Tucker, CM; Craine, JM; McCormack, ML; Violle, C; Fort, F; Blackwood, CB; Urban-Mead, KR; Iversen, CM; Bonis, A; Comas, LH; Cornelissen, JHC; Dong, M; Guo, DL; Hobbie, SE; Holdaway, RJ; Kembel, SW; Makita, N; Onipchenko, VG; Picon-Cochard, C; Reich, PB; de la Riva, EG; Smith, SW; Soudzilovskaia, NA; Tjoelker, MG; Wardle, DA; Roumet, C",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,global,fine-root N concentration; mean diameter; tissue density; specific root length,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
funrar: An R package to characterize functional rarity,"Emphasis has been put in recent ecological research on investigating phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic facets of biological diversity. While a flourishing number of indices have been proposed for assessing functional diversity, surprisingly few options are available to characterize functional rarity. Functional rarity can play a key role in community and ecosystem dynamics. We introduce here the funrar R package to quantify functional rarity based on species trait differences and species frequencies at local and regional scales. Because of the increasing availability of big datasets in macroecology and biogeography, we optimized funrar to work with large datasets of thousands of species and sites. We illustrate the use of the package to investigate the functional rarity of North and Central American mammals.",10.1111/ddi.12629,2017,J,"Grenie, M; Denelle, P; Tucker, CM; Munoz, F; Violle, C",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CB
Gap-filling a spatially explicit plant trait database: comparing imputation methods and different levels of environmental information,"The ubiquity of missing data in plant trait databases may hinder trait-based analyses of ecological patterns and processes. Spatially explicit datasets with information on intraspecific trait variability are rare but offer great promise in improving our understanding of functional biogeography. At the same time, they offer specific challenges in terms of data imputation. Here we compare statistical imputation approaches, using varying levels of environmental information, for five plant traits (leaf biomass to sapwood area ratio, leaf nitrogen content, maximum tree height, leaf mass per area and wood density) in a spatially explicit plant trait dataset of temperate and Mediterranean tree species (Ecological and Forest Inventory of Catalonia, IEFC, dataset for Catalonia, north-east Iberian Peninsula, 31 900 km(2)). We simulated gaps at different missingness levels (10-80 %) in a complete trait matrix, and we used overall trait means, species means, k nearest neighbours (kNN), ordinary and regression kriging, and multivariate imputation using chained equations (MICE) to impute missing trait values. We assessed these methods in terms of their accuracy and of their ability to preserve trait distributions, multi-trait correlation structure and bivariate trait relationships. The relatively good performance of mean and species mean imputations in terms of accuracy masked a poor representation of trait distributions and multivariate trait structure. Species identity improved MICE imputations for all traits, whereas forest structure and topography improved imputations for some traits. No method performed best consistently for the five studied traits, but, considering all traits and performance metrics, MICE informed by relevant ecological variables gave the best results. However, at higher missingness (> 30 %), species mean imputations and regression kriging tended to outperform MICE for some traits. MICE informed by relevant ecological variables allowed us to fill the gaps in the IEFC incomplete dataset (5495 plots) and quantify imputation uncertainty. Resulting spatial patterns of the studied traits in Catalan forests were broadly similar when using species means, regression kriging or the best-performing MICE application, but some important discrepancies were observed at the local level. Our results highlight the need to assess imputation quality beyond just imputation accuracy and show that including environmental information in statistical imputation approaches yields more plausible imputations in spatially explicit plant trait datasets.",10.5194/bg-15-2601-2018,2018,J,"Poyatos, R; Sus, O; Badiella, L; Mencuccini, M; Martinez-Vilalta, J",BIOGEOSCIENCES,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CB
Woody species in resource-rich microrefugia of granite outcrops display unique functional signatures,"Refugia are key environments in biogeography and conservation. Because of their unique eco-evolutionary formation and functioning, they should display distinct functional trait signatures. However, comparative trait-based studies of plants in refugia and non-refugia are lacking. Here, we provide a comparison between resource-rich (putative microrefugia for species preferring mesic habitats under increasing aridity) and resource-impoverished woodlands (non-refugia) around two granite outcrops in south-western Australia. We measured and compared six functional traits (bark thickness, foliar delta C-13, foliar C:N, leaf dry matter content, plant height, specific leaf area) in four woody species. We performed multiple-trait, multiple-species and single-trait, within-species analyses to test whether plants in resource-rich habitats were functionally distinct and more diverse than those in the surrounding resource-impoverished woodlands. We found that species in resource-rich woodlands occupied larger and distinct multiple-trait functional spaces and showed distinct single-trait values (for specific leaf area and bark thickness). This suggests that plants in resource-rich woodlands can deploy unique and more diverse ecological strategies, potentially making these putative microrefugia more resilient to environmental changes. These findings suggest that species in microrefugia may be characterised by unique functional signatures, illustrating the utility of comparative trait-based approaches to improve understanding of the functioning of refugia.",10.1111/aec.12745,2019,J,"Ottaviani, G; Keppel, G; Marcantonio, M; Mucina, L; Wardell-Johnson, G",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,Southwestern Australia woody species,bark thickness; foliar C13; foliar C:N; LDMC; plant height; SLA,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Predicting biodiversity loss in island and countryside ecosystems through the lens of taxonomic and functional biogeography,"We investigate how variation in patch area and forest cover quantified for three different spatial scales (buffer size of 500, 1500 and 3000 m radius) affects species richness and functional diversity of bat assemblages in two ecosystems differing in fragment-matrix contrast: a landbridge island system in Panama and a countryside ecosystem in the Brazilian Amazon. Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in Panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in Brazil. Species-area relationships (SAR) were assessed based on Chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversity-area relationships (FAR) were quantified using Chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. FARs were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (FAR(ALL)), and trait subsets reflecting 'diet breadth' (FAR(DIET)) and 'dispersal ability' (FAR(DISPERSAL)). We found that in both study systems, FAR(ALL) was less sensitive to habitat loss than SAR, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant FAR(DISPERSAL) for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, FAR(DIET) and FAR(DISPERSAL) were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments.",10.1111/ecog.04507,2020,J,"Farneda, FZ; Grelle, CEV; Rocha, R; Ferreira, DF; Lopez-Baucells, A; Meyer, CFJ",ECOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,mammals,tropical forest; tropical islands Panama; tropical forest Brazil,body mass; trophic level; dietary specialization; vertical habitat stratification; wing aspect ratio; relative wing loading,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,habitat degredation,,,CB
GIFT - A Global Inventory of Floras and Traits for macroecology and biogeography,"Aim To understand how functional traits and evolutionary history shape the geographic distribution of plant life on Earth, we need to integrate high-quality and global-scale distribution data with functional and phylogenetic information. Large-scale distribution data for plants are, however, often restricted to either certain taxonomic groups or geographic regions. Range maps only exist for a small subset of all plant species and digitally available point-occurrence information is biased both geographically and taxonomically. Floras and checklists represent an alternative, yet rarely used potential source of information. They contain highly curated information about the species composition of a clearly defined area, and together virtually cover the entire global land surface. Here, we report on our recent efforts to mobilize this information for macroecological and biogeographical analyses in the GIFT database, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits. Location Global. Taxon Land plants (Embryophyta). Methods GIFT integrates plant distributions from regional Floras and checklists with functional traits, phylogenetic information, and region-level geographic, environmental and socio-economic data. It contains information about the floristic status (native, endemic, alien and naturalized) and takes advantage of the wealth of trait information in the regional Floras, complemented by data from global trait databases. Results GIFT 1.0 holds species lists for 2,893 regions across the whole globe including ~315,000 taxonomically standardized species names (i.e. c. 80% of all known land plant species) and ~3 million species-by-region occurrences.

Convergent elevation trends in canopy chemical traits of tropical forests,"The functional biogeography of tropical forests is expressed in foliar chemicals that are key physiologically based predictors of plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions including climate. However, understanding the degree to which environmental filters sort the canopy chemical characteristics of forest canopies remains a challenge. Here, we report on the elevation and soil-type dependence of forest canopy chemistry among 75 compositionally and environmentally distinct forests in nine regions, with a total of 7819 individual trees representing 3246 species collected, identified and assayed for foliar traits. We assessed whether there are consistent relationships between canopy chemical traits and both elevation and soil type, and evaluated the general role of phylogeny in mediating patterns of canopy traits within and across communities. Chemical trait variation and partitioning suggested a general model based on four interconnected findings. First, geographic variation at the soil-Order level, expressing broad changes in fertility, underpins major shifts in foliar phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca). Second, elevation-dependent shifts in average community leaf dry mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll, and carbon allocation (including nonstructural carbohydrates) are most strongly correlated with changes in foliar Ca. Third, chemical diversity within communities is driven by differences between species rather than by plasticity within species. Finally, elevation-and soil-dependent changes in N, LMA and leaf carbon allocation are mediated by canopy compositional turnover, whereas foliar P and Ca are driven more by changes in site conditions than by phylogeny.

"Global biogeography of Streptomyces antibiotic inhibition, resistance, and resource use","Although recent molecular techniques have greatly expanded our knowledge of microbial biogeography, the functional biogeography of soil microorganisms remains poorly understood. In this work, we explore geographic variation in Streptomyces phenotypes that are critical to species interactions. Specifically, we characterize Streptomyces from different locations from multiple continents for antibiotic inhibition, resistance, and resource use phenotypes. Streptomyces from different locations varied significantly in antibiotic inhibition, resistance, and resource use indicating that communities vary in functional potential. Among all isolates, there were substantial differences in antibiotic inhibition, resistance, and resource use within and among and within Streptomyces species. Moreover, Streptomyces with near-identical 16S rRNA gene sequences from different locations sometimes differed significantly in inhibition, resistance, and resource use phenotypes, suggesting that these phenotypes may be locally adapted. Thus, in addition to a likely role of environmental filtering, variation in Streptomyces inhibitory, resistance, and resource use phenotypes among locations is likely to be a consequence of local selection mediated by species interactions.",10.1111/1574-6941.12307,2014,J,"Schlatter, DC; Kinkel, LL",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,bacteria,soil microbes globablly,antibiotic inhibition (inhibition zone >2mm); antibiotic resistance (inhibition zone <2mm); niche width; resource use efficiency; efficiency on preferred resources,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Additional review: global biogeographic patterns, but no environmental drivers assessed","COLE: tough, because I can see an argument for their 'habitat type' information they collected being some sort of environmental filter, but I don't think they actually do anything with that information in a 'filtering' way during the analysis, so would agree with not relevant",CB
The quality of organic matter shapes the functional biogeography of bacterioplankton across boreal freshwater ecosystems,"Aim The need to go beyond taxonomy to understand patterns in microbial function has led to an increased use of trait-based approaches, yet we know little about how microbial functional traits vary across large-scale environmental gradients in natural ecosystems. Here, we apply a trait-based approach to explore the large-scale variability in the trait structure underlying the processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by boreal bacterioplankton communities, as well as its regulation and links to taxonomic composition. Location Samples were collected from 296 rivers and lakes across five regions in northern Quebec (Canada), which span large gradients in environmental, climatic and geographical properties typical of the boreal zone. Methods We used the metabolic profiles obtained with Biolog EcoPlates as an imprint of the trait structure underlying bacterial processing of DOM, and Illumina sequencing of the 16SrRNA gene to characterize the taxonomic composition of these bacterial assemblages. The resulting spatial patterns were compared with an array of climatic, landscape and limnological properties varying at the landscape scale. Results Despite a clear regional segregation of the sampled sites based on environmental variables, the trait structure of boreal bacteria did not show any regional or ecosystem-specific patterns, but rather was linked to a gradient of quality of DOM. Community trait configurations diverged progressively with decreasing terrestrial influence, probably due to local processes that transform and diversify the available pool of DOM. This DOM quality gradient did not explain the taxonomic biogeography of these communities, which was controlled by a different set of environmental factors. Main conclusions The functional biogeography of boreal bacterioplankton is driven by the nature of the DOM pool, and particularly by the influence of terrestrial DOM. The lack of coherence between functional and taxonomic biogeographies implies that the environmental controls of freshwater bacterial performance cannot be directly inferred from spatial patterns in taxonomic composition.",10.1111/geb.12356,2015,J,"Ruiz-Gonzalez, C; Nino-Garcia, JP; Lapierre, JF; del Giorgio, PA",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,bacteria,boreal freshwater lakes and streams (Quebec),substrate utilization profiles for dissolved 02 content,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,extent of DOM input major driver of substrait utilization signatures in boreal freshwater systems,"COLE: agree with trait classification, but unsure what the question in the AdditionalReview column was?",CB
The biogeography of fertilization mode in the sea,"Aim Knowledge of the biogeography of life histories is central to understanding and predicting the impacts of global change on key functional traits that shape species distributions and transcend taxonomic boundaries. Whether species are internal or external fertilizers is a fundamental aspect of reproductive diversity in the sea, and has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, geographic variation in this trait and the factors that potentially drive it (e.g. transitions in associated life-history traits, ecological conditions that favour one mode over the other or the evolutionary history of species) remain poorly characterized.

Methods We collated life-history data (modes of fertilization and development), geographic data and biophysical data (sea-surface temperatures and food availability) for 1532 marine species spanning 17 invertebrate phyla. We used standard and phylogenetic logistic regressions to evaluate latitudinal gradients in fertilization mode, plus their interactions with development (transitions from planktonic to aplanktonic development, or fromfeeding to non-feeding larvae) and taxonomy. We also explored the dependence of fertilization mode on biophysical variables to understand how ecology potentially contributes to geographic variation in this trait. Results Fertilization mode often varies predictably with latitude, but the exact nature of this relationship depends on developmental mode and the phylum under consideration. Some commonalities were evident, however, with the likelihood of internal fertilization declining at higher latitudes for Annelida and Echinodermata with aplanktonic development, but increasing at higher latitudes for Cnidaria and Porifera with non-feeding, planktonic larvae. Synergistic effects of temperature and food availability may potentially shape some of these patterns. Main conclusions There are latitudinal gradients in fertilization mode in the sea. The variation among phyla and developmental modes, however, is a complexity that is unexplained by existing theory. Combined effects of recent adaptation and deeper phylogenetic history have probably shaped this systematic variation in the reproductive ecology of marine organisms.",10.1111/geb.12358,2015,J,"Monro, K; Marshall, DJ",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,observational,marine,invertebrates,global,fertilization mode; development mode,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,"Additional review: use global database, so include as meta-analysis or eview? create predictive plot for temp-chlorophyll and likelihood of trait.

Global patterns and drivers of species and trait composition in diatoms,"Aim To examine species and trait composition in stream diatoms along environmental, climatic and spatial gradients and to ascertain if the use of different levels of biological organization is beneficial for investigating global environmental changes and the role of history in structuring communities. Location Global cover with datasets from the Antilles, France, Finland, New Zealand, La Reunion and the United States. Methods We related diatom species composition, guild composition, total richness and richness across guilds to environmental, climatic and spatial variables. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with environmental variable fitting, redundancy analysis (RDA) with variation partitioning, analysis of similarities and linear mixed models as statistical tools. Results Species composition differed significantly among the study regions, while the differences in guild composition were less pronounced. US and French streams shared a large number of species, whereas islands shared only a few species with continents. For species composition, all predictors showed significant relationships with diatoms but pH, longitude, annual temperature and precipitation had the strongest impact. Variation partitioning revealed that the local environment outperformed climatic and spatial variables. For guild composition, there was a substantial overlap across regions in NMDS. The results from RDA demonstrated, however, that guild composition was better explained than species composition, especially by environmental variables. Both species and guild richness were significantly correlated with most predictors. Notably, species richness scaled positively with latitude. Main conclusions Diatom species and guild composition varied substantially in response to local environment and climatic and spatial variables indicating both environmental and historical effects. Species composition discriminated the geographical regions better, while guild composition detected the environmental gradients better. This emphasizes the need to examine different levels of organization to gain a deeper understanding of the roles of environment versus history in structuring communities. These findings suggest that diatom species distributions are under strong microevolutionary constraints. Conversely, guild distributions are less dependent on historic factors and are driven primarily by the environment, which makes them better suited for research on global environmental change.",10.1111/geb.12452,2016,J,"Soininen, J; Jamoneau, A; Rosebery, J; Passy, SI",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,phytoplankton,global streams,body size; N fixation; acid tolerance; water column position; motility,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
"Host species identity, site and time drive temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial community structure","Background: The increasing awareness of the role of phyllosphere microbial communities in plant health calls for a greater understanding of their structure and dynamics in natural ecosystems. Since most knowledge of tree phyllosphere bacterial communities has been gathered in tropical forests, our goal was to characterize the community structure and assembly dynamics of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in temperate forests in Quebec, Canada. We targeted five dominant tree species: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca. We collected 180 samples of phyllosphere communities on these species at four natural forest sites, three times during the growing season. Results: Host functional traits (i.e., wood density, leaf nitrogen content) and climate variables (summer mean temperature and precipitation) were strongly correlated with community structure. We highlight three key findings: (1) temperate tree species share a ""core microbiome""; (2) significant evolutionary associations exist between groups of bacteria and host species; and (3) a greater part of the variation in phyllosphere bacterial community assembly is explained by host species identity (27 %) and species-site interaction (14 %), than by site (11 %) or time (1 %). Conclusions: We demonstrated that host species identity is a stronger driver of temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial communities than site or time. Our results suggest avenues for future studies on the influence of host functional traits on phyllosphere community functional biogeography across terrestrial biomes.",10.1186/s40168-016-0174-1,2016,J,"Laforest-Lapointe, I; Messier, C; Kembel, SW",MICROBIOME,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Traits of hosts (as environmental filter) rather than traits of taxa responding to gradient,CB
Plant community structure and nitrogen inputs modulate the climate signal on leaf traits,"AimLeaf traits strongly impact biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding leaf trait variation along environmental gradients is thus essential to improve the representation of vegetation in Earth system models. Our aims were to quantify relationships between leaf traits and climate in permanent grasslands at a biogeographical scale and to test whether these relationships were sensitive to (a) the level of nitrogen inputs and (b) the inclusion of information pertaining to plant community organization. LocationPermanent grasslands throughout France. MethodsWe combined existing datasets on climate, soil, nitrogen inputs (fertilization and deposition), species composition and four traits, namely specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, for 15,865 French permanent grasslands. Trait-climate relationships were tested using the following four climatic variables available across 1,833 pixels (5 kmx5 km): mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), and two indices accounting for the length of the growing season. We compared these relationships at the pixel level using either using community-level or species' trait means. ResultsOur findings were as follows: (a) leaf traits related to plant nutrient economy shift consistently along a gradient of growing season length accounting for temperature and soil water limitations of plant growth (GSL(tw)); (b) weighting leaf traits by species abundance in local communities is pivotal to capture leaf trait-environment relationships correctly at a biogeographical scale; and (c) the relationships between traits and GSL(tw) weaken for grasslands with a high nitrogen input. Main conclusionsThe effects of climate on plant communities are better described using composite descriptors than coarse variables such as MAT or MAP, but appear weaker for high-nitrogen grasslands. Using information at the community level tends to strengthen trait-climate relationships. The interplay of land management, community assembly and bioclimate appears crucial to the prediction of leaf trait variations and their effects on biogeochemical cycles.",10.1111/geb.12623,2017,J,"Borgy, B; Violle, C; Choler, P; Denelle, P; Munoz, F; Kattge, J; Lavorel, S; Loranger, J; Amiaud, B; Bahn, M; van Bodegom, PM; Brisse, H; Debarros, G; Diquelou, S; Gachet, S; Jolivet, C; Lemauviel-Lavenant, S; Mikolajczak, A; Olivier, J; Ordonez, J; de Ruffray, P; Viovy, N; Garnier, E",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,grasslands,leaf area; LDMC; leaf nitrogen; leaf phosphorous,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,habitat degredation,,,CB
"Foliar pH, an emerging plant functional trait: Biogeography and variability across northern China","Aims Plant pH is a functional trait deserving more attention than the current few studies at local scales, given its roles in nutrient cycling and physiological processes. How plant pH varies and is regulated at large scales remain unclear. Here we explore the biogeography of foliar pH and the potential drivers. Location East-west transect of northern China with increasing aridity westward. Time period 2016-2017. Major taxa Spermatophytes. Methods We analysed foliar pH of plants from 22 sites across northern China, and investigated its spatial pattern and relationships with climate, soil, and plant functional type (PFT). Results Foliar pH was generally acidic (5.33 +/- .04) in northern China, showing distinct geographical variability: foliar pH decreased significantly westward at an average rate of 0.25 units per 10 degrees longitude. Climate, soil and PFT explained 11, 17 and 59% of the variance in foliar pH, respectively. Foliar pH decreased (about 0.16) with mean annual precipitation (per 100 mm), soil stress coefficient (per 10%) and aridity index (per 0.14), but increased with mean annual temperature (per 2 degrees C). Across PFTs, herbs exhibited higher foliar pH than woody plants (6.0 vs. 4.9); gymnosperms relative to angiosperms had lower foliar pH (3.7 vs. 5.6); and monocotyledons showed higher foliar pH compared with dicotyledons (6.0 vs. 5.5). Main conclusions This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the evident pattern of foliar pH over a large spatial scale. Foliar pH is higher in warm-arid northwestern relative to cold-humid northeastern China and in later- than earlier-evolved plants. Similar to leaf mineral elements, foliar-pH biogeography is shaped by the joint effects of climate, soil and PFT; PFT and moisture are the most influential factors. Our findings provide a new impetus for understanding functional biogeography, and lay the groundwork for research on the linkage of foliar pH to ecological functions and macroevolutionary implications.",10.1111/geb.12860,2019,J,"Liu, SN; Yan, ZB; Chen, YH; Zhang, MX; Chen, J; Han, WX",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,multipe across China,pH,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Linking plant and ecosystem functional biogeography,"Classical biogeographical observations suggest that ecosystems are strongly shaped by climatic constraints in terms of their structure and function. On the other hand, vegetation function feeds back on the climate system via biosphere-atmosphere exchange of matter and energy. Ecosystem-level observations of this exchange reveal very large functional biogeographical variation of climate-relevant ecosystem functional properties related to carbon and water cycles. This variation is explained insufficiently by climate control and a classical plant functional type classification approach. For example, correlations between seasonal carbon-use efficiency and climate or environmental variables remain below 0.6, leaving almost 70% of variance unexplained. We suggest that a substantial part of this unexplained variation of ecosystem functional properties is related to variations in plant and microbial traits. Therefore, to progress with global functional biogeography, we should seek to understand the link between organismic traits and flux-derived ecosystem properties at ecosystem observation sites and the spatial variation of vegetation traits given geoecological covariates. This understanding can be fostered by synergistic use of both data-driven and theory-driven ecological as well as biophysical approaches.",10.1073/pnas.1216065111,2014,J,"Reichstein, M; Bahn, M; Mahecha, MD; Kattge, J; Baldocchi, DD",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Additional review: discuss relation of physiological traits to environment and latitude, but only present data published elsewhere in figs (not new analysis)",COLE: agree not relevant,CB
Macrophysiology - progress and prospects,"1. Macrophysiology is the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographic and temporal scales and the ecological implications of this variation. It has now been undertaken, as a defined field, for a decade. Here, we overview its conceptual foundations, methodological approaches and insights, together with challenges the field is facing currently. 2. Macrophysiology builds on approaches that investigate the ecological and evolutionary significance of physiological trait variation and feedbacks in these processes. One of its key strengths is its ability to provide a basis for examining interactions among the intraspecific, interspecific and assemblage levels. 3. Macrophysiology is distinct from and typically concerns larger spatial and temporal scales than conservation physiology, whereas it is in several respects similar to, but antecedes, functional biogeography. Contrary to some claims, macrophysiology is not concerned only with the implications for geographic ranges of physiological trait variation. 5. Several insights, which would not otherwise have been achieved, have arisen from the field, notably the understanding of variation in global patterns of upper and lower lethal temperature limits and organism performance, which have important implications for forecasting the impacts of climate change. 6. Ten major challenges are identified for the field of macroecology, including better integration of approaches and information for plants and animals.

"National forest inventories as a tool for understanding the evolution, maintenance and functioning of species diversity","Although national forest inventories (NFIs) appeared with the aim of administrate and manage timber resources, its use has been generalised among ecologists. NFIs have been currently proved as very useful tools to understand forest responses to multiple drivers of global change. However, NFIs also allow answering other more fundamental questions in ecology related to understanding the origin, maintenance, and functioning of species diversity. Thanks to the comprehensive and georeferenced information that NFIs present for local communities along broad environmental gradients, they can serve to foster the emergent field of functional biogeography, which aims to understand the factors, mechanisms, and processes explaining the geographic distribution of species through their functional traits. Equally important, NFIs allow investigating differences in species' niche through their competitive responses, and which can be the structural, environmental and functional predictors of these niche differences. Finally, NFIs can serve to study the effects of species diversity in the provision of multiple ecosystem services resulting not only from tree species and other trophic levels but also from forest soils. Despite their enormous potential, NFIs are limited in several aspects, which would be desirable to solve in the near future including lack of homogeneity of sampling protocols between countries, limitation in the data accessibility, linkages between soil and tree data, and inclusion of intra-specific variation in functional traits.",10.7818/ECOS.2016.25-3.09,2016,J,"Godoy, O; Rueda, M",ECOSISTEMAS,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Could not find English version for review,"COLE: I also looked, couldn't find english version",CB
Organismic-Scale Remote Sensing of Canopy Foliar Traits in Lowland Tropical Forests,"Airborne high fidelity imaging spectroscopy (HiFIS) holds great promise for bridging the gap between field studies of functional diversity, which are spatially limited, and satellite detection of ecosystem properties, which lacks resolution to understand within landscape dynamics. We use Carnegie Airborne Observatory HiFIS data combined with field collected foliar trait data to develop quantitative prediction models of foliar traits at the tree-crown level across over 1000 ha of humid tropical forest. We predicted foliar leaf mass per area (LMA) as well as foliar concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium for canopy emergent trees (R-2: 0.45-0.67, relative RMSE: 11%-14%). Correlations between remotely sensed model coefficients for these foliar traits are similar to those found in laboratory studies, suggesting that the detection of these mineral nutrients is possible through their biochemical stoichiometry. Maps derived from HiFIS provide quantitative foliar trait information across a tropical forest landscape at fine spatial resolution, and along environmental gradients. Multi-nutrient maps implemented at the fine organismic scale will subsequently provide new insight to the functional biogeography and biological diversity of tropical forest ecosystems.",10.3390/rs8020087,2016,J,"Chadwick, KD; Asner, GP",REMOTE SENSING,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Description of new remote sensing trait quantification method but no relation to enviro filters,COLE: Agree,CB
Functional biogeography of dietary strategies in birds,"Aim Diet is key to understanding resource use by species, their relationships with their environment and biotic interactions. We aimed to identify the major strategies that shape the diet space of birds and to investigate their spatial distributions in association with biogeographical, bioclimatic and anthropogenic drivers. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods We analysed score-based assessments of eight diet categories for 8,937 out of 10,964 extant bird species. We constructed a multivariate diet space by ordinating these data in a principal coordinates analysis and assessed its dimensionality as a balance between the representation of original diet scores and parsimony. We averaged the positions of species along each dimension for 12,705 species assemblages and used quantile regressions to infer the relative contributions of species richness, climate, primary productivity, topography and human footprint to the spatial distribution of the diet space at a global scale. Results The diet space of birds was structured by four dimensions ordinating species along continua ranging from insectivory to plant-based strategies, granivory to frugivory, common to rare diets, and nectarivory to carnivory and piscivory. Although orthogonal at the species level, these dimensions were correlated among species assemblages, with regional variation consistent with past climatic and tectonic events. Human footprint packed bird assemblages in the diet space, whereas warm climate, high productivity and high topographic variability were associated with high variability in the prevalence of dietary strategies among assemblages. Main conclusions The tremendous variability in bird diets can be explained by a few basic ecological continua sustained by morphological and ecophysiological differences among species. Strong biogeographical legacies on top of bioclimatic drivers distribute this diet space in species assemblages through environmental filtering and niche packing. However, these patterns are altered at macroecological scales by human-mediated functional homogenization, which might, in turn, affect the global distribution of bird functions and services.",10.1111/geb.12910,2019,J,"Barnagaud, JY; Mazet, N; Munoz, F; Grenie, M; Denelle, P; Sobral, M; Kissling, WD; Sekercioglu, CH; Violle, C",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,birds,global,diet,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,COLE: recommend changing trait to simply 'diet',CB
"Associations between habitat quality, body size and reproductive fitness in the alpine endemic spider Vesubia jugorum","Aim In theory, the highest-quality habitat across a species' range should support individuals with the highest fitness, making it possible to evaluate the outputs of species distribution models (SDMs) by exploring the relationship between habitat quality and functional traits related to species' fitness. However, this relationship has been tested almost exclusively in plants. We investigated the degree to which morphological and reproductive traits of an alpine spider varied along a gradient of habitat quality projected via SDMs. Location South-western Alps (France and Italy). Time period 2007-2018. Major taxa studied Vesubia jugorum (Arachnida: Araneae: Lycosidae). Methods We used climatic, topographical and geomorphological variables at a resolution of 250 m to model habitat quality for V. jugorum, with multiple algorithms (generalized additive models, boosted regression trees and maximum entropy models). We collected spiders in the field and measured their body size and egg-case size (a functional trait related to reproductive success). We tested the relationship between functional traits and habitat quality with linear mixed models. Results All SDM algorithms we tested fit the data well, with similar explanatory ability. Models revealed a positive relationship between the probability of presence and cumulative precipitation and percentage of rock. An additional important variable in the SDMs was duration of snow coverage, with optimal projected habitat quality between 40 and 100 days/year with snow. Modelled habitat quality was positively associated with maximum body and egg-case size. Main conclusions Our work provides evidence of a positive association between projected habitat quality and traits of a terrestrial invertebrate. A model that fits the data well potentially can be used to predict variations in species' traits, thus offering an experimental test of SDM projections with field-collected data.

Relationships between phyllosphere bacterial communities and plant functional traits in a neotropical forest,"The phyllosphere-the aerial surfaces of plants, including leaves-is a ubiquitous global habitat that harbors diverse bacterial communities. Phyllosphere bacterial communities have the potential to influence plant biogeography and ecosystem function through their influence on the fitness and function of their hosts, but the host attributes that drive community assembly in the phyllosphere are poorly understood. In this study we used high-throughput sequencing to quantify bacterial community structure on the leaves of 57 tree species in a neotropical forest in Panama. We tested for relationships between bacterial communities on tree leaves and the functional traits, taxonomy, and phylogeny of their plant hosts. Bacterial communities on tropical tree leaves were diverse; leaves from individual trees were host to more than 400 bacterial taxa. Bacterial communities in the phyllosphere were dominated by a core microbiome of taxa including Actinobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteria. Host attributes including plant taxonomic identity, phylogeny, growth and mortality rates, wood density, leaf mass per area, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were correlated with bacterial community structure on leaves. The relative abundances of several bacterial taxa were correlated with suites of host plant traits related to major axes of plant trait variation, including the leaf economics spectrum and the wood density-growth/mortality tradeoff. These correlations between phyllosphere bacterial diversity and host growth, mortality, and function suggest that incorporating information on plant-microbe associations will improve our ability to understand plant functional biogeography and the drivers of variation in plant and ecosystem function.",10.1073/pnas.1216057111,2014,J,"Kembel, SW; O'Connor, TK; Arnold, HK; Hubbell, SP; Wright, SJ; Green, JL",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Traits of hosts (as environmental filter) rather than traits of taxa responding to gradient,"COLE: agree. this is similar to the discussion we had about parasites, and I think it's beyond the scope of what we're doing to wade into these waters",CB
Sensitivity of community-level trait-environment relationships to data representativeness: A test for functional biogeography,"Aim: The characterization of trait-environment relationships over broad-scale gradients is a critical goal for ecology and biogeography. This implies the merging of plot and trait databases to assess community-level trait-based statistics. Potential shortcomings and limitations of this approach are that: (i) species traits are not measured where the community is sampled and (ii) the availability of trait data varies considerably across species and plots. Here we address the effect of trait data representativeness [the sampling effort per species and per plot] on the accuracy of (i) species-level and (ii) community-level trait estimates and (iii) the consequences for the shape and strength of trait-environment relationships across communities. Innovation: We combined information existing in databases of vegetation plots and plant traits to estimate community-weighted means [CWMs] of four key traits [specific leaf area, plant height, seed mass and leaf nitrogen content per dry mass] in permanent grasslands at a country-wide scale. We propose a generic approach for systematic sensitivity analyses based on random sub-sampling and data reduction to address the representativeness of incomplete and heterogeneous trait information when exploring trait-environment relationships across communities. Main conclusions: The accuracy of the CWMs was little affected by the number of individual trait values per species [NIV] but strongly affected by the cover proportion of species with available trait values [PCover]. A PCover above 80% was required for all four traits studied to obtain an estimation bias below 5%. Our approach therefore provides more conservative criteria than previously proposed. Restrictive criteria on both NIV and PCover primarily excluded communities in harsh environments, and such reduction of the sampled gradient weakened trait-environment relationships. These findings advocate systematic measurement campaigns in natural environments to increase species coverage in global trait databases, with special emphasis on species occurring in under-sampled and harsh environmental conditions.",10.1111/geb.12573,2017,J,"Borgy, B; Violle, C; Choler, P; Garnier, E; Kattge, J; Loranger, J; Amiaud, B; Cellier, P; Debarros, G; Denelle, P; Diquelou, S; Gachet, S; Jolivet, C; Lavorel, S; Lemauviel-Lavenant, S; Mikolajczak, A; Munoz, F; Olivier, J; Viovy, N",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Method for assessing trait sampling adequacy,COLE: agree.,CB
"Taxonomic and functional plant diversity of the Santorini-Christiana island group (Aegean Sea, Greece)","This is the first attempt to analyse vascular plant diversity patterns regarding the seven vegetated islands of the Santorini archipelago (Aegean Sea, Greece) as a whole. Hitherto unpublished floristic records, combined with critical use of taxonomic and chorological information from previous and most recent literature, resulted in a total of 696 infrageneric taxa (species and subspecies) occurring in the area. Detailed qualitative and quantitative phytodiversity spectra per individual island are presented, and floristic dissimilarity (beta-diversity) between islands is considered. Spatial distribution of 28 chorological, ecological, vegetative and reproductive traits for each recorded taxon have been calculated in order to detect regional and fundamental patterns in functional biogeography beyond traditional species-based approaches, based on both taxonomic and functional components of diversity. Mediterranean species constitute the most abundant chorological element and therophytes the most abundant life-form element in the region. Surface area is the most influential variable contributing to species richness; very strong relationships in (1) species per area, (2) functional richness per area and (3) functional richness per species richness are revealed for the Santorini archipelago.

Functional traits explain the Hutchinsonian niches of plant species,"Aim: The Hutchinsonian niche is a foundational concept in ecology and evolutionary biology that describes fundamental characteristics of any species: the global maximum population growth rate (rmax); the niche optimum (the environment for which rmax is reached); and the niche width (the environmental range for which intrinsic population growth rates are positive). We examine whether these characteristics are related to inter- and intraspecific variation in functional traits. Location: Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Time period: Present day. Major taxa studied: Twenty-six plant species (Proteaceae). Methods: We measured leaf, plant-architectural and seed traits across species geographical ranges. We then examined how species-mean traits are related to demographically derived niche characteristics of rmax, in addition to niche optima and widths in five environmental dimensions, and how intraspecific trait variation is related to niche widths. Results: Interspecific trait variation generally exceeded range-wide intraspecific trait variation. Species-mean trait values were associated with variation in rmax (R-2 = 0.27) but were more strongly related to niche optima (mean R-2 = 0.56). These relationships generally matched trait-environment associations described in the literature. Both species-mean traits and intraspecific trait variability were strongly related to niche widths (R-2 = 0.66 and 0.59, respectively). Moreover, niche widths increased with intraspecific trait variability. Overall, the different niche characteristics were associated with few, largely non-overlapping sets of traits. Main conclusions: Our study relating functional traits to Hutchinsonian niches demonstrates that key demographic properties of species relate to few traits with relatively strong effects. Our results further support the hypothesis that intraspecific trait variation increases species niche widths. Given that niche characteristics were related to distinct sets of traits, different aspects of environmental change might affect axes of trait variation independently. Trait-based studies of Hutchinsonian niches thus yield important insights into the mechanisms shaping functional biodiversity, which should reinforce the role of traits in functional biogeography.",10.1111/geb.13048,2020,J,"Treurnicht, M; Pagel, J; Tonnabel, J; Esler, KJ; Slingsby, JA; Schurr, FM",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,South Africa,SLA; leaf width; leaf longevity; leaf N; plant height; wood density; ramification; sprouting; seed mass; seed N; seed N:P ratio,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB

This additional information allowed to carry out some functional studies. In this paper we briefly review the most relevant results regarding: i) the geographical distribution of functional traits across levels of organization and intraspecific and interspecific variability along environmental gradients; ii) the positive relationship between species richness and timber production in Mediterranean forests; iii) the trend to higher growth during most of the twentieth century reversed from year 1970 by lower water availability and; iv) stoichiometric relationships of nutrients by species and functional groups along environmental gradients.

The functional biogeography of species: biogeographical species roles of birds in Wallacea and the West Indies,"Biogeographical systems can be analyzed as networks of species and geographical units. Within such a biogeographical network, individual species may differ fundamentally in their linkage pattern, and therefore hold different topological roles. To advance our understanding of the relationship between species traits and large-scale species distribution patterns in archipelagos, we use a network approach to classify birds as one of four biogeographical species roles: peripherals, connectors, module hubs, and network hubs. These roles are based upon the position of species within the modular network of islands and species in Wallacea and the West Indies. We test whether species traits - including habitat requirements, altitudinal range-span, feeding guild, trophic level, and body length - correlate with species roles. In both archipelagos, habitat requirements, altitudinal range-span and body length show strong relations to species roles. In particular, species that occupy coastal- and open habitats, as well as habitat generalists, show higher proportions of connectors and network hubs and thus tend to span several biogeographical modules (i.e. subregions). Likewise, large body size and a wide altitudinal range-span are related to a wide distribution on many islands and across several biogeographical modules. On the other hand, species restricted to interior forest are mainly characterized as peripherals and, thus, have narrow and localized distributions within biogeographical modules rather than across the archipelago-wide network. These results suggest that the ecological amplitude of a species is highly related to its geographical distribution within and across bio geographical subregions and furthermore supports the idea that large-scale species distributions relate to distributions at the local community level.

These suborders constitute a monophyletic group, but differ in their ecology and history of occupation of South America. We investigated the influence of biogeographic history on functional and phylogenetic diversities of Passeri and Tyranni in forest and savanna habitats in the Brazilian Amazon. We compiled species composition data for 34 Passeriformes assemblages, 12 in savannas and 22 in forests. We calculated the functional (Rao's quadratic entropy, FDQ) and phylogenetic diversities (mean pairwise distance, MPD, and mean nearest taxon distance, MNTD), and the functional beta diversity to investigate the potential role of biogeographic history in shaping ecological traits and species lineages of both suborders. The functional diversity of Passeri was higher than for Tyranni in both habitats. The MPD for Tyranni was higher than for Passeri in forests; however, there was no difference between the suborders in savannas. In savannas, Passeri presented higher MNTD than Tyranni, while in forest areas, Tyranni assemblages showed higher MNTD than Passeri. We found a high functional turnover (similar to 75%) between Passeri and Tyranni in both habitats. The high functional diversity of Passeri in both habitats is due to the high diversity of ecological traits exhibited by species of this group, which enables the exploitation of a wide variety of resources and foraging strategies. The higher Tyranni MPD and MNTD in forests is likely due to Tyranni being older settlers in this habitat, resulting in the emergence and persistence of more lineages. The higher Passeri MNTD in savannas can be explained by the existence of a larger number of different Passeri lineages adapted to this severe habitat. The high functional turnover between the suborders in both habitats suggests an ecological strategy to avoid niche overlap.",10.1002/ece3.3904,2018,J,"Almeida, SM; Juen, L; Sobral, FL; Santos, MPD",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CB
The Mutualistic Niche: Mycorrhizal Symbiosis and Community Dynamics,"The niche is generally viewed in terms of species' intrinsic physiological potential and limitations due to competition. Although DNA sequencing has revealed the ubiquity of beneficial microbial symbioses, the role of mutualisms in shaping species niches is not broadly recognized. In this review, I use a widespread terrestrial mutualism, the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, to help develop the mutualistic niche concept. Using contemporary niche theory, I show how mycorrhizal symbioses expand environmental ranges (requirement niche) and influence resource use (impact niche) for both plants and fungi. Simple niche models for competition between resource specialists and generalists also predict a range of ecological phenomena, from unexpected monodominance by some tropical trees to the functional biogeography of mycorrhizal symbiosis. A niche-based view of mutualism may also help explain stability of mutualisms even in the absence of clear benefits. The niche is a central concept in ecology, and better integration of mutualism will more accurately reflect the positive interactions experienced by nearly all species.",10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032100,2016,S,"Peay, KG","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 47",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Suggests correlation among dispersal traits and specificity important for creating niche models of ecchorizal fungi and host selection, but no data presented.","COLE: agree.

A trait space at an overarching scale yields more conclusive macroecological patterns of functional diversity,"Aim Macroecological studies have commonly used study-specific subsets of taxa to calculate metrics of functional diversity (FD) and explore their spatial patterns. However, FD metrics can be biased if the functional space (FS) does not cover an extensive, common and representative range of trait variation. Here, we propose an overarching FS covering the widest range of European freshwater taxa and trait variation compiled to date for a better evaluation of macroecological FD patterns. Location Six regions distributed from Morocco to Scandinavia. Time period 2008. Major taxa studied Major orders of European freshwater macroinvertebrates (541 taxa). Methods FD metrics (functional richness, dispersion and evenness) were estimated on FSs covering three decreasing grain sizes of trait variation: an overarching European scale (541 taxa), a continental context-dependent scale that covers six regions (180 taxa) and six regional scale FSs (63-108 taxa). Taxonomic richness and FD metrics were modelled over the latitudinal gradient. Null models were performed to assess if FD patterns were independent of taxonomic richness variation and to identify community assembly mechanisms (filtering or overdispersion) along the latitudinal gradient. Results The scale at which FSs were calculated influenced the shape and strength of the latitudinal FD patterns. Continental or regional scale FSs captured different axes of trait variation associated with scale-specific taxa composition. These FS axes and resulting FD metrics moderately or poorly represent those based on the overarching FS. Null model analysis revealed distinct latitudinal patterns for each FS and FD metric, which led to contrasting assembly mechanisms along latitude. Main conclusions An overarching FS (a) captures a wide, common and more representative range of trait variation, (b) offers a more generalizable framework to explore large-scale functional patterns and community assembly mechanisms, and (c) enhances the comparison of FD metrics across studies to obtain more reliable macroecological patterns.",10.1111/geb.13146,2020,J,"Murria, C; Iturrarte, G; Gutierrez-Canovas, G",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,invertebrates,North Africa-Northern Europe,maximum size; life cycle duration; reproductive cycles per year; aquatic stages; reproduction form; dissemination strategy; resistance form; respiration strategy; locomotion type,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
"Endemic species have highly integrated phenotypes, environmental distributions and phenotype-environment relationships","Aim Why are some species geographically restricted? Ecological explanations suggest that endemic species may have restricted distributions because limited phenotypic variability results in narrow niches. However, studying variability of traits independently may not fully explain the interactions within and between complex phenotypes and environments. Here, we hypothesize that endemic species are restricted to a narrow range of habitats due to strong phenotypic integration (i.e. strong correlations among traits), strong environmental integration (i.e. strong correlations among the environments occupied) and strong correlations among trait-environment combinations. Location The Kerguelen Islands, sub-Antarctic. Methods We measured flowering phenology, multiple morphological characters, and species distribution along three abiotic environmental gradients (elevation, soil moisture and soil salinity) in 14 plant species whose distributions range from strictly endemic to cosmopolitan. Results We found that for individual species, trait means and variances were independent of endemism, but that endemics occupied higher and less variable microhabitats. However, phenotypic integration, environmental integration along the three gradients, and the strength of trait-environment correlations all increased with the level of species endemism. Main conclusions Higher levels of integration within and between phenotypes and environments are associated with more restricted geographical ranges in the species studied. In endemic species phenotypic integration may explain range contraction during the taxon cycle and reduce the ability to adapt to novel microhabitats formed as a result of environmental change.",10.1111/jbi.12095,2013,J,"Hermant, M; Prinzing, A; Vernon, P; Convey, P; Hennion, F",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,sub-Antarctic,plant height; plant diameter; length of largest leaf; flowering stage,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
A framework for estimating species-specific contributions to community indicators,"Community Weighted Means (CWM) are valuable tools describing community composition with respect to one given trait. They have been widely used as indicators in global change studies to measure biodiversity responses to environmental perturbations. However, how individual species contribute to such community indicators has hardly been investigated. One of the reasons lies in the absence of a methodological framework relating changes in community dynamics to species-specific population variations. Here, we present a comprehensive framework allowing a finer interpretation of changes in CWM, and we propose a way to compute species contributions to these indicators. We present an analytical framework allowing the quantification of species-specific contributions to changes in the mean (CWM) and the variance (Community Weighted Variance, CWV) of trait distributions in species assemblages monitored through time and space. We apply this approach to a case study investigating the impact of climate change on common bird assemblages in the French Mediterranean area between 2001 and 2012. This approach allows us to identify that a small proportion of the species drive the changes observed at the community level indicator, and allows the identification of those species. Moreover, we show that the species-specific contributions are not homogeneous between taxonomic groups and that migratory species tend to have a higher impact. This novel decomposition and interpretation of Community Weighted Means and Variances (for which specific software package is provided along with this article) sheds new light on the drivers of community modifications in response to environmental changes across time and space. Moreover, it represents a relevant and simple way to assess particular aspects of species-specific responses to environmental changes and it is straightforward to use for widely used ecological data on any species group.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.069,2019,J,"Gauzere, P; Doulcier, G; Devictor, V; Kefi, S",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Note: Methods paper,COLE: agree,CB
Geographical variation of body size in sigmodontine rodents depends on both environment and phylogenetic composition of communities,"Aim Body size variation in animal assemblages is a widely addressed pattern in biogeographical studies, and is affected by both environmental gradients and phylogenetic constraints. However, no study has yet explored to what extent the association between body size variation and environmental gradients across broad spatial scales is influenced by the biogeographical distribution of different phylogenetic lineages. In this study, we discriminate the influences of environmental variables and phylogenetic community composition on body size variation in South American sigmodontine rodents. Location South America. Methods We computed the mean body mass of sigmodontine species cooccurring in 1 x 1 degrees cells across South America. For each cell we recorded mean values for three environmental variables. We characterized the phylogenetic composition of sigmodontine assemblages within each cell using phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting and principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS). We then partitioned out the influence of environmental factors and the phylogenetic community composition on mean body size. Results Mean body size variation was mostly explained by shared influence of phylogenetic community composition (PCPS) and environmental factors (68%), while exclusive influence of PCPS was low (19%), and of environment was even lower (0.47%). Increases in body size were related to increases in annual mean temperature, and the influence of environment on body size was mediated by the distribution of sigmodontine lineages across South America. Main conclusions Environment alone was not sufficient to explain body size variation in sigmodontine assemblages. Rather, environmental gradients interacted with historical processes to determine body size variation in the Neotropical assemblages. These results have implications for the way we think of body size gradients across species assemblages, because any gradient in a trait may be a result of differences in the biogeographical distribution of lineages across space, which should be considered in an explicit context.",10.1111/jbi.12718,2016,J,"Maestri, R; Luza, AL; de Barros, LD; Hartz, SM; Ferrari, A; de Freitas, TRO; Duarte, LDS",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,mammals,South America,body size,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Assessing the joint behaviour of species traits as filtered by environment,"Understanding and predicting how species traits are shaped by prevailing environmental conditions is an important yet challenging task in ecology. Functional trait-based approaches can replace potentially idiosyncratic species-specific response models in learning about community behaviour across environmental gradients. Customarily, models for traits given environment consider only trait means to predict species and functional diversity, as intra-taxon variability in traits is often thought to be negligible. A growing body of literature indicates that intra-taxon trait variability is substantial and critical in structuring plant communities and assessing ecosystem function. We propose flexible joint trait distribution models given environment and across species that incorporate intra-taxon variability as well as inter-site/plot variability. Using a Bayesian framework, our joint trait distribution models allow for mixed continuous, binary and ordinal trait variables and incorporate dependence among traits enabling both joint and conditional trait prediction at unobserved sites. The models can be used to inform about the well-known fourth-corner problem, which attempts to interpret trait-by-environment matrices. We demonstrate the utility of our methodology through joint predictive trait distributions for individual species as well as joint community-weighted trait distributions for environments while incorporating intra-taxon trait variability. Explicit details on the probabilistic interpretations of the random trait-by-environment matrices obtained arising under our model are also provided to address the fourth-corner problem. Finally, our joint trait distribution model is applied to simulated and real vegetation data collected from the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. The proposed methodology places a fully model-based foundation on explaining intra-taxon trait variation given environment. It extends the utility and interpretability of commonly applied techniques for investigating community-weighted traits and illuminates randomness in the fourth-corner problem.",10.1111/2041-210X.12901,2018,J,"Schliep, EM; Gelfand, AE; Mitchell, RM; Aiello-Lammens, ME; Silander, JA",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Note: Methods paper,agree,CB
Historical stability promoted higher functional specialization and originality in Neotropical stream fish assemblages,"Aim: Disturbances are events that influence the structure of biological assemblages, yet how historical disturbances have affected the functional structure of recent assemblages is still poorly known. We used species functional traits to investigate the effects of historical disturbances, such as past climate change (aridification), on the current structure of stream fish assemblages. Location: Amazon Basin and Brazilian Northeast streams. Methods: We used measures of functional specialization and originality to assess the effects of historical disturbances on the structure of fish assemblages in streams with similar local environmental conditions in each biome (Amazonia and Caatinga). For this, we measured 15 traits related to locomotion, feeding and habitat use for each species sampled. We then compared the functional structure of each assemblage expressed as functional richness (FRic) and evenness (FEve) between biomes. We also used structured and random simulations of species extinctions to identify the influence of the loss of original and specialized species due to historical disturbance. Results: We found high levels of functional specialization in Amazonia (historically more stable) and redundancy in Caatinga (higher frequency of historical disturbances) regional assemblages, regardless of the inter-biome differences in species richness. These results were also detected in local assemblages, suggesting that the effect of historical disturbances influences the structure of fish assemblages, both at small and large spatial scales. Main conclusions: The historical stability in Amazonian fish assemblages may have favoured a higher taxonomic and FRic, as well as greater functional specialization and originality, compared to Caatinga assemblages. Our results reinforce the importance of understanding and evaluating the evolutionary history of ecosystems in order to describe the current functional structure of species assemblages.",10.1111/jbi.13205,2018,J,"Rodrigues, CAS; Leitao, RP; Zuanon, J; Sanchez-Botero, JI; Baccaro, FB",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,fish,Neotropical streams,mouth-protrusion length; oral-gape length; oral-gape shape; oral-gape position; eye size; eye position; body transversal shape; body transversal surface; pectoral fin position; aspect ratio pectoral fin; caudal penduncle throttling; caudal fin aspect ratio; fins surface ratio; fins surface to body size ratio; body mass,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,climate change,"Additional review: latitudinal biogeographic patterns, but no environmental drivers assessed",COLE: I agree I think it's relevant.

Distinguishing the signatures of local environmental filtering and regional trait range limits in the study of trait-environment relationships,"Understanding the imprint of environmental filtering on community assembly along environmental gradients is a key objective of trait-gradient analyses. Depending on local constraints, this filtering generally entails that species departing from an optimum trait value have lower abundances in the community. The community-weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of trait values are then expected to depict the optimum and intensity of filtering, respectively. However, the trait distribution within the regional species pool and its limits can also affect local CWM and CWV values apart from the effect of environmental filtering. The regional trait range limits are more likely to be reached in communities at the extremes of environmental gradients. Analogous to the mid-domain effect in biogeography, decreasing CWV values in extreme environments can then represent the influence of regional trait range limits rather than stronger filtering in the local environment. We name this effect the 'trait-gradient boundary effect' (TGBE). First, we use a community assembly framework to build simulated communities along a gradient from a species pool and environmental filtering with either constant or varying intensity while accounting for immigration processes. We demonstrate the significant influence of TGBE, in parallel to environmental filtering, on CWM and CWV at the extremes of the environmental gradient. We provide a statistical tool based on Approximate Bayesian Computation to decipher the respective influence of local environmental filtering and regional trait range limits. Second, as a case study, we reanalyze the functional composition of alpine plant communities distributed along a gradient of snow cover duration. We show that leaf trait convergence found in communities at the extremes of the gradient reflect an influence of trait range limits rather than stronger environmental filtering. These findings challenge correlative trait-environment relationships and call for more explicitly identifying the mechanisms responsible of trait convergence/divergence along environmental gradients.",10.1111/oik.05851,2019,J,"Denelle, P; Violle, C; Munoz, F",OIKOS,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Note: methods paper,agree,CB
"Effects of climate, soil, forest structure and land use on the functional composition of the understorey in Italian forests","Question In functional biogeography studies, generalizable patterns in the relationship between plant traits and the environment have yet to emerge. Local drivers (i.e., soil, land use, vegetation structure) can increase our understanding of the trait-environment relationship. What is the role of climate and local drivers in shaping abundance-weighted trait patterns of forest understories at biogeographic scales? Location Italian forests. Methods We selected 201 sites that are statistically representative for the heterogeneity of Italian forests across three biogeographic regions (alpine, continental, and mediterranean). Understorey vegetation was recorded for each site on an area of 400 m(2), together with 25 environmental variables related to climate, soil, land use and forest structure. Specific leaf area (SLA), plant height (H) and seed mass (SM) were obtained from databases. Community-weighted mean (CWM) values were calculated. Variance partitioning was used to identify the relative role of groups of environmental variables on the CWM of traits. Generalized Additive Models were used to assess the relationship between traits and single variables. Results Climate alone and climate-soil interactions explained the largest proportion of the variation of all the traits (13.7% to 22.8%). Temperature-related factors as well as soil N and P availability were the climatic and edaphic explanatory variables most correlated to trait variation. Forest structure and land use accounted for a smaller percentage of the variation in traits. Land-use factors alone were important in explaining only SLA variation.

Functional diversity enhances the resistance of ecosystem multifunctionality to aridity in Mediterranean drylands,"We used a functional trait-based approach to assess the impacts of aridity and shrub encroachment on the functional structure of Mediterranean dryland communities (functional diversity (FD) and community-weighted mean trait values (CWM)), and to evaluate how these functional attributes ultimately affect multifunctionality (i.e. the provision of several ecosystem functions simultaneously). Shrub encroachment (the increase in the abundance/cover of shrubs) is a major land cover change that is taking place in grasslands worldwide. Studies conducted on drylands have reported positive or negative impacts of shrub encroachment depending on the functions and the traits of the sprouting or nonsprouting shrub species considered. FD and CWM were equally important as drivers of multifunctionality responses to both aridity and shrub encroachment. Size traits (e.g. vegetative height or lateral spread) and leaf traits (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) captured the effect of shrub encroachment on multifunctionality with a relative high accuracy (r(2)=0.63). FD also improved the resistance of multifunctionality along the aridity gradient studied. Maintaining and enhancing FD in plant communities may help to buffer negative effects of ongoing global environmental change on dryland multifunctionality.",10.1111/nph.13268,2015,J,"Valencia, E; Maestre, FT; Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Y; Quero, JL; Tamme, R; Borger, L; Garcia-Gomez, M; Gross, N",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,Mediterranean dryland,vegetative height; lateral spread; branching density; ramification; leaf area; leaf length; leaf width; leaf thickness; LDMC,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,climate change,,,CB
Functional biogeography of angiosperms: life at the extremes,"Nonlinear relationships between species and their environments are believed common in ecology and evolution, including during angiosperms' rise to dominance. Early angiosperms are thought of as woody evergreens restricted to warm, wet habitats. They have since expanded into numerous cold and dry places. This expansion may have included transitions across important environmental thresholds. To understand linear and nonlinear relationships between angiosperm structure and biogeographic distributions, we integrated large datasets of growth habits, conduit sizes, leaf phenologies, evolutionary histories, and environmental limits. We consider current-day patterns and develop a new evolutionary model to investigate processes that created them. The macroecological pattern was clear: herbs had lower minimum temperature and precipitation limits. In woody species, conduit sizes were smaller in evergreens and related to species' minimum temperatures. Across evolutionary timescales, our new modeling approach found conduit sizes in deciduous species decreased linearly with minimum temperature limits. By contrast, evergreen species had a sigmoidal relationship with minimum temperature limits and an inflection overlapping freezing. These results suggest freezing represented an important threshold for evergreen but not deciduous woody angiosperms. Global success of angiosperms appears tied to a small set of alternative solutions when faced with a novel environmental threshold.",10.1111/nph.15114,2018,J,"Zanne, AE; Pearse, WD; Cornwell, WK; McGlinn, DJ; Wright, IJ; Uyeda, JC",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,terrestrial,plants,global,size of water?conducting conduits; leaf phenology; woodiness,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,"COLE: would remove first parenthetical in the traits, and change last one to 'woodiness'",CB

Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of forest beta functional diversity for land-use analysis.

Climate mediates continental scale patterns of stream microbial functional diversity,"Background Understanding the large-scale patterns of microbial functional diversity is essential for anticipating climate change impacts on ecosystems worldwide. However, studies of functional biogeography remain scarce for microorganisms, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Here we study 15,289 functional genes of stream biofilm microbes along three elevational gradients in Norway, Spain and China. Results We find that alpha diversity declines towards high elevations and assemblage composition shows increasing turnover with greater elevational distances. These elevational patterns are highly consistent across mountains, kingdoms and functional categories and exhibit the strongest trends in China due to its largest environmental gradients. Across mountains, functional gene assemblages differ in alpha diversity and composition between the mountains in Europe and Asia. Climate, such as mean temperature of the warmest quarter or mean precipitation of the coldest quarter, is the best predictor of alpha diversity and assemblage composition at both mountain and continental scales, with local non-climatic predictors gaining more importance at mountain scale. Under future climate, we project substantial variations in alpha diversity and assemblage composition across the Eurasian river network, primarily occurring in northern and central regions, respectively. Conclusions We conclude that climate controls microbial functional gene diversity in streams at large spatial scales; therefore, the underlying ecosystem processes are highly sensitive to climate variations, especially at high latitudes. This biogeographical framework for microbial functional diversity serves as a baseline to anticipate ecosystem responses and biogeochemical feedback to ongoing climate change.",10.1186/s40168-020-00873-2,2020,J,"Picazo, F; Vilmi, A; Aalto, J; Soininen, J; Casamayor, EO; Liu, YQ; Wu, QL; Ren, LJ; Zhou, JZ; Shen, J; Wang, JJ",MICROBIOME,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,bacteria,global freshwater,C-cycle genes; N-cycle genes; P-cycle genes; S-cycle genes; stress-related genes,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,climate change,"Note: approach to approximating and measuring community, but not linking traits to environmental filtering","COLE: Hmm, not sure about this one.

Functional Biogeography as Evidence of Gene Transfer in Hypersaline Microbial Communities,"Background: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a major role in speciation and evolution of bacteria and archaea by controlling gene distribution within an environment. However, information that links HGT to a natural community using relevant population-genetics parameters and spatial considerations is scarce. The Great Salt Lake (Utah, USA) provides an excellent model for studying HGT in the context of biogeography because it is a contiguous system with dispersal limitations due to a strong selective salinity gradient. We hypothesize that in spite of the barrier to phylogenetic dispersal, functional characteristics-in the form of HGT-expand beyond phylogenetic limitations due to selective pressure. Methodology and Results: To assay the functional genes and microorganisms throughout the GSL, we used a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide microarray (Phylochip) and a functional gene array (GeoChip) to measure biogeographic patterns of nine microbial communities. We found a significant difference in biogeography based on microarray analyses when comparing Sorensen similarity values for presence/absence of function and phylogeny (Student's t-test; p = 0.005). Conclusion and Significance: Biogeographic patterns exhibit behavior associated with horizontal gene transfer in that informational genes (16S rRNA) have a lower similarity than functional genes, and functional similarity is positively correlated with lake-wide selective pressure. Specifically, high concentrations of chromium throughout GSL correspond to an average similarity of chromium resistance genes that is 22% higher than taxonomic similarity. This suggests active HGT may be measured at the population level in microbial communities and these biogeographic patterns may serve as a model to study bacteria adaptation and speciation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0012919,2010,J,"Parnell, JJ; Rompato, G; Latta, LC; Pfrender, ME; Van Nostrand, JD; He, ZL; Zhou, JZ; Andersen, G; Champine, P; Ganesan, B; Weimer, BC",PLOS ONE,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,freshwater,bacteria,hypersaline lake (Great Salk Lake),C degredation; C fixation; N fixation; nitrification; denitrification; N mineralization; sulfate reduction; methane redux/oxid; metal reduction; metal resistance; organic compound degredation/transformation,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB
Heterotrophic Extracellular Enzymatic Activities in the Atlantic Ocean Follow Patterns Across Spatial and Depth Regimes,"Heterotrophic microbial communities use extracellular enzymes to initialize degradation of high molecular weight organic matter in the ocean. The potential of microbial communities to access organic matter, and the resultant rates of hydrolysis, affect the efficiency of the biological pump as well as the rate and location of organic carbon cycling in surface and deep waters. In order to investigate spatial- and depth-related patterns in microbial enzymatic capacities in the ocean, we measured hydrolysis rates of six high-molecular-weight polysaccharides and two low-molecular-weight substrate proxies at sites spanning 38 degrees S to 10 degrees N in the Atlantic Ocean, and at six depths ranging from surface to bottom water. In surface to upper mesopelagic waters, the spectrum of substrates hydrolyzed followed distinct patterns, with hydrolytic assemblages more similar vertically within a single station than at similar depths across multiple stations. Additionally, the proportion of total hydrolysis occurring above the pycnocline, and the spectrum of substrates hydrolyzed in mesopelagic and deep waters, was positively related to the strength of stratification at a site, while other physichochemical parameters were generally poor predictors of the measured hydrolysis rates. Spatial as well as depth-driven constraints on heterotrophic hydrolytic capacities result in broad variations in potential carbon-degrading activity in the ocean. The spectrum of enzymatic capabilities and rates of hydrolysis in the ocean, and the proportion of organic carbon hydrolyzed above the permanent thermocline, may influence the efficiency of the biological pump and net carbon export across distinct latitudinal and depth regions.",10.3389/fmars.2017.00200,2017,J,"Hoarfrost, A; Arnosti, C",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,observational,marine,bacteria,Western Atlatnic coastal ocean,polysaccharide hydrolosis enzyme activites,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,CB

Although functional traits can provide such insights, a corresponding, coherent framework is lacking. Plant communities in refugia and endemism hotspots should, due to long-term environmental stability, display unique functional characteristics linked to distinct phylogenetic patterns. Therefore, such communities should be characterized by a functional signature that exhibits: (1) distinct values and combinations of traits, (2) higher functional diversity and (3) a prevalence of similar traits belonging to more distantly related lineages inside, compared to outside, of endemism hotspots and refugia. While the limited functional trait data available from refugia and endemism hotspots do not allow these predictions to be tested rigorously, three potential applications of the functional signature in biogeography and conservation planning are highlighted. Firstly, it allows the functional characteristics of endemism hotspots and refugia to be identified. Secondly, the strength of the functional signature can be compared among these entities, and with the surrounding landscape, to provide an estimate of the capacity of endemism hotspots and refugia to buffer environmental changes. Finally, the pattern of the functional signature can reveal ecological and evolutionary processes driving community assembly and functioning, which can assist in predicting the effect of environmental changes (e.g. climate, land-use) on communities in endemism hotspots and refugia. The proposed functional signature concept allows the systematic integration of plant functional traits and phylogeny into the study of endemism hotspots and refugia, but more data on functional traits in these entities are urgently needed. Overcoming this limitation would facilitate rigorous testing of the proposed predictions for the functional signature, advancing the eco-evolutionary understanding of endemism hotspots and refugia.",10.1093/aob/mcy173,2018,J,"Keppel, G; Ottaviani, G; Harrison, S; Wardell-Johnson, GW; Marcantonio, M; Mucina, L",ANNALS OF BOTANY,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,would this be included?,"COLE: no i probably wouln't include it.

Vegetation ecology meets ecosystem science: Permanent grasslands as a functional biogeography case study,"The effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has been widely acknowledged, and the importance of the functional roles of species, as well as their diversity, in the control of ecosystem processes has been emphasised recently. However, bridging biodiversity and ecosystem science to address issues at a biogeographic scale is still in its infancy. Bridging this gap is the primary goal of the emerging field of functional biogeography. While the rise of Big Data has catalysed functional biogeography studies in recent years, comprehensive evidence remains scarce. Here, we present the rationale and the first results of a country-wide initiative focused on the C-3 permanent grasslands. We aimed to collate, integrate and process large databases of vegetation releves, plant traits and environmental layers to provide a country-wide assessment of ecosystem properties and services which can be used to improve regional models of climate and land use changes. We outline the theoretical background, data availability, and ecoinformatics challenges associated with the approach and its feasibility. We provide a case study of upscaling of leaf drymatter content averaged at ecosystemlevel and country-wide predictions of forage digestibility. Our framework sets milestones for further hypothesis testing in functional biogeography and earth system modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Intraspecific body size variability in soil organisms at a European scale: Implications for functional biogeography,"Investigating the functional facet of biodiversity provides ecologists with a deeper understanding of community assembly and ecosystem processes, from local to biogeographical scales. A central assumption in functional ecology is that interspecific trait variability is higher than intraspecific variability. The ""stable species hierarchy"" hypothesis states that for similar species found in different environmental conditions, their species trait ranking is conserved. In this study, we applied this trait hierarchy concept prevalent in plant ecology to the growing field of soil functional ecology, for which newly developed trait databases are being increasingly used. However, to date there have been few attempts to test for patterns of intraspecific trait variability (ITV) in these databases. We thus aimed to characterize how such patterns might influence (a) a species hierarchy based on trait values and (b) the conclusions of a trait-based analysis at a community level. To examine this, we used Collembola body size data (extracted from the BETSI database) as model trait. The source consisted of four regional trait datasets (Poland, Scandinavia, Spain and UK) and one dataset for which species traits are defined at a continental (European) scale. We found that, firstly, species were consistently ranked in all the trait datasets, although slight differences were observed between continental and northern European (i.e. Scandinavia and UK) trait datasets. In the two northern datasets, body size was higher (ca. 10%), indicating an intraspecific body size gradient from temperate to colder northern regions that we assumed could be explained by latitudinal patterns. Secondly, using selected published species abundance matrices (from experimental studies), we calculated the community-weighted mean body size using various trait datasets. The findings showed that the slight discrepancies observed between trait datasets can lead to different conclusions. This work confirms that properly defining the extent of ITV in databases is of primary importance to ensure robust conclusions. This is particularly important for databases hosting large-scale data that might be influenced by biogeographical patterns as latitudinal gradients. We recommend using a local regional trait dataset when available or, if not, a continental trait dataset. As trait databases are now commonly used tools for performing trait-based analyses, it is crucial to carefully select the data used to make inferences.
